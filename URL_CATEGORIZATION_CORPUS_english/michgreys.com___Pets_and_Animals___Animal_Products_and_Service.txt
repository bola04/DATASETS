             HAPPY SPRING TO ALL OUR GREYHOUNDS AND THEIR FAMILIES!!  We have several events coming up including Pansies and Pets in Allen Park on May 19th and Ferndale Pride on June 2nd.  Please check our events page for a full listing.  We need volunteers to make these events a success. Sherrie is our volunteer coordinator and, if you can help out, you would make her oh so happy and have some fun for yourself and your houndies as well.  Contact Sherrie by phone or text at 630-564-2020.  She will fill you in on all the details and available volunteer opportunities.  We can't do it without you.
