     Email Search
    </h2>
    <p>
     Want to find an email address? While many free email search services can tell you who an email address belongs to, they do not let you lookup an email address by a person's name. Sometimes, that's all the info you have.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Emailfinder.com's robust, up-to-date email search gets you accurate, reliable email address search results simply by entering the name of the contact you would like to find. We search online email directories, including our own, search engine results, and even social network memberships to get you accurate information every time. We then show you all of this information in one convenient place, saving you the time and hassle of having to look through hundreds of search results and social networking sites.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What if you want to search for people by email address? We can do that too. Use our 'Search by Email' tool to find the name, physical address, telephone number, and more info about the sender of an email. You can also use the 'Search by Email' tool, commonly called reverse email lookup or search, to find out who sent you that suspicious email or to make sure a business email is legitimate. Just enter the email address you would like to lookup and we will do the rest.
    </p>
    <h2 class="footerText">

     <br/>
     <br/>

Our email lookup tool lets you find colleagues, long-lost friends, or relatives by email address. Whether the person you are looking for uses Yahoo mail, Hotmail, a company email, or Gmail, reverse lookup by Emailfinder.com will find them and get you the accurate information you need.
