It's been both a source of delight and comfort for her, but also the cause of an ongoing struggle with her weight. In <em>Food, Health, and Happiness</em>, Oprah shares the recipes that have allowed eating to finally be joyful for her. With dishes created and prepared alongside her favorite chefs, paired with personal essays and memories from Oprah herself, this cookbook offers a candid, behind-the-scenes look into the life (and kitchen!) of one of the most influential and respected celebrities in the world. Delicious, healthy, and easy to prepare, these are the recipes Oprah most loves to make at home and share with friends and family. From simple pleasures like Unfried Chicken and Turkey Chili, to such celebrations of freshness as Tuscan Kale and Apple Salad and Pasta Primavera, this is food as it should be: a taste of happiness, a ritual to be shared, a toast to life. <em>Color photos</em>.</p>\n","url":"FOOD-HEALTH-HAPPINESS","available_date":"January 03, 2017","pages":240,"msrp":35,"publisher":26,"imprint":null,"quantity_available":198,"sale_price":9.99,"quantity_on_backorder":0,"visible":1,"backorder_arrival_date":"0000-00-00","bundle_pricing":1,"excludeFromPromos":1,"categories":[36,53,59,69,86,88,89,90,91,92,94,2,5,10,47,63],"authors":[3649],"genres":[262,345,346,347,348,50,209,349,53,141,75,344,21,30],"promos":[]}],[6202,{"id":6202,"mmid":1415381,"netsuite_id":150179,"isbn":"9781683314325","title":"An Amish Summer","subtitle":null,"description":"<p><strong><em>Celebrate a season of love</em></strong></p>\n<p>Feel the romance with these four heartfelt Amish novellas.</p>\n<p><strong>A Reunion in Pinecraft by Shelley Shepard Gray</strong></p>\n<p>After sisters Sharon and Sherilyn meet Graham, he accidentally becomes a pen pal with the wrong one.
