          <p>
           For the first time this season, the Yankees will play in Tropicana Field. They’re in Tampa for three games this weekend.
          </p>
          <h2>
           The Last Time They Met
          </h2>
          <p>
           It seems like just yesterday that the Yankees hosted the Rays, but that’s not quite true; in fact, it was last week. The Rays visited the Bronx last weekend, and the good guys took three out of four by a combined score of 14 to 7. A few notes from the series:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Jonathan Loaisiga made his big league debut in the second game of the series, and was incredibly impressive in doing so. He tossed 5 scoreless innings and allowed seven total base-runners, while striking out 6.
           </li>
           <li>
            Kevin Cash, the Rays manager,
            <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/recap?gameId=380615110">
             compared Loaisiga to Mariano Rivera
            </a>
            after the game – and that’s equal parts wonderful and insane.
           </li>
           <li>
            Luis Severino, not to be outdone, was even better the following day, pitching to the following line – 8.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 9 K. That represents the second-best start of his career by Game Score.
           </li>
           <li>
            Didi Gregorius had a big series, going 6-for-11 with a triple and a home run, and that may well have been the jump-start to awakening from his slumber.
           </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>
           Injury Report
          </h2>
          <p>
           Chris Archer is still on the disabled list with a strained abdominal muscle, and is slated for a bullpen session today – which means he’s still a couple of weeks away, and that’s without any setbacks. Starting pitcher Jake Faria is out until August with an oblique injury, and pitching prospects Jose De Leon, Anthony Banda, and Brent Honeywell are all out for the season due to Tommy John Surgery, as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the position player side of things, Christian Arroyo and Daniel Robertson are both on the disabled list. Neither is expected to be out long, but their return dates remain TBD.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Their Story So Far
          </h2>
          <p>
           The Rays are 34-40 with a -17 run differential, and have spent much of the season jockeying for third place in the division with the Blue Jays. They’re quite a bit better at home, though, with a 15-16 record and a +15 run differential, so they’ve got that going for them.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are still using an “opener” in lieu of a traditional starter in a sizable portion of their games, with Blake Snell and Nate Eovaldi serving as the only true starting pitchers on the roster right now. The opener tends to hand the ball over to a long reliever after the first or second inning, which results in some intriguing box scores. It has been a mixed bag, but it is difficult to fault the Rays for trying something new when they have five MLB or MLB-ready starting pitchers on the disabled list.
          </p>
          <h2>
           The Lineup We Might See
          </h2>
          <p>
           Despite the injuries to Arroyo and Robertson, the Rays offense is just about at full-strength, as Kevin Kiermaier has returned from the DL and prospects Jake Bauers and Willy Adames garnered promotions. We’ll probably see something along these lines:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Kevin Kiermaier, CF – .135/.211/.192, 0 HR, 1 SB, 15 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            Matt Duffy, 3B – .317/.360/.439, 4 HR, 4 SB, 125 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            Jake Bauers, 1B – .250/.379/.458, 1 HR, 0 SB, 136 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            Wilson Ramos, C – .288/.337/.447, 9 HR, 0 SB, 119 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            C.J. Cron, DH – .237/.316/.452, 16 HR, 1 SB, 114 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            Joey Wendle, 2B – .272/.316/.364, 2 HR, 6 SB, 92 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            Willy Adames, SS – .182/.229/.273, 1 HR, 0 SB, 41 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            Mallex Smith, LF – .276/.341/.360, 0 HR, 13 SB, 99 OPS+
           </li>
           <li>
            Johnny Field, RF – .224/.260/.401, 6 HR, 4 SB, 83 OPS+
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Carlos Gomez (.191/.264/332) and Adeiny Hechavarria (.285/.312/.354) will find their way into the lineup, as well.

          <h2>
           The Starting (Opening) Pitchers We Will See
          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Friday (7:10 PM EST): LHP CC Sabathia vs. RHP Ryne Stanek
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Stanek has opened six games this season, pitching to the following line: 9.0 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 3 BB, 9 K. That’s … surprisingly good. Of course, he has only completed the second inning once (and has maxed-out at 40 total pitches), so the Rays will lean heavily on the bullpen once he leaves the game. He opened against the Yankees last Saturday, and he threw a scoreless 1.1 innings. The Yankees won that game 4-1.
          </p>
          <p>
           Stanek is a flamethrower, featuring a high-90s four-seamer, a high-80s splitter, and a high-80s slider. Those two breaking balls are legitimate swing and miss offerings, too.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Last outing (vs. HOU on 6/19) – 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 1 K
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Saturday (4:10 PM EST): RHP Sonny Gray vs. RHP Wilmer Font
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Rays are Font’s third organization this season, and it’s not too difficult to understand why when you see his 7.56 ERA with the Dodgers and A’s. However, he has been quite good for the Rays, pitching to a 2.20 ERA (184 ERA+) in 16.1 IP; he’s also being stretched-out to be an actual starter, with his pitch counts climbing by 15-plus pitches in each of his last three outings. He’s only pitched into the fifth inning once, but it stands to reason that he can go deeper into the game if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Font throws five pitches – a mid-90s four-seamer, a mid-90s sinker, a mid-80s change-up, a mid-80s slider, and a mid-70s curve. It’s a starter’s arsenal and he only recently turned 28, so the Rays might’ve found something here.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Last outing (vs. NYY on 6/17) – 4.1 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 5 K
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Sunday (1:10 PM EST): RHP Domingo German vs. LHP Blake Snell
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Yankees roughed Snell up last week, scoring four runs in five innings and putting nine runners on-base. Snell – who was taken one pick after Dante Bichette Jr. back in 2011 – has otherwise been one of the best starters in baseball this year. And he has a 0.96 ERA at Tropicana Field.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Last outing (vs. HOU on 6/19) – 7.0 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 7 BB, 6 K
           </em>
          </p>
          <h2>
           The Bullpen
          </h2>
          <p>
           The Rays currently employ a closer-by-committee, with Sergio Romo (5.46 ERA), Jose Alvarado (3.00 ERA), and Chaz Roe (2.79 ERA) seeing most of the ninth inning action. They also have a trio of long relievers in Austin Pruitt, Matt Andriese, and Ryan Yarbrough – at least one of which will come in to relieve Stanek today – and one of the best stories in baseball in Jonny Venters.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Who (Or What) To Watch
          </h2>
          <p>
           I’m excited to see how Domingo German follows up on his terrific outing against the Mariners, as well as the prospect of a pitchers duel between him and Snell. And the Rays in general fascinate me, with their aggressive bullpen-ing and high-risk approach on the bases.

           <b>
            Domingo+Dingers=Win
           </b>
           <br/>
           After a quick trip to the nation’s capital, the Yankees were back at the friendly confines on Tuesday night and opened their series with an easy 7-2 win over the Mariners.
          </p>
          <p>
           Domingo German was absolutely brilliant in his eighth career start. After giving up a run (unearned) in the first inning, he retired 19(!) straight batters before Nelson Cruz tagged him with a solo homer in the seventh. He pitched a career-high seven innings, surrendering just two hits while striking out nine and walking none.
          </p>
          <p>
           It was the second time this season he’s allowed no more than two hits and gotten at least nine strikeouts, earning our #funfact of the series: Since his first start on May 6, the only other MLB pitcher to have two games with those stats (2 or fewer hits and 9 or more strikeouts) is Chris Sale.
          </p>
          <p>
           German’s dominance has peaked in the last two weeks. Over his last three starts, 28 of the 51 outs (55%) he’s recorded have come via strikeout. And for the season, he’s shown elite swing-and-miss stuff, with a 15.7 percent swinging strike rate that is the second-highest among all pitchers with at least 40 innings pitched.

           Giancarlo Stanton ignited the Yankees home run derby with a game-tying solo shot in the bottom of the first inning off Mariners southpaw Marco Gonzales. He entered the game with a .435 ISO (

          <p>
           Miguel Andujar made sure the fans at Yankee Stadium would go home happy, crushing a career-long 427-foot home run in the fifth inning that put the team ahead 3-1. Aaron Hicks added a few insurance runs with his own two-run bomb later in the fifth, going deep in back-to-back-to-back games for the first time in his career.

           Finally, Gleyber Torres capped off the dinger party with monster blast in the eighth inning, his 14th of the season. It wouldn’t be a Gleyber Day without the obligatory Mickey Mantle/Joe DiMaggio comparison:

            The newest True Yankee
           </b>
           <br/>
           The Comeback Kids were back in the Bronx on Wednesday as the Yankees staged yet another improbable rally to beat the Mariners, 7-5, after trailing 5-0 in the fifth inning. It was their biggest comeback win of the season; before Wednesday, they were 0-6 when trailing by at least five runs in a game. It’s been a couple weeks since their last walk-off victory, so let’s recap and update some of the statistical goodness that’s defined this never-say-die 2018 Yankees season:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sixth walk-off win of the season, one more than they had all of last year and tied for the most in the AL. The last time the Yankees had six walk-off wins this early into the schedule (71st game) was 2009.
           </li>
           <li>
            Third walk-off homer of season, tied for the most in the AL and the same number they had all of last year. The last time they had three walk-off dingers this early into the season was 2009.
           </li>
           <li>
            23rd comeback win of season, the most in the majors. By the way, the 2009 team also had 23 comeback wins in their first 71 games.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Hmmm … sensing a trend there.

           Gary Sanchez was the first hero of the night, tying the game in the eighth with a massive 439-foot two-run homer. It was his team-best third home run in the eighth inning or later that either tied the game or gave the team a lead; he had never hit one of those before 2018. The Yankees are now 11-0 in games that Sanchez goes deep this year.
          </p>
          <p>
           Giancarlo Stanton then capped the rally with a two-out, two-strike mammoth shot over the wall in left-center. It was his fourth career walk-off longball and first as a Yankee. The poor baseball went a projected 453 feet, the longest walk-off home run recorded by Statcast (since 2015).

           And to celebrate his first True Yankee Moment, let’s give Stanton our Obscure Yankeemetric of the Series: Over the last 30 years (when we have reliable pitch data), he is just the second Yankee to hit a two-out walk-off homer in an 0-2 count. The other was Jason Giambi on June 5, 2008 against the Blue Jays off reliever B.J. Ryan in the bottom of the ninth.

           Because this team simply refuses to lose … the Yankees completed the sweep of the Mariners on Thursday afternoon, holding on for a 4-3 win.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are now 19-18 when scoring four runs or fewer this season; every other team is at least three games under .500 in that situation. Looking ahead, the last MLB team to finish with a winning record in games when scoring no more than four runs was the 1979 Astros (57-56), and the last AL team to do it was the 1954 Cleveland Indians (41-39).

           The Bronx Bombers did all their scoring in the first inning, as Aaron Judge and Miguel Andujar both smashed two-run homers to give the Yankees an early 4-0 advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
           Andujar’s blast was his 10th of the season, making the Yankees the only team in MLB with seven double-digit homer players in 2018 (Red Sox have six). The only other time in the last 15 seasons that the Yankees had seven players hit at least 10 dingers before July 1 was 2009.
          </p>
          <p>
           The third baseman joined Gleyber Torres in the 10-homer club, producing yet another pinstriped record: they are the first set of Yankee rookie infielders to hit at least 10 homers in the same season. The last pair of Yankee rookie teammates
           <i>
            at any position
           </i>
           to do it were Gil McDougald and Mickey Mantle in 1951.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally this was also their 50th win in 2018, an important milestone considering this stat: It’s the eighth time that the Yankees have reached the 50-win mark in their first 72 games, and here’s how the previous seven seasons ended:

            Ryan asks: Any explanation for the power Torres is showing in the majors? I think I read he had only 24 homers in like 1,500 at bats in the minors. Seems to be somewhat common with guys having better power numbers in the majors. Any insight would be great!
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Gleyber Torres has hit 14 homers in 52 big league games so far. His career high in the minors was eleven homers in 125 games in 2016. Torres is certainly not the only prospect to come up from the minors and hit for more power than ever before. Aaron Judge did it, Cody Bellinger did it, Gary Sanchez did it, Albert Pujols did it. Lots of guys have done it. Torres is not the first nor will he be the last.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are a few reasons for this. One, they’re seeing more pitches in the zone than they do in the minors because MLB pitchers are just better, and MLB pitchers tend to challenge young guys until they prove they can do damage. Two, the baseball itself is different and the many of the ballparks are smaller. Three, they have access to better advance scouting and video work. And four, many of these dudes are young players who are still developing physically, and they get stronger. It’s kinda weird, but showing more power in the big leagues than the minors happens often.

            Bart asks: Rule 5 Draft. Your thoughts on Dermis Garcia (is he not “special” and worth protecting) and Adams performance seems just short of what is needed (more patience or trade him?).
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Unless Garcia goes completely bonkers the rest of the way, there’s no way the Yankees should add him to the 40-man roster after the season. He’s yet to play above Low-A and he’s still swinging and missing a bunch (31.9% strikeouts and 14.8% whiffs), plus he’s a defensive liability. Maybe the Padres will live with an ugly strikeout filled season to get Dermis into their organization, but I can’t see him sticking in the big leagues next year. Not one bit.
          </p>
          <p>
           As for Chance Adams, he has been legitimately bad this season, throwing 65.2 Triple-A innings with a 5.21 ERA (4.54 FIP) and too many walks (11.1%). Yes,

           . It’s also mid June now. You’d think he’d be over the bone spur surgery by now. The Yankees shouldn’t make him off limits in a trade, of course, but I’d stay the course and keep running him out there. Protect him from the Rule 5 Draft after the season and see where we’re at then.

            Seth asks: Don’t you think Jonny Lasagna looks a lot like Ramiro Mendoza from those great 90’s teams? And would you be ok with Loaisiga turning into Mendoza or would you hope to see more from him?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I think Jonathan Loaisiga has the stuff and command to start long-term. Can he stay healthy? That’s the big question. But I think the ingredients are there to start. Right now he just looks like an inexperienced rookie, which is in no way surprising. If Loaisiga has trouble staying healthy as a starter, a relief role would work too, and a Mendoza-esque role would be great. That’s basically Adam Warren, right? That do anything Swiss Army Knife reliever. That strikes me as a role the Yankees will be able to fill internally going forward, either with Loaisiga or Adams or Domingo German. Or maybe someone else.

            Julian asks: Brett Gardner says he wants to play 2-3 more years. If he finishes his career with the Yankees would he be in consideration for a plaque in Monument Park?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Man, that’s tough. Gardner has been a great Yankee but he’s never been the star or the biggest name on the team, and he’s never been a core member of a World Series champion. (He was the fourth outfielder in 2009.) That could change in the coming years — I sure hope it does! — but, if it doesn’t, Gardner will have spent about 14 seasons with the Yankees as a high-end complementary player. Is that Monument Park worthy? Gardner is basically the poor man’s Willie Randolph and it took almost 20 years for Randolph to get a plaque. As good as he’s been, it’s hard for me to think Gardner gets a plaque. A few World Series titles before he retires could definitely change things though.

            Mike asks: Drury is killing it in AAA right now, but for the Yankees he’s really nothing more than depth at this point. Solak and Widener are both playing very well at AAA. In addition, the Rays have been playing Solak in the OF to increase his versatility. At this point, does Drury have more value to the Yankees than Solak and Widener would? Even if he does now, would he in the long term? Who would get more in a trade?

          </p>
          <p>
           I think Brandon Drury has more value to the Yankees than the two prospects because they could plug Drury into the big league lineup tomorrow. Nick Solak and Taylor Widener are good prospects, don’t get me wrong, but the only way they’d help the 2018 Yankees is as trade chips, and I don’t think they’re guys who could net you an impact pitcher. They’re second or third piece in a package types and

           </a>
           . Having a league average (maybe better) player like Drury stashed in Triple-A as depth is a tremendous luxury for a contending team. The two prospects wouldn’t move the needle much this year, and I’m not sure where Solak or Widener would fit long-term anyway. It’s Drury or the mystery box, right? Do you want Drury or whatever you could hypothetically trade Solak and Widener for?

            Anonymous asks: It seems like everyone throws 98 these days. Are players actually throwing harder or did something else change? I seem to recall that a few years ago PitchFX started picking the ball up out of the pitchers hand as opposed to when it crosses home plate.

           Pitchers are absolutely throwing harder than ever before, though there has been a change in velocity measurements. PitchFX measures velocity at 55 feet from home plate.

           Average velocity tends to increase during the season because pitchers usually reach midseason form in the hot summer months, and because a bunch of hard-throwers join rosters in September.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even if the average velocity this year drops a bit from last year, pitchers are still throwing harder than at any other point in baseball history. It seems like every dude who comes up from the minors is throwing 97+ these days. Will we one day reach the point where 95 mph is the average velocity? And if the answer is yes, what does that mean for baseball?

            Dan asks: You said the Yankees should add another starter and maybe another reliever. I totally agree. How about 1B though. Would you look for an upgrade if Bird doesn’t improve till the trade deadline? Seems like that’s the only weak-ish spot in the lineup.

          <p>
           If Greg Bird is still hitting .206/.295/.423 (96 wRC+) or thereabouts come the trade deadline, then absolutely go get a first baseman, preferably left-handed. Don’t give the job to Tyler Austin, don’t give to the Brandon Drury, don’t give it to Neil Walker, don’t give Clint Frazier a first baseman’s glove, nothing like that. Go get an actual first baseman. Dudes like Lucas Duda and Justin Bour are going to be available, maybe Jose Abreu too. Stick with Bird for now, but if we’re sitting here in five weeks and we’re still waiting for him to get going, then it’s time to stop waiting.

            Michael asks: Any concern/thoughts on Judge’s increase in GB%? It was 34.9% last year and has ballooned to 44% this year.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Going into yesterday’s game Aaron Judge had a 44.9% ground ball rate this season, which is up ten percentage points from last season. That’s significant. His ISO has dropped from .343 to .277, and while that’s still elite, it is down quite a bit from last year. A graph:
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-173386" height="486" src="http://cdn.riveraveblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Aaron-Judge-ground-ball-rate-min.jpg" width="640"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           Not a good trend! You want Judge to hit the ball in the air. When Judge hits the ball in the air, very good things happen. As long as the shoulder is healthy, and there’s no reason to believe it isn’t, I’m not really worried about the spike in grounders. It’s not like he hasn’t been great this season.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think pitchers have adjusted to Judge a bit — they’ve been jamming him inside more often, it’s seemed to me — and now it’s up to him to adjust back. It’s all part of the cat-and-mouse game. Give Judge time and he’ll figure it out. He’s too good not to.

            Vismay asks: This pitcher has a 19.6% K-BB% (top 20), 13.8% swStr% rate (top 6), but low 35.3 GB% and his batted ball rates are kinda messy: 89.3 avg exit velocity and 37.9% hard hit rates. The pitcher is Dylan Bundy. Potential trade target and one who can benefit from the anti-fastball approach?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Bundy has some tools. He gets a ton of swings and misses with his secondary pitches (slider, curveball, changeup), and while his fastball doesn’t jump out in terms of velocity, it does have an above-average spin rate, which allows it to play up a bit. Bundy doesn’t get ground balls and is awfully home run prone though (1.5 HR/9 since 2016), which is a bad mix for Yankee Stadium. There’s some Masahiro Tanaka here. Bundy has great secondaries, but when he catches too much of the plate, hitters make him pay.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bundy’s injury history is a huge red flag for me. He’s had all sorts of arm problems, including Tommy John surgery and shoulder trouble, and those injuries have already robbed him of his fastball. Plus Buck Showalter really works Bundy hard. He’s thrown as many as 121 pitches in a game this season and Showalter always seems to try to get that one extra inning out of him. Bundy is interesting. I’m just not sure I’d trust a pitcher this fly ball and home run prone in Yankee Stadium long-term, especially with that injury history.

            Michael asks: As of now, Judge is 59/8 in games at RF/DH. Stanton has played about half and half between the combined corners/DH. Is Stanton being rested more b/c of his knee/injury history, and should the DH time be split a little more evenly between the two giants?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           After yesterday, Judge is at 60 starts in right and eight games at DH (and one in center). I am surprised he hasn’t spent more time at DH. I thought it would be closer to a 50/50 split to be honest, or maybe 60/40 in favor of right field. Giancarlo Stanton is certainly comfortable playing right field and giving Judge some time off his feet isn’t a bad idea. He’s a big dude and he’s carrying a lot of weight around. Running around the outfield every day at that size is physically demanding. Maybe we’ll see him get more DH time as the season progresses, especially if the Yankees open up a big lead?
          </p>
          <p>
           As for Stanton, there are three possible reasons he is spending so much time at DH. One, Aaron Boone doesn’t know what he’s doing and isn’t spreading the outfield load around. (I’d bet the farm against this being the actual reason.) Two, the Yankees are protecting Stanton physically. He’s had several leg injuries over the years, including hamstring and knee problems, so they’re taking it easy on him. And three, they think Judge is the better defender and want him in the outfield as much as possible. Not unreasonable. I would like to see Judge get some more DH time just to take it easy on his legs, but the Yankees do know what they’re doing, so I’ll defer to them.

           What started as a laugher ended as a bit of a nail-biter. But, a win is a win. The Yankees completed the three-game sweep of the Mariners on Thursday afternoon to pick up their 50th win of the season. Fifty wins in 72 games. Last year the 50th win came in the 95th game. Smell ya later, Mariners.

             Four in the First
            </strong>
           </span>
           <br/>
           Three home runs in the first inning but only two made it over the fence. Pretty good start to the game, I’d say. Luis Severino fired a quick 1-2-3 top of the first and the offense put up a four-spot in the bottom half, and it would’ve been a five-spot had Mitch Haniger not robbed Giancarlo Stanton’s center field home run. Would’ve been three straight games with a dinger for Stanton. Alas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Anyway, Clint Frazier opened the first inning with a solid single to right field. Going back to Wednesday night, it was the third straight at-bat he laced a ball the other way. Aaron Judge followed that by inside-outing a 95.8 mph fastball into the right field seats for a quick 2-0 lead. Look at this:
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173332" height="276" src="http://cdn.riveraveblues.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Aaron-Judge-James-Paxton-min.jpg" width="371"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           A mere mortal inside-outs that ball into shallow right field for a single. Judge muscled it into the seats. Pretty amazing. Stanton followed that with his robbed home run, then Gleyber Torres singled to left and Miguel Andujar went opposite field for a cheap two-run home run into the short porch. The home run details:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Judge:
            </strong>
            107.8 mph exit velocity and 382 feet
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Stanton:
            </strong>
            108.6 mph exit velocity and 414 feet
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Andujar:
            </strong>
            94.8 mph exit velocity and 339 feet
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Of course Stanton’s was caught. Go figure. Still a good start against the very good James Paxton. A great start, really. Paxton is a tough assignment and the Yankees put four runs on the board in the first inning, and it should’ve been five.
          </p>

           <br/>
           Not a good start for Luis Severino. Not a terrible start either, but it wasn’t good, especially by his standards. The Mariners worked him for three runs on eight hits and a walk in 5.2 innings, and he needed 107 pitches to do it. Severino walked Nelson Cruz on five pitches to begin the second, then left a changeup right out over the plate for a Kyle Seager two-run homer. The Yankees scored four in the bottom of the first and the Mariners halved that lead eight pitches into the top of the second. Blah.
          </p>
          <p>
           Severino’s only 1-2-3 inning was the first. He pitched around leadoff doubles in the fourth and fifth, but wasn’t able to pitch around a one-out single in the sixth. Cruz and Seager strung together back-to-back one out singles in the sixth, and Ben Gamel got Cruz home with a two-out single to center. Of those season high tying eight hits Severino allowed, four came in two-strike counts. The five strikeouts tie a season low and the 12 swings and misses are his second lowest total of the year. A real grind for Severino, this was. Didn’t look sharp at all.

           </span>
           <br/>
           On paper, Severino vs. Paxton was a great pitching matchup. So course there were six runs on the board three half-innings into the game. Neither pitcher was sharp, though Paxton was able to keep the Yankees off the board following that four-run first inning. Most notably, he struck out Austin Romine to strand the bases loaded in the third. Romine swung at ball four, which is mildly annoying.
          </p>
          <p>
           The bullpen battle started in earnest in the seventh inning. David Robertson got the final out of the sixth to strand the two runners he inherited from Severino and pitched around a leadoff single in the seventh thanks in part to a

            gift strike three call on Mitch Haniger
           </a>
           . That sure helped. The Yankees in turn wasted a two on, one out opportunity in the bottom of the seventh. Torres struck out and Andujar grounded out. Groan.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the eighth, Aaron Boone when to the untouchable of late Dellin Betances, who pitched around a two-out walk. He struck out two and has now struck out 14 of the last 20 batters he’s faced. That is: Good. After the Yankees went down 1-2-3 in the eighth — 12 of the final 14 batters they send to the plate made outs — Aroldis Chapman pitched around a one-out walk int he ninth. This was Chapman’s tenth appearance in the last 18 days. Give him the weekend off, offense.
          </p>

           Tough 0-for-4 for Stanton. He did strike out twice against Paxton, but he also had a home run robbed, and a 101.6 mph liner find Denard Span’s glove in left field. Leadoff hitter Clint Frazier had two hits, as did Gregorius and Torres. Judge and Andujar each had a single and a walk, and … that’s it. The 7-8-9 hitters went a combined 0-for-10 with two walks.
          </p>
          <p>
           Frazier started his first big league game in center field Thursday afternoon — Boone said he wanted to give Aaron Hicks a day off, and Brett Gardner’s hurt, so Clint it was — and he didn’t have any tough plays. Caught a fly ball and did a nice job cutting a ball off in the gap to hold the hitter to a double. That’s about it. All things considered, a good came in center.
          </p>
          <p>
           And finally, the Yankees have now played exactly one-third of a season (54 games) since their 9-9 start. They are 41-13 in those 54 games. That is a) a 123-win pace, and b) their best 54-game stretch since 1998. At one point that 1998 team went 45-9 in 54 games. Good gravy.

           According to
           <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/20/gleyber-torres-takes-derby-decision-out-of-mlbs-hands/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

           , Gleyber Torres said he will pass on participating in the Home Run Derby next month. It’s unknown whether MLB has invited him, but it doesn’t matter now. Torres will pass. “I’m not a home-run hitter. I’m a contact hitter,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
           Gleyber may not seem like the Home Run Derby type, but there are a few things to keep in mind here. One, MLB definitely wants a Yankee involved to generate buzz, and an exciting young Yankee would be preferable. Two, Torres has socked a lot of dingers lately. Here is the home run leaderboard since the day he was called up:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <strong>
             J.D. Martinez:
            </strong>
            18
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Jose Ramirez:
            </strong>
            17
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Mike Trout:
            </strong>
            15
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Khris Davis:
            </strong>
            15
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Gleyber Torres:
            </strong>
            14 (tied with five others)
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           And three, several big names have already says they’re going to pass on the Home Run Derby this year,
           <a href="http://riveraveblues.com/2018/03/aaron-judge-says-hes-probably-one-done-home-run-derby-167082/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
            including Aaron Judge
           </a>
           . Others like J.D. Martinez and Mookie Betts have said they’re unlikely to take their hacks in the Home Run Derby. Even Bryce Harper is supposed on the fence and the game is at Nationals Park.
          </p>
          <p>
           With so many big name players passing on the Home Run Derby, MLB needs some guys fans want to see — Justin Bour and Charlie Blackmon were in the Home Run Derby last year, and no offense to them, but not many folks tuned in to see those two hit — and Torres is definitely one of those guys. Instead, he’s passing.
          </p>
          <p>
           I’d bet the farm on at least one Yankee participating in the Home Run Derby. MLB wants a Yankee there. With Judge and Torres out, Giancarlo Stanton makes sense, especially since he’s done it a bunch of times before and won it two years ago. I suppose Gary Sanchez is a possibility too. Maybe Miguel Andujar? We’ll see. I’d bet on there being at least one Yankee sin the Home Run Derby though.
          </p>
          <p>
           Torres, 21, came into today hitting .287/.344/.556 (142 wRC+) with those 14 home runs in 51 big league games. He’s not going to beat out Jose Altuve in the fan voting for a spot in the starting lineup, but Gleyber definitely has a chance to go to the All-Star Game as a rookie.
