The discussions in this book range from the personal to the political, from Russia to America, from little-known episodes to today's international headlines. The Putin who emerges is deeply committed to Russia's national interests, but in ways that should make him America's essential national security partner-not, as is so often insisted, its ‘No. 1 enemy.'

When one takes the opportunity to spend time with Vladimir Putin through the interviews, one cannot help but see his humanity, intelligence, and complete lack of antipathy towards the US.

Milner II</strong></p>\n<p>In less than a year, a set of substantial books, all selected for the History Book Club, have allowed readers to reconsider major aspects of the nineteenth-century American West. <em>Thunder in the Mountains</em> by Daniel J. Sharfstein deserves to be included with these works that start with Paul Andrew Hutton and <em>The Apache Wars</em>, include John Mack Faragher's examination of violence in frontier Los Angeles, extend to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's assessment of the lives of Mormon women in polygamy, and culminate with <em>Custer's Trials</em> by T. J. Stiles that received the Pulitzer Prize. In many ways, Sharfstein's book best parallels what Stiles did with Custer's military career. He looks at the dramatic story of the Nez Perce War in the larger context of the lives of Chief Joseph and General Oliver Otis Howard.</p>\n<p>For most readers, Chief Joseph is the better-known figure especially because of the fame given his surrender speech in 1877 that proclaimed in Joseph's later retelling, &quot;From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more.&quot; Indeed, General Howard found that in subsequent decades his public life seemed yoked to that of his former Nez Perce adversary. As late as 1904, Howard and Joseph both spoke at the graduation ceremony at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Sharfstein recounts this poignant scene and many other remarkable episodes. The book begins with Howard's participation in the Civil War battle of Fair Oaks on June 1, 1862 where he will lose his right arm. The story then jumps to La Grande, Oregon on July 4, 1872 where Joseph and his brother Ollokot introduce themselves to the white settlers of the community. The narrative continues along these parallel but often entwined paths. In April, 1875, Howard now living in Portland, Oregon and in command of the army's Department of the Columbia will make an inspection tour of eastern Oregon where he first meets Joseph face-to-face.</p>\n<p>Eventually the desperate flight of the Nez Perce from their beloved homeland and the extraordinary set of battles that follow provide the core of this book. During and after the war, two other figures, the Nez Perce warrior Yellow Wolf and the young army officer Charles Erskine Scott Wood, become important in Sharfstein's account. Each man lived well into the twentieth century and each was deeply affected by what Yellow Wolf called &quot;the war we did not want.&quot; Sharfstein makes clear the impact of the Nez Perce War for those swept up in its violence as well as for others who agonized over the fate of Chief Joseph and his people.</p>\n<p><strong>Review Quotes</strong></p>\n<p><em>&quot;One of the epic tales of American history, rendered by a master storyteller. Daniel Sharfstein breathes new life into the fascinating figures at the heart of the Nez Perce War.&quot;-Karl Jacoby, author of The Strange Career of William Ellis: The Texas Slave Who Became a Mexican Millionaire</em></p>\n<p><em>&quot;Beautifully wrought and impossible to put down, Daniel Sharfstein's Thunder in the Mountains chronicles with compassion and grace that resonant past we should never forget.&quot;-Brenda Wineapple, author of Ecstatic Nation: Confidence, Crisis, and Compromise, 1848-1877</em></p>\n<p><em>&quot;Daniel Sharfstein offers a searing account of an American tragedy: how Oliver Otis Howard, a champion for the rights of freed slaves, became an architect of the dispossession and subjugation of Native people.

A compelling portrait of an epoch-making figure...Readers explore the complexities of [Lenin's] personality: sophisticated intellectual and shameless demagogue, cerebral logician and emotional rageaholic, sensitive lover of music and callous murderer. But no complexities will fascinate readers more than those characterizing Lenin's tangled relationships with the women who influenced him.&quot;-<em>Booklist</em> (starred review)</p>\n<p>&quot;Richly readable... Sebestyen does full justice to the astonishing, thriller-like tale of [Lenin's] return to Russia to organize the October uprising...Lenin saw enemies everywhere.

Even Josef Stalin was rebuked for not being ‘merciless' enough...An enthralling but appalling story.&quot;-<em>The Mail on Sunday</em></p>\n<p>&quot;In his engagingly written biography the author ... captures all the drama of Lenin's leadership against a back ground of imperial collapse, the ravages of war and the building of a dictatorship ... the Bolshevik leader emerges from these pages as a man unencumbered by critical self-awareness, by doubts or by any moral conflict over the extraordinary costs inflicted on others by the pursuit of his revolutionary goals.&quot;-<em>The Guardian</em></p>\n<p><strong>About The Author</strong></p>\n<p>Victor Sebestyen has written for numerous British and American newspapers, including <em>the Daily Mail</em>, <em>the London Evening Standard</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em>.

Powe, Jr.</strong></p>\n<p>James Madison's partnership with Thomas Jefferson has been the subject of several books. In the early 1790s they created an opposition party to the reigning Federalists, and at the end of the decade provided the intellectual opposition to the Federalist's overreach in the Alien and Sedition Acts. When Jefferson won the presidency he gave Madison the State Department, the prime cabinet position. What makes David O. Stewart's new book, <em>Madison's Gift: Five Partnerships that Built America</em> special is his recognition that Madison habitually partnered with someone else with important consequences for the United States.</p>\n<p>Madison's first collaboration was with Alexander Hamilton. The two young men met in 1782 in the Continental Congress. Hamilton, with his wartime experience, already believed a new government was necessary. Soon Madison would, too. Both were delegates at the failed Annapolis Convention and they formed an alliance that over the next two years would lead to the creation and ratification of the Constitution. Together they created <em>The Federalist</em>, a propaganda machine to support ratification and the most important political essays in American history.</p>\n<p>Few could equal George Washington as a talent spotter and from the mid-1780s through 1790 Washington sought and accepted Madison's sage advice. There is one diary entry where Washington simply wrote: &quot;I remained at home all day with Mr. Madison.&quot; In the First Congress Madison sponsored, drafted, or shaped most of the major legislation. The relationship, like that with Hamilton, ended when Washington disagreed on financial issues.</p>\n<p>Next Stewart records Madison's long relationship with Jefferson where as Secretary of State he and Jefferson adopted an anti-British foreign policy at some cost to the new nation.</p>\n<p>Madison's relationship with the handsome, dashing James Monroe had real bumps. They ran against each other for the First Congress in a district gerrymandered for Madison to lose (but he won), but their friendship endured. Monroe tried to best Madison for the Republican presidential nomination to succeed Jefferson. That was caused in large part by Madison's repudiation of a treaty Monroe negotiated with the British that went against Madison's instructions. The result was that Madison passed over Monroe in forming his (dysfunctional) cabinet. Before the War of 1812 Madison corrected that mistake and the two were at the helm with a war policy that at the end left the status quo intact.</p>\n<p>The final relationship was with his wife, Dolley Todd Madison. As &quot;a foe of dullness&quot; she helped bring out the shy Madison and made the couple social fixtures for members of both parties.</p>\n<p>David Stewart had an excellent idea-write a biography of Madison through the lens of five partners. <em>Madison's Gift</em> represents a perfect execution of that idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Review Quotes</strong></p>\n<p><em>&quot;A fond portrait of the mild-mannered Virginian and implacable advocate for the young American government....Historian and novelist Stewart offers a pertinent lesson on Madison's ability to forge working bonds with other founding members of the new American government, even if they did not always see eye to eye....Stewart's lively character sketches employ sprightly prose and impeccable research.&quot;-Kirkus Reviews</em></p>\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n<p>David O.
