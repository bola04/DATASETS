Any PeerStream owned services linked to other privacy policies are governed by that service’s privacy policy. PeerStream provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue to use the Services and the choices we offer for you to manage the information we collect related to the use of the Services.

For example, account information may include name, date of birth, email address, physical address, and mobile number. Profile information may include first name as the user name displayed to other users, gender, current city, interests, photos, ethnicity, age and any other information or photos you choose to provide in your profile.

         When using our Services and any applicable third party social networking services such as Facebook (a “Social Network”), you may have the option to consent to connecting your profile or activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you choose to use our Social Network populating feature to create an account, we may import information for your account or profile on our Services from a Social Network. We only import from the information you allow to be imported from the Social Network which is controlled by your privacy settings on that Social Network (“Permitted Social Network Content”). The authentication of your Social Network login credentials is conducted solely by the Social Network. If you use this feature we initially create your profile by displaying your first name as the user name displayed to other users, gender, current city, interests, about me, photos, and age (which is calculated from your birthdate). With your permission, we may also combine that information with your public social media profile (which may include your friend list, birthday, work history, interests, current city, photos, personal description and likes). Please review the Social Network’s privacy policy and choices for sharing information with our Services. By associating your Social Network account with our Services and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store Permitted Social Network Content across all our Services and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

         From time-to-time we may request information from you via surveys, contests or sweepstakes. Participation is completely voluntary. Information collected in any sweepstakes or contest may be used as set forth in this policy and as described in the official rules, such as to notify the winners, award prizes and file winners’ information, as required by law.

         The Services are designed to enable you to communicate with other users through interactive forums, and any information or content you post when participating in the Services or Social Networks becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by PeerStream and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting a profile or otherwise participating in such Services and we have no control over how users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information.  Although we use precautions to avoid having your profile information made publicly available through internet search crawlers, it is possible that your profile information may become available; we therefore encourage you not to disclose any information that you may not want to make public.

          tracking technologies

        </p>
        <p>
         Tracking Technologies are used for a variety of purposes, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Operationally Necessary.
          </strong>
         </li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <p>
         We may use Tracking Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve content offered through the Services. For example, we may use these tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information. We may also use Tracking Technologies to tell us, whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest. We may also collect information about the website you visited before you came to our Services and the website you visited after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied by your browser. We use Google to serve first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) to report how our ad impressions, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Services.

Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements to you on third-party websites and applications.

You have the ability to opt out of mobile-app targeted advertising ads from any or all of the listed participating advertising networks.  You can download the free mobile app from an app store available on your mobile platform.  When you opt out with a particular participating advertising network, the mobile app adds your device identifier to that participant’s opt-out list.  The participant advertising network is then notified to block the device identifiers on the opt-out list.

         You can also prevent your receipt of interest-based ads on websites by deleting and declining cookies in your browser(s). Note that your opt-out choice is applied only to the browser from which you make the choice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications. You can check the settings on your device for such options in your devices’ operating system. Alternatively, you may wish to download the TrustE mobile application and/or the Digital Alliance “App Choices” mobile application and follow the instructions provided.

         </strong>
         Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites and online services which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our users’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As such, we do not currently respond to these signals. Your mobile web browser may provide a “Do Not Track” browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest based ads.

         </strong>
         Information gathered from your use of the Services may be combined with information from third-party sources to identify your location by state and region (“Regional Location”). If you enable location services for our Services, we may passively collect regional location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services. Certain of our mobile applications have search functionality that gathers aggregate location data about visitors and when visitors opt-in, allows us to collect information about their precise geographic location (“Geo-location”). We may use GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell tower proximity to determine Geo-location. If you agree to have your Geo-location collected, we may use and retain that precise location data to provide you with information about our Services or carry out marketing and other activities contemplated by our mobile applications and by this Policy. When you have Geo-location software running on your Device, we may only collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings on your Device. For most mobile Devices, you are able to withdraw your permission for us to acquire this information on your location through the Device settings. If you have questions about how to disable your mobile Device’s location services, we recommend you contact your mobile Device service provider or the Device manufacturer.

           Cookies.
          </em>
         </strong>
         A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Services. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Services. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.

          <em>
           HTML5.
          </em>
         </strong>
         We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iPhone or iPad. HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile Device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.

          <em>
           Web Beacons/GIFS.
          </em>
         </strong>
         Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

         <strong>
          <em>
           Embedded Scripts.
          </em>
         </strong>
         An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device used to access Services from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

          </em>
         </strong>
         Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and Device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Services. We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or Device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our Services and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.

          <em>
           Device Fingerprinting.
          </em>
         </strong>
         We may use Device fingerprinting in some of our Services, which allows us to collect information about a remote computing Device for the purpose of identification. It can be used to prevent fraud or collect information about you.
        </p>

         <strong>
          <em>
           IDFA.
          </em>
         </strong>
         The IDFA is a Device identifier that is used by many software kit developers for various reasons including to measure user behavior in mobile apps. Additionally, the IDFA is the shared identifier between an ad network and an ad server to report which networks delivered a particular download.
