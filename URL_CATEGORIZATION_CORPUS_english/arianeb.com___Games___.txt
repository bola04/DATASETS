        <p>
         I mentioned in
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/2018/01/23/virtual-reality-vs-virtual-currency/">
          January’s blog post
         </a>
         that there has been a number of attempts to make VR more mainstream and there are a number of obstacles to overcome to get people there.  The biggest one being cost.  Then buried in the numerous stories regarding Facebook is the release of the cheapest ever entry point into VR:
         <a href="https://www.oculus.com/go/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          Oculus Go
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         For as cheap as $200, you can get a completely stand alone VR setup. No PC required, no expensive video card, and best of all no cables attached to your neck that prevent turning.  The only outside requirements are a smart phone or tablet to download the Oculus App so you can buy stuff, and a wifi connection so you can download stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know what you are thinking: “For that price there are probably limitations” and yes it is true.  Oculus Go is basically the equivalent of a Samsung Galaxy with
         <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          Gear VR
         </a>
         .  The library available for the Go is nearly the same as for Gear VR, but it has a stand alone wifi tablet built in instead of needing to attach your Samsung phone.
        </p>
        <p>
         More expensive VR setups are also more sophisticated.
         <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          HTC Vive
         </a>
         tracks its position with multiple cameras so you use your entire body to move around. Go only tracks your head and one hand with the controller in it.  I’m actually OK with this. Sophisticated VR setups require you to stand and move around to be useful with the added danger of running into stuff. With GO, I can experience most everything in a comfy office chair that swivels around.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another limitation is “cell phone graphics”.  The big graphics intensive VR games and platforms are probably not going to run on Go, and that is going to be a problem for the VR industry as a whole if Go becomes a thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lastly there is a problem with battery life. Expect only 2 to 3 hours per charge, or do what I do and get an extra long usb to micro usb cable and keep it connected. It will still drain battery, but slower. Lowering the brightness will help, too.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           The VR Experience
          </em>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         On the positive side, the VR you experience on this cheap device is very good. HD-VR pictures and videos look great, and most of the content available is in this category. Video games tend to be simplistic with low-res textures to keep the frame rates high — a requirement for real immersive VR. I’ve tried a few games, and they all avoid realistic graphics for this reason.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the low res look, playing a game that covers your entire field of view in 3D with a high frame rate is quite an amazing experience.

        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           The problem with new hardware: The software problem!
          </em>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         There is another limitation, but it is an artificial one that will eventually be overcome… maybe: Right now, your only source of software is the Oculus store, and right now the selection is a bit on the slim side.  The future of VR rests on sales of Oculus Go.  If it is finally the breakout VR hit the industry has been waiting for, all of those VR content creators who have been spending billions with little return to show for it, will need to get onto the Go.
        </p>
        <p>
         If on the other hand Go sales are as lame as Gear VR and Playstation VR sales were, the Oculus store will continue to struggle for content.
        </p>
        <p>
         And that’s the real question here. Awash in investor money, VR software development was big four years ago. Every one wanted to create the software for the next big thing, and that was supposed to be VR.
        </p>
        <p>
         Development money is drying up. Much of the content is one to two years old, and many of the VR videos come from companies like CNN that are no longer investing resources in
         <a href="https://www.cnn.com/vr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          VR videos
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus we have a vicious circle. For VR to go mainstream, Oculus Go needs to sell well, but for it to really sell well, there needs to be software or content that people want to play and use, but for that content to develop, Oculus Go needs to sell well.
        </p>

           A Look at the current content
          </em>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         So here are some mini reviews of the content I found available now:
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Epic Roller Coasters
         </em>
         – Probably the best way to demo VR is with a virtual roller coaster. Everyone knows this, which is why roller coaster videos and demos are pretty much everywhere. Epic Roller Coasters is the best of these, not only with the most interesting environments, but there is a physics game you can play where you must use a brake and accelerator to finish as quick as possible without crashing. Demo is free, $10 to unlock all of the coasters.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Bait
         </em>
         – Once you get tired of making yourself dizzy with roller coasters, you can go to the other extreme with a fishing simulator.  It’s actually kind of relaxing, but I got bored of the repetitive play in the demo and didn’t bother with the full version.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Rush
         </em>
         – This is a glider suit racing challenge.  This is a game that is perfect for VR, but suffers from the lack of realistic graphics. Gets repetitive after a while.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          They Suspect Nothing
         </em>
         – This is a series of mini arcade games packaged in a funny robot oriented theme that is very entertaining. As with many “mini arcade games” some are more fun than others, but there is less chance of boredom with more things to do.  I also tried
         <em>
          Wonderglade
         </em>
         which is another mini arcade game, it has a “magic school” theme clearly designed for kids.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Amaze VR
         </em>
         – A collection of about 200 videos, and because they are sorted by popularity the ones featuring beautiful models dancing, exotic dancing, and trying on bikinis in front of the camera are all near the top.  There is even the first chapter of a dating simulator, but unfortunately no second chapter.  Often the models in these videos are close enough to the camera that they feel like they are too close.  This is all PG stuff but it ironically demos the potential for VR porn.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Republique VR
         </em>
         – Finally a real story driven video game. It’s a stealth game where you try and lead a prisoner to safety. Often involves puzzles and what not.  Apparently this game started originally as a mobile game and was upgraded to VR. I only got started but so far it feels cool.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Oculus Gallery, Netflix VR, Hulu VR
         </em>
         – Ironically, one of the best uses for VR is the ability to watch good old 2D movies and TV in a virtual simulation of a theater or home living room. The lighting in the room even changes depending on the light from the screen.  Or you can just play it in a “void” and watch TV through the goggles while laying down comfortably so you don’t have to face the TV to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Oculus Rooms
         </em>
         – If any app would be a “killer app” (an app that would encourage others to get the product), it might be Oculus Rooms.  Oculus being a Facebook product, the focus is on meeting others virtually.
         <em>
          Oculus Rooms
         </em>
         allows multiple people to meet together virtually and engage in multiple mutual activities like watch TV and movies together, play a board game, or just hang out and chat.
        </p>
        <p>
         But is it a “killer app”? I have been doing these kinds of activities with others online for 15 years in Second Life and There.com, both of which are declining in use. This is also not the first VR type product like this
         <a href="https://altvr.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          AltspaceVR
         </a>
         (which is also available on GO) has been around a while and also struggling for users,
         <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40454268/social-vr-pioneer-altspace-says-it-isnt-shutting-its-doors-after-all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          almost shutting down
         </a>
         last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bottom line is that the current offerings on Go mostly feel like “gimmicks”. It is going to take a larger user base to start developing the platform into something people not only want but will use regularly.

         The battle for Net-Neutrality,
         <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16780564/net-neutrality-is-dead-what-happens-next" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          which despite of what you heard is still ongoing
         </a>
         , seems to have changed government regulators attitudes towards the internet on what they can and cannot regulate and censor.
        </p>

         <a href="https://arianeb.com/2014/11/14/the-conservative-case-for-net-neutrality/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          I knew this is where it would go

         .  As soon as you let Government change how the internet works, you open the doors to all sorts of shenanigans.  All those

          “Libertarians” who were saying that “Net Neutrality is government interference”

         even though I have been saying it is the exact opposite for years, well they can just go fuck off, because their ignorance is

         government interference.

         The wild west days of making money off the internet are very much numbered now.  The internet as it looks today will likely be a distant memory within 10 years, even if we somehow get Net Neutrality back.  Big changes are coming, some I might even agree with, but their ultimate effects are unknown.

         Slipped into the must pass budget was the CLOUD Act.  A piece of legislation actually supported by data collection companies, because it basically allows them to wash their hands of the whole issue:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          As we wrote before, the CLOUD Act is a far-reaching, privacy-upending piece of legislation that will:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Enable foreign police to collect and wiretap people’s communications from U.S. companies, without obtaining a U.S. warrant.
          </li>
          <li>
           Allow foreign nations to demand personal data stored in the United States, without prior review by a judge.
          </li>
          <li>
           Allow the U.S. president to enter “executive agreements” that empower police in foreign nations that have weaker privacy laws than the United States to seize data in the United States while ignoring U.S. privacy laws.
          </li>
          <li>
           Allow foreign police to collect someone’s data without notifying them about it.
          </li>
          <li>
           Empower U.S. police to grab any data, regardless if it’s a U.S. person’s or not, no matter where it is stored.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          And, as we wrote before, this is how the CLOUD Act could work in practice:
         </p>
         <p>
          London investigators want the private Slack messages of a Londoner they suspect of bank fraud. The London police could go directly to Slack, a U.S. company, to request and collect those messages. The London police would not necessarily need prior judicial review for this request. The London police would not be required to notify U.S. law enforcement about this request. The London police would not need a probable cause warrant for this collection.
         </p>
         <p>
          Predictably, in this request, the London police might also collect Slack messages written by U.S. persons communicating with the Londoner suspected of bank fraud. Those messages could be read, stored, and potentially shared, all without the U.S. person knowing about it. Those messages, if shared with U.S. law enforcement, could be used to criminally charge the U.S. person in a U.S. court, even though a warrant was never issued.
         </p>
        </blockquote>

         This basically allows police states to trace web activity of individuals all over the world. Bottom line,

         Lately, there has been a lot of action to stop sex trafficking.  Sex trafficking is basically organized forced rape of its victims, and unfortunately it is rather prevalent around the world.  Everyone should be against sex trafficking.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here is the cynical problems with this approach:  1. Somehow conservative politicians equate escort services with sex trafficking.  “Escorts” are in the profession by choice, can choose their clients, and reserve the right to say no.  They are not sex traffickers, no are they part of the sex trafficking industry, but they are low hanging fruit that lawmakers can exploit to say they are doing something about it.  This reduces resources to investigate and stop the

         Problem #2: This is a back handed way to implement SOPA.  SOPA in case you don’t remember was a mandate for websites to self police themselves. It would force websites to closely monitor all posts for copyright violations, and other illegal content. It would have effectively closed down major websites that allow user created content unless they hired thousands of people to monitor all content that goes on the site.  FOSTA forces websites to self monitor for sex trafficking.  Because of this

          Craigslist was forced to shut down the personals section

         of its website.  No big loss there as far as I am concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
         The problem is there are legitimate websites used by escorts to safely find clients that are likely to be affected and shut down, this will drive web traffic of this nature further underground and make the sex trafficking problem even worse.

         But a bigger fear is that law enforcement will use FOSTA as a way to regulate web traffic of all sorts, and once government’s foot is in the door on this, the next step is to break down the door.  How long before government goes after all porn in the name of stopping sex trafficking?

There is no porn on/off switch on the internet.  There exist VPN services designed to block content so that concerned parents can think their kids are safe online, but making everyone use these unless they pay a $20 fee with a picture ID and a written statement saying you want to watch porn, is downright fascist.

         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Combining Governments new concern for online privacy with the fiasco that targeted advertising created in 2016 with the Brexit vote in the UK and the Trump election in the US, “targeted advertising” via data collection is getting a bad reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been thinking for years that companies that advertise online probably are not getting as much out of it as they think.  Especially those clickbait sites that steal material from other sites, slightly rewrite it to avoid copyright, post it online saturated with ads, then buy ads on Facebook to get people to come to their ad saturated sites, and somehow turn a profit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Google and Facebook are two of the biggest companies in the world, and they pretty much make all their money on supposedly “targeted advertising”.  Companies looking to sell stuff buy ads on these platforms in hopes that they will be seen by people likely to be interested in their products.  Is the advertising working? Obviously it is working at least a little bit, or nobody would be making any money.
        </p>

         Here’s the problem: it’s not working as well as it used to.

         Sites that depend on online advertising for revenue are not doing as well as they used to. Even major sites like Twitter, Snapchat, Tumblr, and Reddit seem to have low profit margins if they make a profit at all.  They try to bolster those profits by adding more ads to their sites which of course just annoys readers.

        <p>
         Making money on You Tube got really big when word got out that some You Tube stars were making millions annually in ad revenue from the site.  This of course started a flood until newcomers were finding out that making original content videos was hard and only the most popular were making the big bucks.
        </p>
        <p>
         To make matters worse, advertisers on You Tube were upset to learn their ads were appearing on You Tube channels with controversial content. So

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of these channels launched Patreon pages which seeks financial help from viewers in the form of small monthly donations. This has helped small operators make money lost on declining advertising revenue.  There was a policy change on Patreon last December that threatened that as a source of revenue, but

         </p>

        <p>
         Over the past month, I have been debating on updating Ariane for her next game. The above was an early draft which I am NOT going to use as I will explain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like many in the 3D People Rendering Community, I am still torn between the Poser vs Daz Studio rift, which I previously catalogued
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/2015/06/24/how-victoria-7-is-killing-a-hobby/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          here

         , and
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/2016/02/20/the-3d-figure-community-everybody-hates-daz3d/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          here
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The last high quality DAZ figure with full Poser support was Victoria 4, which is now over a decade old.  Ancient by tech standards, and still widely supported with new clothes hair and accessories, because such things still sell well.
        </p>
        <p>
         But Victoria 4 still has some flaws that make it less desirable to use…

         I picked this Victoria 4 image to point out the main flaws: 1.) The armpits are way too high up the arm. 2.) the hip to thigh bend looks unnatural, as does the thigh to shin bend.  Finally, 3.) while there are literally hundreds of skin textures available, most do not support the latest renderers like DAZ’s iRay and Poser’s Superfly.
        </p>
        <p>
         The DAZ Studio solution is really easy: switch to G3 and G8 based figures (there are no G4 to G7 figures because: “reasons”) which DAZ is more than happy to sell you. Most of my fellow Dating Sim/Visual Novel makers have made the switch fairly successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Poser solution is not so easy. There are advanced models natively available to Poser, namely

         </a>
         that is even more advanced than G8 as far as versatility goes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The problem is that there is not a lot of support for these figures. Dawn has a fair amount, and Project Evolution may eventually, especially since it has backward compatibility with V4. But the majority of the support for new figures is not surprisingly for G3 and G8.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is possible to convert G3 and G8 figures to be used in Poser,
         <a href="https://www.renderosity.com/mod/freestuff/?item_id=76121" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          instructions can be found here
         </a>
         .  But because it is not supported natively, you have to convert every accessory the same way, and that could get time consuming, and the resulting Poser figures are memory hogs.  I briefly considered creating a new Ariane based on

           Attempts to make a Dawn version of Ariane
          </strong>
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         My initial idea was to try and make an “Ariane” using the Dawn figure. While the Dawn figure on the right has a more realistic body shape and curves, I could never get the face right. No matter what I did, the V4 face on the left is better looking and more realistic.

        <p>
         The truth is I ran into many of the same issues when
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/2011/08/18/ariane-gets-a-makeover/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          I converted V3 Ariane to V4 Ariane
         </a>
         , but ultimately
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/2013/04/15/whats-new-with-ariane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          V4 Ariane was a major improvement
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         This time, I am sticking with V4. The three problems with V4 mentioned above can be addressed by new products: 1.) The shoulders and other model issues can be fixed with
         <a href="https://www.renderosity.com/mod/bcs/perfect-v4-complete---full-body-fix/94928/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          “Perfect V4” by XandM
         </a>
         ,  2.) The bending problems can be fixed with products like
         <a href="https://www.renderosity.com/mod/bcs/i13-overhaul-for-v4/93054/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          “Overhaul for V4” by ironman13
         </a>
         .  I used these products extensively to create the
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/2017/07/02/date-ariane-graphics-update/">
          graphics update of Date Ariane
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The rendering skins can be updated with a python script
         <a href="https://www.renderosity.com/mod/bcs/d3d-perfect-skin-sss-lite/114499/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          “D3D Perfect Skin SSS Lite”
         </a>
         which will change a basic skin texture to simulate SSS effects in the Superfly renderer, and as a side bonus, the Superfly renderer renders even faster. (The only flaw is that it shows solid white skin in superfly preview mode, switch to firefly preview mode to see what the textures look like, then switch back to superfly mode before rendering.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is still the issue of the body shape looking better in Dawn than V4.  I solved that by using the rarely used Muscle Pack for V4. I originally got the muscle pack to make Wendy the Weightlifter look stronger, but adding a “toned” shape to Ariane at about 40%, I can give her the athletic curves I was looking for.

         Mortze, the graphic artists who does the work for the last 4 Elsa-verse games (see last post), release his own story in two parts last year. It is now complete and available for download. It is not available as an online game.

         The story is set on a science vessel called Pandora, hired to do underwater archaeology in a part of the ocean that is supposed to be where the legendary lost continent of Atlantis is.  You play a young male college student from Britain hired to do engineering work on the diving equipment.  The ship has a fairly large number of beautiful women on this voyage, too.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the cliche premise, the story is pretty good, and it is pretty linear.  While there are some additional scenes to unlock, there are no extra story branches to explore.

         My biggest concern is the illustration of the main love interest Maggie, the daughter of the ships captain.  They make it a point to say she is just out of high school, meaning she is most likely 17 or 18, therefore age appropriate, but the 3D model used to represent her (
         <a href="https://www.daz3d.com/teen-josie-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          Teen Josie form Daz3D

         ) makes her look around 13 or 14, which felt a little creepy at times.

        <p>
         Chaotics games continue to go with a traditional plot: get the girl, but each game has gotten more and more sophisticated. Leanna is the latest and most sophisticated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leanna is the host of a local news show. On screen she is friendly and likeable.  Off screen she is arrogant and self centered, and hard to get along with. Your job is to make her likeable before you and her appear on a game show together as a couple.

         The challenge is in what you say to her. Many times you are given responses. One of which will make her like you more, another make you like her less, and yet another (and these are the hard ones to figure out) will humble her and “break down the facade” she has built to push everyone away.  Advancement in the game requires you to both make her like you
         <em>
          and
         </em>
         lower her facade, which requires a balance to your responses.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a secondary story branch of trying to reunite Leanna with the original “friend” she was supposed to take on the game show before she abruptly quit.  I actually haven’t completed that one yet.

         I love the graphics in this game, Chaotic’s usual humor is here, and the game proved to be a bit of a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
         Added benefit: The latest version of this game allows you to play as a male or female, with different gender appropriate sex scenes depending on your choice.

         April and Violet is a Members Only game. It is an indirect sequel to

          Betsy
         </a>
         , a free game I reviewed before.  Betsy was a nice prim and proper conservative high school girl that wanted to be more open and confident. If you played that game, you met two other girls, the wild and crazy Violet, and the often mean but misunderstood April. The sub plot of that game (if you chose correctly) was for April and Violet to end up a couple (they are both bisexual).

         The sequel involves you driving to California, and needing a place to stay, you end up in a crappy roadside motel that April and Violet have also managed to find themselves staying at.  Weird twilight zone stuff happens like all of the gas disappearing from your cars, and hiking into the next town reveals a ghost town that recently was filled with people.

        <p>
         The solution to these mysteries is silly, and involves a chainsaw, but then this whole adventure plays like a stoner comedy where weed is replaced by casual sex and booze.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like many other Chaotic games, you can pick your gender, making it a crazy girl getaway, or play a male stuck in a hotel with three sex crazed girls.  Oddly, I found the female/female sex scenes to be better animated than the male/female ones.  There are also two skin tones to pick from.
        </p>
        <p>
         What did you think of these games? Got any suggestions for me to review?

          Tlaero and Mortze

         continue to up the game with their latest release
         <em>
          Saving Chloe
         </em>
         , which I believe is probably the best game of the genre ever, and sets the bar for the rest of us who work in this genre.  The story is excellent, the artwork is excellent, the 9 possible “good” endings all contain great erotic scenes, and oddly one of the most erotic scenes is in a “bad” ending, of which there are many.  So, lots of choices and lots of endings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Probably the only flaw of the game is that to really enjoy the story you need to have played 3 previous games

        <p>
         There are other odd things in the game.  Some of the points where stories branch are not very obvious.  This is not necessarily a flaw, I like making seemingly meaningless choices turn out to have big consequences as well, but when you are trying to find those last two endings, and not sure how to get there it can be frustrating, but I made it to all 9 “good” endings without cheating and found about 5 bad ones, too.

        <p>
         In Dreaming with Elsa, you play Jason a delivery guy with a recurring dream of chasing a woman. One day your delivery route changes and you deliver a shipment of books to a bookstore whose owner looks exactly like the woman you have been chasing in your dreams. She has also had a recurring dream of being chased by a man. Are you in each others dreams?
        </p>
        <p>
         Elsa is a shy introvert who lives above the store. She has one employee Chloe who coincidentally has an interest in dream interpretation. Chloe went to the store looking for a rare book called
         <em>
          Morpheus
         </em>
         which is a legendary book on dreams. Elsa said she did not have a copy, but in their discussion of the book, Chloe talked herself into working for Elsa.

        <p>
         Upon returning from the restaurant, Elsa invites Jason up to her room where she discovered, someone has been in her apartment. Elsa quickly checks her wall safe, and the only completely intact copy of
         <em>
          Morpheus
         </em>
         (which she had all along) is still there.
        </p>
        <p>
         The volume has been in her family for generations, and she was told never to read it, but she reads it to find out why everyone wants it so bad. It is a guidebook of “dream masters”. In it, Elsa learns to put people together in dreams, see into other’s dreams, and control dreams. With these powers she learns who it was who broke into her apartment: It was Chloe. Chloe, who also gained some dream powers from a few pages of a very incomplete copy, has been manipulating everything the entire way in order to get her hands on the full book.  Elsa fires her, and promising that if she catches Chloe in anyone else’s dreams, she will give Chloe nightmares for life.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the end credit scene of the latest version, we see a strange woman named Xara show up in a dream and ask Elsa if she is the new Dream Master, and that she needs someone with her abilities.

        <ul>
         <li>
          What was Chloe’s end game? Why did she need to be a dream master so bad?

          What is so special about Elsa and Chloe that they would have these powers to begin with?

         <em>
          Finding Miranda
         </em>
         ‘s main plot is an office romance between a systems engineer named Lucas (which you play), who recently lost his wife, and a beautiful and brilliant “problem solver” named Miranda.  For the purposes of backstory for
         <em>
          Saving Chloe
         </em>
         , the romance is immaterial, it’s the “b” story that is of interest.

         We meet Xara again, this time outside Elsa’s dream world.  She a short blind woman looking for revenge on a former boss named Morland.  He is rich and powerful, and like Elsa, seems to have a superpower, but we do not know what. Morland is protected by a goth female bodyguard named Crow who is a deadly killer with powers of illusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Xara isn’t helpless, she is trained in combat before she was blinded, and is basically a female version of
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics_character)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          <em>
           Daredevil
          </em>
         </a>
         .  She earns a living teaching self defense courses at a local gym.
        </p>
        <p>
         Xara can’t touch Morland, but starts recruiting “gifted” people that might be able to. Her first recruit is Miranda, who can solve complex problems in her head and come up with the best strategy rather quickly.  Miranda is also the childhood friend of Chloe, Morland’s daughter!

         Miranda and Chloe fell out about a year and a half ago, when Chloe caused an accident that left Miranda in a coma for a year. Chloe felt sorry and visited her old friend every day of the coma, but upon waking up Miranda refused to forgive her. Since the coma, Miranda has not been able to sleep again for the last 6 months.

         Xara also recruits dream master Elsa, of course, and manages a secret contact inside Morland’s operation who goes by the code name “YellowFever”.  This contact leaks information about Morland’s operation to shut down another super-powered woman named Jessica.

         Jessica’s super power is that she can affect people’s emotions by singing.  Sing fun songs, everyone has fun, sing sad songs, everyone is sad, etc.  Jessica is the lead singer in a rock band that is gaining popularity, mostly because she sings fun songs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Xara and Miranda work out that Morland plans to disable Jessica by getting her to sing angry by making her angry before a concert, then start a riot at the concert. Unfortunately, Xara is too late to stop it from happening.  Five people are killed in the ensuing riot.

         This is where Redemption for Jessika starts (her real name is Jessica Springfield, but “Jessika with a K” is her stage name).  You play Marc (with a “c”), a court stenographer who, being a big fan of
         <em>
          Mayhem
         </em>
         (Jessica’s band) was at the concert when the riot started, by happenstance you were also in the court during the hearing to determine if Jessica might have been at fault for the riot.  Jessica has become a drunk mess ever since the incident that left 5 people dead.  The plot of the game is to get Jessica to wake up from her drunken stupor and go back to singing again. Standing in your way is Chloe, who attempts to sabotage your efforts at every step.
        </p>
        <p>
         Along the way, you learn that Charles, Jessica’s former boyfriend, is the one that made her angry, and that he purposely started the riot. The story ends with you and Jessica stopping a bombing at a political rally that was set by Charles.
        </p>
        <p>
         Later, back in
         <em>
          Finding Miranda
         </em>
         , Xara, Elsa, and Miranda learn that Chloe is planning on attacking Jessica again at a concert to prevent her from stopping the bombing, but Miranda kidnaps Chloe to stop her and keeps her drugged for three days until Lucas convinces Miranda it is wrong to keep her that way. Chloe wakes up and she and Miranda have a fierce argument.  Ultimately Miranda feels sorry for the way Chloe is abused by her father Morland, and lets her go.

         In the epilogue of Finding Miranda, Chloe goes into hiding from her father.  After failing in both operation Elsa and Jessika, she is likely to be severely punished, maybe even killed. In a secret safe house, she grabs her laptop, signs into a secret message board as “YellowFever” and posts that she can no longer help from the inside anymore.

         If you play the game and are missing an ending or two, I wrote a guide to how to reach the 10 endings (9 good, 1 major bad).

          Here is a link to my chart.

         This is not a complete guide, there are some bad choice traps you will have to avoid yourself. These are just to point you in the right direction.

         Or not! There are plenty of reasons why VR has not become mainstream. The biggest is the bulky helmets you have to wear, and that most people experience dizzyness or nausea after only about 20 minutes of use. There is a great fix for this last issue that hasn’t been implemented enough:
         <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/reduce-vr-sickness-just-add-virtual-nose/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          Virtual noses
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         But, the biggest challenge to VR mainstream continues to be cost. You can spend $900 for a Samsung Galaxy 8 and Samsung VR headset, or you can spend about the same amount for a Playstation 4 and a Playstation VR bundle. If you want to do VR on your PC, you need around $1400.  That’s $400 for recently reduced price the Oculus Rift, and a $1000 required video card.

         <em>
          <strong>
           When did it cost $1000 for a video card?
          </strong>
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Why are video cards so expensive? One word:
         <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/nvidia-tells-retailers-to-sell-to-gamers-not-cryptominers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          <em>
           “Bitcoin”
          </em>
         </a>
         .  Virtual currencies like
         <em>
          Bitcoin
         </em>
         have skyrocketed in price over the last year, so much that it is worth building your own computer to “mine” number combinations that
         <a href="http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          fit the fairly simple formula
         </a>
         required to create a new Bitcoin (and if you find a combo, you get to keep it). Regular PC processors are not powerful enough to efficiently “mine”, but graphics cards are.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to sources, one graphics card can “mine” around $5 to $10 worth of virtual currency a day, though the
         <a href="http://whattomine.com/coins" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          best strategy is concentrate on the small lesser known currencies
         </a>
         , as too many other resources are being used to mine the expensive ones. This means your $1000 graphics card will pay for itself in about 4 months, assuming prices stay high enough. But before you invest, consider that you will need a 500W power supply that has to run 24 hours a day, so expect to lose on your electricity bills, too.
        </p>
        <p>
         The recent trend is that virtual currencies are declining in value, losing half their value in the last two months. If it continues to decline, you won’t make enough to pay for the electricity. Maybe then video cards will come down in price.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          <strong>
           My prediction: Both will fail
          </strong>
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite being friends with both VR pioneers and crypto currency advocates, I have to take the rational position that they are both doomed to fail.  VR is the next Kinect, WiiU, 3D TV, or many other trendy “cool” techs that ultimately failed.  Crypto-currencies are riding a bubble like
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          “Tulip Mania”
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Advocates of both will insist that they have heard these criticisms before, and my answer is “because they are valid”.
        </p>
        <p>
         I might invest in VR gear if the price comes down to a decent level. In the mean time, I’m using my graphics card for gaming and 3D rendering.

         It was over two years ago when I released a story involving “Date Ariane” star Ariane meeting “Something’s In The Air” star Rachel meeting each other by chance at a Halloween party.  Parts 2, 3, and the first draft of part 4 were released last winter when I had a lot of time on my hands. After today, I am finished with part 5.

         OK, Spoilers.
        </p>
        <p>
         So Ariane really isn’t gay, and Rachel is asexual.  I more or less already revealed this a year ago in the badly written draft of part 4 I released last February.  I had some anonymous bartender break the news in a very awkwardly written scene that might exist somewhere, but I removed it from my web sites.
        </p>
        <p>
         I spent the good part of this last year trying to rewrite part 4, and failing miserably.  My second approach was to make a game of this story and have the part 4 top club divide into three paths: one with the ending as it currently exists, one where Rachel and Ariane have sex, and one with the “Rachel is Asexual” reveal, but before I could illustrate it, I made a valiant attempt at writing it and completely failing.

         The problem is that a perfect stranger they meet at a sex club should not be breaking the news, even though it makes sense that there would be a lot of sex experts at a sex club.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fix I came up with is 1.) for the three branches at the sex club to be one long branch, and 2.) to have Lydia make the reveal. It is much better with someone they know breaking the news.  There is a bonus reason 3.) The story comes full circle as part 5 chapter 3 feels like a repeat of
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/rachel-dates-ariane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          part 2
         </a>
         .  The last few pictures are even the same except the different hair styles.

         At the end of
         <a href="https://arianeb.com/rachel-dates-ariane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          part 2
         </a>
         , Ariane reveals she sucks at relationships, and Rachel reveals that she has an odd fetish when it comes to sex — she can’t be herself, she role plays. Part 5 closes both of those story arcs with Ariane finally finding a successful relationship, and Rachel finally being herself in an intimate moment.

        <p>
         When I first designed the Rachel character I wanted her to be different than Ariane.  Two traits I originally imagined for Ariane, being a science geek and a secret supermodel, never came to fruition, so I gave those traits to Rachel.  I also got a comment once from a vegetarian player of Date Ariane, wondering why she was such a big meat eater, the comment inspired me to make Rachel a vegetarian.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the biggest trait of Ariane is that she is
         <em>
          really
         </em>
         into sex, often on the first date.
        </p>
        <p>
         So my original formulation of Rachel was to make her
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         really into sex, especially on the first date.  So the stories I came up with in
         <em>
          Something’s In The Air
         </em>
         didn’t involve sex. There was nudity at the dress shop and at her private photo studio, and at the house party though she didn’t get naked herself.
        </p>
        <p>
         The problem, as all my beta testers informed me, is that erotic visual novels should have erotic scenes with the main characters. So I came up with this weird but geeky work around that Rachel will have sex when she pretends to be someone else. So I wrote two sex scenes with Rachel involving this quirk.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
         I later found out in my research on sexual fetishes, that there are people that fantasize about sex not involving themselves, and it is called
         <a href="http://asexuals.wikia.com/wiki/Autochorissexual" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          autochorissexuality
         </a>
         , and it is a sub category of asexuality.  Asexuals are not sexually attracted to anyone, but still may have a sex drive that can be triggered with the right stimulus. That is a pretty good description of Rachel’s quirk.  So Rachel has been asexual since I created her.
        </p>
        <p>
         Part of the reason I needed to reveal this fact in this story is because asexual representation is rare in the media. It is estimated that Asexuals represent somewhere between 1% to 2% of the population, which makes them a pretty small minority.
         <a href="https://www.glaad.org/blog/glaads-where-we-are-tv-report-highlights-why-representationmatters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          GLAAD points out
         </a>
         that there are literally only 2 asexuals on TV.  Todd on
         <em>
          Bojack Horseman
         </em>
         is the most prominent, Raphael on
         <em>
          Shadowhunters
         </em>
         is a minor recurring asexual vampire. That’s it.

           Is this really The End for this story?
          </strong>
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         There is an epilogue to the story that I attempted to include in the last part, but it interrupted the tone of the story so I dropped it:
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          On January 2nd, Ariane goes back to work after her week vacation to face a stack of new bug reports to sort and file, while Rachel has a morning meeting with her agent to discuss the new contacts and job offers she got on New Years Eve.  Rachel is super busy with jobs and online classes for the next several months.  The two of them rarely see much of each other after the new year.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         This could set up a “Part 6” in the future, or it could set up a future game. I really haven’t decided yet.
