        A Message from Kate...
       </h1>
       <p>
        Hello and thank you for visiting my web site. I hope youll find all you want to know about me, my books, and the new titles and events I have coming up.
       </p>
       <p>
        If new titles are what you're looking for, then check out the details of  my latest books on the
        <a href="uk.html">
         UK Books page
        </a>
        or the
        <a href="usa.html">
         USA Books page
        </a>
        . Older books are all listed on the
        <a href="backlist.html">
         Backlist page
        </a>
        , where you will also find which books are connected to the others so that if you're looking for a complete series, you'll know exactly which titles to hunt for.  I'm just completing my 65th title, so if you're new to my site, there's plenty to go at! And if you've visited before — then welcome back! You'll find my most up to date titles listed here — and if you want all the  most recent news, then check out
        <a href="http://kate-walker.blogspot.com/">
         my blog page
        </a>
        which is where all the latest news can be found.
       </p>
       <p>
        December 2014 marked the 30th anniversary of the date when my very first book ever —
        <a href="http://www.kate-walker.com/books/the-chalk-line.html">
         The Chalk Line
        </a>
        — was published.  That was the start of a wonderful new career.  Now I'm looking forward to seeing my 64th title in print in December 2015 —
        <a href="/books/destined-for-the-desert-king.html">
         Destined for the Desert King
        </a>
        . This book connects up with the earlier book —
        <a href="/books/a-question-of-honor.html">
         A Question of Honour
        </a>
        — and it tells the story of Nabil, the bridegroom Clemmie was supposed to have married if she hadn't met Karim.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year I had the excitement of revising and republishing my award-winning how to write guide —
        <a href="http://www.kate-walker.com/books/12-point-guide.html">
         Kate Walker's 12 Point Guide To Writing Romance
        </a>
        . Of course this has been on sale for some years now and I've lost count of the number of people who have written to me to say how much it has helped them on the road towards publication as a romance novelist. But the previous editions had really unsatisfactory distribution and the paperback edition was way too expensive for many people. So I revised and updated the book — and relaunched a new ebook edition on Kindle. This is now available on Amazon — for only $3.99 ( £2.86 ). It also has a fabulous new cover design — take a look at my For Writers page to see it. I'm really hoping that a lot more people will be helped by this book as they set out on their road towards publication.  I've also launched a new paperback edition which is easily available (For details see
        <a href="writers.html">
         Writers page
        </a>
        .)
       </p>
       <p>
        And talking about learning more about writing romantic fiction, if you live in the UK, I've been asked to run more courses through the coming year. So far, every course that has been planned has been fully booked and the ones coming up are already getting close to full. I've put on extra dates and courses as much as I can but I don't have more time to spare for more teaching — I have to write my own books!  But if you live in the UK or are visiting at any time when you could come on one of my courses, take a look at the Events page where you'll see what's coming up. If you'd like to book a place I suggest you get your name down soon — particularly for the Advance Romance Writing Course in Fishguard in February. One event that was a real success was my special Focus on Writing Romance retreat — this was so popular that I've been asked to run more. For full details and where to book — check out the
        <a href="events.html">
         Events page
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        And maybe I'll see you at one of these courses later in the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the meantime, I hope you are all enjoying life with the love of family friends to warm your days — and plenty of great books to relax you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Happy Reading!
