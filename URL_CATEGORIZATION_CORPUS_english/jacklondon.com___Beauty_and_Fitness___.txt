      Jack London, whose life symbolized
 the power of will, was the most successful writer in America in the early 20th
 Century. His vigorous stories of men and animals against the environment, and
 survival against hardships were drawn mainly from his own experience. An
 illegitimate child, London passed his childhood in poverty in the Oakland slums.
 At the age of 17, he ventured to sea on a sealing ship. The turning point of his
 life was a thirty-day imprisonment that was so degrading it made him decide to
 turn to education and pursue a career in writing. His years in the Klondike
 searching for gold left their mark in his best short stories; among them, The
 Call of the Wild, and White Fang. His best novel, The Sea-Wolf, was based on his
 experiences at sea. His work embraced the concepts of unconfined individualism
 and Darwinism in its exploration of the laws of nature. He retired to his ranch
 near Sonoma, where he died at age 40 of various diseases and drug treatments.
