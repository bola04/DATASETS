For many players, a reduction in the intensity or frequency of high-impact activities will be sufficient for reducing inflammation and relieving pain. Rest, icing, compression, and elevation, as well as anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy, are also effective for treating early-stage tendonitis.

My anxiety was in high gear now.&nbsp;I needed an major surgery that involved going through the front and back of my neck to fix what silent damage had already been done.&nbsp;I remembered a family friend who had an extensive surgery with Dr. Vaccaro about 20 years prior and then more recently a high school friend who had a less invasive neck surgery with him recently.&nbsp;I then made my appointment with Dr. Vaccaro and never looked back.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To say I was scared to have this surgery is an understatement. In fact, I almost refused to have it because of my fear of it all.&nbsp;At one of my pre-op visits with the cardiologist, the Dr. told me that anyone can be a surgeon, but that Dr. Vaccaro has a gift with his hands. That sealed that deal for me.&nbsp;Dr. Vaccaro and Mila, his PA, walked me through every step and answered my 6,000 questions without hesitation. I had such fantastic care from the entire team.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am now 6 months post op and can\u2019t wait to see what the next 6 months bring.<\/p>"},"sto_block_size":{"id":"168","label":"Story Block Size","value":["2"],"display":"2"},"created":{"id":"2","label":"Created","value":"2018-04-04 19:54:28","display":"Wednesday, 04 April 2018\r\n\t\t<meta itemprop=\"dateCreated\" content=\"2018-04-04 19:54:28\">\r\n\t"},"document_type":{"id":"8","label":"Document type","value":"Ambassador Story","display":"Ambassador Story"},"sticky_date":{"id":"241","label":"Sticky Date","value":null,"display":""}},{"id":"3052","url":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/stories\/news-and-blog\/guy-lee-m-d-in-dominican-republic-as-part-of-the-abington-global-health-mission","image":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/s_guy_lee_banner-1.jpg","title":"Guy Lee, M.D., in Dominican Republic as part of the Abington Global Health Mission","date":"03 April 2018","main_video":{"id":"89","label":"Main Video","value":null,"display":""},"main_image":{"id":"67","label":"Main Image","value":[{"originalname":"guy_lee_banner-1.jpg","existingname":"","alt":"","title":"","desc":""}],"display":"<img src=\"\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/l_guy_lee_banner-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"fc_field_image\" itemprop=\"image\"\/>"},"text":{"id":"1","label":"Article Content *","value":"<p>Last month Rothman Institute Spine Surgeon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/physicians\/guy-a-lee-md\">Dr. Guy Lee<\/a> travelled to the Dominican Republic as part of the Abington Global Health Mission.

And, as the doctors at Rothman Institute know first-hand, wintertime likewise brings a wide spectrum of winter sports injuries, from lacerations to broken bones.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One particular injury that is common among participants of certain winter sports is elbow dislocation. Elbow dislocations can range greatly in terms of causation and of severity. At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Rothman Institute<\/a>, it is our goal to help inform winter sports athletes about the risk of injury so that such injuries may be prevented. If you do experience an elbow dislocation, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/specialties\/shoulder-and-elbow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Shoulder and Elbow experts at Rothman Institute<\/a> can offer you the best available treatment options.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about causes, diagnosis, and treatment of elbow dislocations, continue reading below.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Causes of Elbow Dislocation Injuries<\/b><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An elbow dislocation occurs when the elbow's joint surfaces are hyperextended or forced to separate, dislocating the elbow from the joint.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orthoinfo.aaos.org\/topic.cfm?topic=A00029\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The most common cause of an elbow dislocation is a traumatic, forceful impact<\/a>. Ordinarily, the elbow is held in place by the network of ligaments and muscles that connect with the bone surface. This type of traumatic impact, however, can push and rotate on the elbow, often resulting in it being destabilized.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elbow dislocations often occur when a slip, trip, or fall is braced with outstretched hands. For this reason, these injuries are common among upright winter sports that are prone to falls, such as skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating. Tobogganing and sledding are likewise common culprits, due to the tendency of riders to brace for impact using their outstretched hands during an accident.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Diagnosing Dislocated Elbows<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dislocated elbows are emergency injuries that demand immediate treatment. After an injury occurs, undergoing an examination for proper diagnosis and subsequent treatment is essential. Injured persons must not attempt to reset their elbows independently; professional medical care is needed to avoid doing further damage or elbow dislocation complications.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of your examination, you will undergo physical and visual tests (including x-rays), to assess the extent of damage and the degree dislocation. Using these tests, your physician will be able to determine if you have experienced a complete or partial dislocation. Your diagnosis will likewise assess whether the dislocation is simple (no major bone injuries), complex (associated bone and ligament injuries), or severe (bone damage, blood vessel and nerve damage).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proper, informed diagnosis will ensure that you receive effective treatment that is suited to the particular conditions of your injury.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Effective Treatments for Dislocations<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Elbow dislocation treatment depends greatly upon the type and severity of the injury; how to fix a dislocated elbow will depend upon the specific conditions of your elbow dislocation and general orthopaedic health.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For less serious (partial or simple) dislocations, normal alignment can be manually achieved. The patient will either be given pain killers or sedated; then, the reduction maneuver is gently performed to return the elbow to its proper location within the joint.

And, as the doctors at Rothman Institute know first-hand, wintertime likewise brings a wide spectrum of winter sports injuries, from lacerations to broken bones.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One particular injury that is common among participants of certain winter sports is elbow dislocation. Elbow dislocations can range greatly in terms of causation and of severity. At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/about-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Rothman Institute<\/a>, it is our goal to help inform winter sports athletes about the risk of injury so that such injuries may be prevented. If you do experience an elbow dislocation, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/specialties\/shoulder-and-elbow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Shoulder and Elbow experts at Rothman Institute<\/a> can offer you the best available treatment options.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about causes, diagnosis, and treatment of elbow dislocations, continue reading below.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Causes of Elbow Dislocation Injuries<\/b><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An elbow dislocation occurs when the elbow's joint surfaces are hyperextended or forced to separate, dislocating the elbow from the joint.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orthoinfo.aaos.org\/topic.cfm?topic=A00029\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The most common cause of an elbow dislocation is a traumatic, forceful impact<\/a>. Ordinarily, the elbow is held in place by the network of ligaments and muscles that connect with the bone surface. This type of traumatic impact, however, can push and rotate on the elbow, often resulting in it being destabilized.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elbow dislocations often occur when a slip, trip, or fall is braced with outstretched hands. For this reason, these injuries are common among upright winter sports that are prone to falls, such as skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating. Tobogganing and sledding are likewise common culprits, due to the tendency of riders to brace for impact using their outstretched hands during an accident.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Diagnosing Dislocated Elbows<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dislocated elbows are emergency injuries that demand immediate treatment. After an injury occurs, undergoing an examination for proper diagnosis and subsequent treatment is essential. Injured persons must not attempt to reset their elbows independently; professional medical care is needed to avoid doing further damage or elbow dislocation complications.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of your examination, you will undergo physical and visual tests (including x-rays), to assess the extent of damage and the degree dislocation. Using these tests, your physician will be able to determine if you have experienced a complete or partial dislocation. Your diagnosis will likewise assess whether the dislocation is simple (no major bone injuries), complex (associated bone and ligament injuries), or severe (bone damage, blood vessel and nerve damage).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proper, informed diagnosis will ensure that you receive effective treatment that is suited to the particular conditions of your injury.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Effective Treatments for Dislocations<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Elbow dislocation treatment depends greatly upon the type and severity of the injury; how to fix a dislocated elbow will depend upon the specific conditions of your elbow dislocation and general orthopaedic health.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For less serious (partial or simple) dislocations, normal alignment can be manually achieved. The patient will either be given pain killers or sedated; then, the reduction maneuver is gently performed to return the elbow to its proper location within the joint. The elbow will then be kept in a sling or splint and treated with physical therapy and elbow exercises.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of complex and severe dislocations, surgery may be recommended in order to properly fix misaligned bones and damaged ligaments; if nerves and blood vessels are damaged, they too will require surgical repair. Following reconstructive surgery, the elbow may be stabilized using an external hinge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>An elbow dislocation is a serious injury that is common among winter sports athletes and participants; it merits quality, effective treatment.

Since surgery, I have made a full&nbsp;recovery returning to the sport I love and even squatting and lifting more weight than I had prior to&nbsp;injury. My knee feels great and I have Dr. Freedman, Shawna, and the staff at Rothman Institute to thank for the&nbsp;wonderful job they did.<\/p>"},"sto_block_size":{"id":"168","label":"Story Block Size","value":["2"],"display":"2"},"created":{"id":"2","label":"Created","value":"2018-02-06 18:24:19","display":"Tuesday, 06 February 2018\r\n\t\t<meta itemprop=\"dateCreated\" content=\"2018-02-06 18:24:19\">\r\n\t"},"document_type":{"id":"8","label":"Document type","value":"Ambassador Story","display":"Ambassador Story"},"sticky_date":{"id":"241","label":"Sticky Date","value":null,"display":""}},{"id":"2925","url":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/stories\/news-and-blog\/distal-radial-fracture-treatment-in-trenton","image":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/s_blog_distal-fractures_2-18.png","title":"Three Recommended Types of Distal Radial Fracture Treatment In Trenton","date":"01 February 2018","main_video":{"id":"89","label":"Main Video","value":null,"display":""},"main_image":{"id":"67","label":"Main Image","value":[{"originalname":"blog_distal-fractures_2-18.png","existingname":"","alt":"distal radial fracture treatment in trenton","title":"","desc":""}],"display":"<img src=\"\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/l_blog_distal-fractures_2-18.png\" alt=\"distal radial fracture treatment in trenton\" class=\"fc_field_image\" itemprop=\"image\"\/>"},"text":{"id":"1","label":"Article Content *","value":"<h2><meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-4969cec3-523c-a58a-a6d4-e4bee032aae8\">Trenton Orthopaedic Group offers superior treatments for wrist fractures.<\/b><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s instinctual: when you experience a slip, trip, or fall, our natural impulse is to brace the fall with outstretched arms.
