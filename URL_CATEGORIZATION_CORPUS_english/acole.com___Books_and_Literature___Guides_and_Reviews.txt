         Inspired by Omar Khayyam’s “Rubaiyat,” as well as the life and times of

 		a village lad – the son of a potter - who  rises to become chief wizard

 		friend and brother, Safar must battle the darkest magic and a growing 
 		world-wide disaster to save all he holds precious. As side note: I first 
 		discovered the Rubaiyat Of Omar Khayyam at a market stall when I was a 
 		boy in Cyprus at a time when the island looked very much like Safar’s

         THE FAR KINGDOMS:

       </b>
       <font size="4">
        This 
 		critically acclaimed quartette was considered one of the best fantasy 
 		series of the 90’s. Two of the four books were finalists in World 
 		SF/Fantasy competitions. All four of the covers – by Tom Kidd – were 
 		winners of the World SF/Fantasy cover art competition. The novels were 
 		inspired by the sagas of history’s great explorers who returned home 
 		recounting the many wonders they encountered, a few of which were even 
 		true. Of particular note to us was Sir Richard Burton – not the actor, 
 		but the great 19th Century explorer who traced the source of the Nile 
 		and translated the Arabian Nights. Some critics have even waxed poetic 
 		in their praise of the Far Kingdoms novels, saying that if Scheherazade 
 		had gone on after her thousand and one tales, that these four stories 
 		would sure be among them. See for yourself while reading the sample

         FREEDOM BIRD:

       </b>
       <font size="4">
        During the 
 		Vietnam War, GI’s who managed to survive their tour of duty were flown 
 		home in chartered airliners they dubbed “Freedom Birds.” This “lost” 
 		Bunch &amp; Cole novel tells the tale of three young men, from wildly 
 		different backgrounds, who meet on such a plane. They make a pact to 
 		spend three days together partying it down in San Francisco – before 
 		heading home to civilian lives. But they get more than they bargained 
 		for, because when they land it July 1967, a time that would come to be 
 		known as the “Summer Of Love.” It’s a place and time where each young 
 		man will have to confront the ghosts who followed him home from the 
 		jungles of Vietnam and contemplate a future none had imagined. In the 
 		opening chapter you will find a scene very much like the one my writing 
 		partner, the late Chris Bunch, experienced when he flew home from 
 		Vietnam on his own “Freedom Bird.” It was that conversation, related to 
 		me years ago, that inspired the novel. You will see what I mean when you

         A RECKONING FOR KINGS - A Novel Of Vietnam:
        </font>
       </b>
       <font size="4">
        Set during the Tet Offensive of 1968, "Reckoning" tells the tale of one 
 		of America’s most crucial battles. It was during Tet that America won 
 		the battle, lost the war. For the first - and only - time in fiction, 
 		"Reckoning" tells the tale from both points of view. The book 
 		deliberately invites the reader to make up his or her own about the war. 
 		There are thirty major characters portrayed in "Reckoning" - a novel 
 		that took three full years to complete. Fifteen of the characters are 
 		American, the others are America's enemies - North Vietnamese, or Viet 
 		Cong.. The link between friend and foe is their relative youth. Wars are 
 		fought by young men and women, in their teens or their early twenties. 
 		Chris and I hoped readers would focus on the plight of the young 
 		soldiers, sent out to work the will of old men who stayed well out of 
 		harm’s way . Read the

        The

 		to “Reckoning,” and was inspired by the hero of that book – Dennis

       <font size="4">
        Young Patrick Shannon is the heir-apparent to the Shannon fortune, but 
 		murder and betrayal at a family gathering send him fleeing into the 
 		American frontier, with only the last words of a wise old woman to arm 
 		him against what would come. And when the Civil War erupts he finds 
 		himself fighting on the opposite side of those he loves the most. In The 
 		Wars Of The Shannons we see the conflict, both on the battlefield and 
 		the homefront, through the eyes of Patrick and the other members of his 
 		extended Irish-American family as they struggle to survive the conflict 
 		that ripped the new nation apart, and yet, offered a dim beacon of hope. 
 		This long awaited sequel to “Daughter” fell by the wayside over the 
 		years and has only just been rescued from the back of the closet. For a 
 		sample of a novel that took Chris and I over two years to research and

         LUCKY IN CYPRUS - A True Story About A Boy, A Teacher, 
 		An Earthquake, Some Terrorists And The CIA:
        </font>
       </b>
       <font size="4">
        LUCKY IN CYPRUS is a coming-of-age story set in the Middle East during 
 		the height of the Cold War. An American teenager - son of a CIA 
 		operative - is inspired by grand events and a Greek Cypriot teacher to 
 		learn about survival and his art. He witnesses earthquakes and riots and 
 		terrorist attacks, but in the end it is his teacher's gentle lessons 
 		that keep him whole. Based on my life as a CIA brat, Lucky In Cyprus has 
 		won many accolades: "Bravo, Allan! When I finished Lucky In Cyprus I 
 		wept." - Julie Mitchell, Hot Springs, Texas; "Lucky In Cyprus brought 
 		back many memories of those days. A wonderful book. So many shadows 
 		blown away!" - Freddy &amp; Maureen Smart, Episkopi, Cyprus. "... (Reading) 
 		Lucky In Cyprus has been a humbling, haunting, sobering and enlightening 
 		experience..." - J.A. Locke, Bookloons.com. To read the sample chapters,

       <font size="4">
        In 
 		the depths of the Sixties and The Days Of Rage, a young newsman, 
 		accompanied by his pregnant wife and orphaned teenage brother, creates a 
 		Paradise of sorts in a sprawling Venice Beach community of apartments, 
 		populated by students, artists, budding scientists and engineers 
 		lifeguards, poets and bikers as well as a few junkies thrown in for good 
 		measure. The inhabitants came to call the place “Pepperland,” after the 
 		Beatles movie, “Yellow Submarine.” Threatening this paradise is The Blue 
 		Meanie, a crazy giant of a man so frightening that he eventually even 
 		scares himself. Like Lucky In Cyprus, this is another autobiographical 
 		journey. With hell-hounds on my heels I fled to the relative safety of a 
 		mysterious land, whose inhabitants reached out and embraced me. Check

         A COP’S LIFE:

       <font size="4">
        Christmas, 1953: 
 		While the rest of Philadelphia sings “Jingle Bells,” Thomas Grubb gets 
 		his first taste of a cop’s life. Before he cashes his first paycheck he 
 		encounters: A man gutted by a knife-wielding mugger; A fighting-mad 
 		“mental case” intent on destroying a hospital emergency room; The 
 		hushed-up shooting death of an undercover cop. That initial week is 
 		nothing compared to what lies ahead. Working as a street cop, an 
 		undercover officer, a detective and finally gang control, Grubb will 
 		spend the next thirty years going toe-to-toe with all the fast-changing 
 		and sometimes violent events that have rocked American society. A Cop’s 
 		Life: The remarkable story of a truly remarkable man. I wrote this book 
 		with my late uncle, Thomas Grubb, and it was greeted with many 
 		accolades, including the most valuable of all, his fellow police 
 		officers. Here are just a few: "'A Cop's Life'" is a must read by anyone 
 		who ever wore the uniform or badge!" - Robert V. Eddie, Recording 
 		Secretary Philadelphia Lodge #5 Fraternal Order of Police; "If you like 
 		the inside story, if you like dealing with facts and not fluff, then you 
 		will love reading 'A Cop's Life!'"- Michael G. Lutz, President, 
 		Pennsylvania Fraternal Order of Police; "I thoroughly enjoyed 'A Cop's 
 		Life.'" It was both witty and right on target." - Bill Pawley Inspector, 
 		Retired, Philadelphia Police. Check out the

        Lost In 
 		Paradise: Ellen thought she'd hit bottom when her lover left her and the

 		hoped to start a new life and career in Boca Raton, Florida. But there 
 		she finds that her mother is in the throes of Alzheimer's and her 
 		powerful attorney brother is squeezing her small inheritance dry. When 
 		she tries to fight back, she strays into the web of one of the nastiest 
 		villains to step out of the hellfires. With death and humiliation 
 		staring her in the face and no one to help her, Ellen has to call upon 
 		resources she's never tapped before to save herself and her mother. This 
 		is the first book in what I call my “Boca Cycle” and my first attempt at 
 		a mystery/suspense novel. Of course, I’d written literally scores of 
 		such things in Hollywood, but never in novel form. I was gratified that

        Addison Mizner 
 		Flagler Titus Broward MacGregor has roots buried deep in Florida soil, 
 		and given his choice he'd spend his days enjoying the sand and surf and 
 		the pleasures of Boca Raton. Unfortunately, too many years on the dark 
 		side as a CIA operative have given him a need to help when no one else 
 		will. When his housekeeper's granddaughter is kidnapped, it's a given 
 		that Mac will step in. Before too long he's a target for a pair of 
 		ruthless, if somewhat clumsy, killers whose one assignment is to make 
 		sure he doesn't live long enough to discover a secret plan, condoned by 
 		the CIA, to use kidnapped children as bribes to gain the cooperation of 
 		third-world dictators. Time is running out as Mac enlists the help of 
 		his frog-obsessed scientist cousin, Mad Albert, to track down the 
 		kidnapper's lair before the children are shipped offshore to a fate 
 		straight out of a horror movie. This is the second book in “The Boca 
 		Cycle” and I had so much fun with it, I’m considering writing another 
 		starring the same character. Read the

        THE HATE PARALLAX, by 
 		Allan Cole and Russian Fantasy Master Nick Perumov, is getting a new 
 		lease on life on American shores, thanks to Wildside Books. A best 
 		seller in Europe and Russia, the book languished here under its old 
 		title: Lords Of Terror. Nick and I reworked the book and Wildside is 
 		publishing under a new title and cover. The Hate Parallax presumes that 
 		the Cold War never ended, and instead lasted for a thousand years. The 
 		destruction of a holiday star-cruise liner sets the stage for a 
 		Galaxy-wide confrontation.

        I

 		friendship was soon formed. I learned that Joel was a native of Kansas, 
 		a proud father of a son, Nick, and a daughter, Rachel. In his business

 		responsibility to another, he was finally 
 		snapped up by First National Bank of Liberal (Kansas) where he is a 
 		member of the bank's senior staff and the Director of Information 
 		Services. His duties include creating the bank's strategic and tactical 
 		technology plan to serve and protect his customers and their

 		web site you are looking at that I have benefited greatly from Joel’s 
 		expertise, as has his company. But that says nothing of the close 
 		friendship we formed. However, in all that time we had never met in 
 		person. That small, missing part was resolved when Joel flew out to 
 		Florida for a business trip. He managed to squeeze in a few personal 
 		days, which he spent with myself and my wife, Kathryn, in Boca Raton. 
 		And what a glorious time we had. Dinners were eaten, stregg quaffed, 
 		beaches were strolled, sights were seen – including Joel’s first ride on 
 		an airboat and an encounter with alligators – and many a night crept 
 		into the wee hours as we solved all the world’s problems many times 
 		over. We were sorry to see him go and we both miss his smiling face and 
 		dry wit. But that’s the nice thing about the Twenty First Century. These 
 		days your friends are only the click of the mouse away.
