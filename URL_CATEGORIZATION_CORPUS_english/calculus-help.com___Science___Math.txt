           Calculus has the reputation of being one of the most challenging subjects in school, even when compared with other advanced math classes. That’s because calculus is usually the first exposure students get to a version of math that requires more than just memorization to succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many calculus classes have specific pre-requisites, such as an understanding of advanced algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. After all, it’s essentially another language. However, you’ll need more abstract qualities as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           A well-developed imagination will make it much easier to understand calculus. Since calculus works with physical, real-world concepts, the ability to visualize these things in your mind is crucial to your ability to understand and solve calculus problems.
          </p>
          <p>
           You also need to learn how to attack problems from different angles. There are specific rules in calculus that you’ll have to memorize, but not all calculus problems will follow a pre-set formula. You need to learn how to solve complicated problems without following a specific set of actions you’ve memorized.
          </p>
          <p>
           Overall, you’ll need advanced problem-solving skills if you want to succeed in calculus. To help you learn or build upon these skills, we’ll teach you to enhance your calculus capabilities with these brain-boosting tips.

           It may be an overwrought cliché, but this advice not only works for improving your mood, but it can also develop your ability to solve problems.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDC7Jpf8f4E">
            Studies have found
           </a>
           that dancing can improve your brain’s neural processing abilities. Structured dancing, such as tap and ballet, helps with convergent thinking—your ability to find a single, absolute answer to a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand, more improvised styles of dance, like hip-hop or EDM dancing, improves divergent thinking. That means you’ll have an easier time finding multiple possible answers for a complex problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since calculus requires both types of thinking, you should consider learning multiple styles of dance. Many schools offer dance classes as an alternative to physical education, or as an elective. If you don’t relish the idea of dancing in front of other people, you can also use Youtube to find dance tutorials and practice in the privacy of your home.

           Over the last decade or two, there has been a rise in the popularity of logic and puzzle games like sudoku. Electronic games designed to work out your brain can be found on nearly any video game platform as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           These types of games are not just a fun way to engage your mind when you’re bored; they’re also a great way to improve your problem-solving skills. Many logic or puzzle games require you to work a problem from multiple sides and have numerous ways of finding the solution.
          </p>
          <p>
           For many problems, both in games and in calculus, you’ll need to approach the problem backward, not forward. By practicing this strategy with fun games in your free time, you’ll find that you have an easier time working through your calculus problems as well.

           Obviously, exercise and a proper diet will benefit your body; however, science also proves that a healthy body leads to a healthy mind. People who regularly work out and eat wholesome, healthy food, have more energy, which helps their brain work faster and harder.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110">
            Researchers at Harvard found
           </a>
           that regular cardio exercise can actually increase the size of your hippocampus, which is the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning. It doesn’t take much, either—simply walking at a brisk pace for about two hours per week is enough to boost your mental function significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/boost-your-memory-by-eating-right">
            A similar Harvard study
           </a>
           also discovered a link between unhealthy food and memory problems. Scientists studied the effects of a diet high in LDL (“bad” cholesterol) and saturated fats on memory and found that participants performed much worse on tests of thinking and memory than people with a healthier diet.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since diet and exercise have positive effects on both your body and your mind, they’re likely to enhance your calculus capabilities as well. They can help relieve stress for keeping focused on your work.

           We’ve all experienced the adverse effects of sleeplessness—foggy brains, irritability, and lack of energy, to name a few.  Not getting a good night’s sleep can have a catastrophic impact on your ability to learn, as well as your problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p>
           REM sleep, in particular, is vital to your ability to form connections between unrelated ideas. That means your brain works while you’re sleeping to process everything you’ve learned and allowed you to see the bigger context of different subjects and ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
           REM sleep also enhances creative processing, your brain’s ability to form new ideas and ways of thinking about concepts you’ve learned in the past.

           A mind map is essentially a sketch of the problem and all the potential solutions. You can use this technique with any kind of question. Think of it as another way to brainstorm. By drawing out the issue, your mind may be stimulated to generate more ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Basically, you start with your problem in the center of the page. As you brainstorm possible solutions, add branches off the center containing these answers. You can divide these main branches into sub-branches, as you plug in your potential answer to the problem and work through it. If one solution doesn’t work, you move on to the next one and continue the process until one of them works.

           Idea Journals

            Many studies have shown
           </a>
           that the act of writing types of cement not only new ideas into your brain, but also generates new connections and creative ideas. The purpose of an idea journal is to provide a place for you to write out your problem and any subsequent ideas you generate over time.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we’ll discuss in a little bit, sometimes your brain will come up with solutions to a problem when you least expect it, while you’re showering or watching television or hanging out with friends. Keeping an idea journal with you at all times allows you to write out these solutions as soon as they pop into your head.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Talk it Out
          </h3>
          <p>
           For many people, the act of talking through a problem helps their mind sort through ideas and generate new solutions. Whether you’re talking to yourself, a friend, or a classmate, merely verbalizing the problem may lead you to blurt out the answer without realizing you knew it all along.
          </p>
          <p>
           One common strategy is to talk through the problem as if you were teaching the subject to someone else. By explaining the concepts involved in the question (to yourself or others), you could unlock the answers already hidden in your mind.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Create a Sketch.
          </h3>
          <p>
           As we mentioned earlier, most calculus problems can be represented physically—for instance, the shape of a curving slope, or the speed of a moving object. Sketching a visual representation of the problem could help you understand exactly what it is you’re trying to solve.

           Focus on Something Else.
          </h3>
          <p>
           You’ve probably heard the story of
           <a href="https://www.livescience.com/58839-archimedes-principle.html">
            Archimedes
           </a>
           , who found the answer to how to measure the volume of a king’s crown while taking a bath. While the anecdote may or may not be true, the idea of the brain finding solutions to problems while you’re focusing on something else is solid.
          </p>
          <p>
           By working on something else, particularly something that doesn’t require too much mental strain, you increase the psychological distance between yourself and your problem. That allows your brain to think more abstractly and creatively on the issue at hand while your attention is focused somewhere else.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Get Back to Basics.
          </h3>
          <p>
           If you’re still having trouble coming up with a solution, try going back to the beginning. Focus on the parts of the problem that you already understand, and work through as much of it as you can. In the process of rehashing familiar concepts, you may trick your brain into forming the complete solution.

            Calculus
           </a>
           is a branch of math that’s focused on the study of continuous change. Differential calculus looks at the instantaneous rate of change.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, what does that mean? We’ll use the speed of a car as an example. Your odometer gives you an estimate of how fast you’re driving, based on the distance you’ve traveled over the past few seconds. It works fairly quickly, but it’s not instant. If you wanted to know exactly how fast you were going at any given second, you’d need to use calculus to figure it out.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before we can explain how to do that, we need to define some of the terms you’ll use in calculus so you can follow along with our basic guide to differential calculus.

           You’ve probably already covered functions in advanced algebra or trigonometry, so we’ll just do a quick review. A function is typically notated like this: f(x) = y, though there’s usually much more to it than that.
          </p>
          <p>
           For an equation to be a function, any number you plug in as the (x) variable has to cause the equation to equal precisely one value of y.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Independent Variables

           An
           <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/independent-variable">
            independent variable
           </a>
           is a value of (x) in a function. It’s a number that you’re plugging into the function to change the output.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Dependent Variables

            dependent variable
           </a>
           is whatever value is yielded by the function, represented in our example as y. The value of y will change depending on the value of (x), the independent variable. The value of the independent variable always determines the value of a dependent variable.

          <h3>
           Domain
          </h3>
          <p>
           The domain of an equation or function is a set of all the possible values of the independent variable (x) that will produce a valid dependent variable (y). While the domain can be essentially infinite, for our purposes, we will create a relatively small domain.
          </p>
          <p>
           For our little function, we’ll say that x can be [1, 2, 3…9]
          </p>
          <p>
           The ellipsis (…) indicates that all numbers in between 3 and 9 are included in the domain. It’s just an easier way of writing it, so you don’t have to list every number in the set.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Limit
          </h3>
          <p>
           The limit is the value that y approaches as x approaches a given value. If that doesn’t make sense, think of it this way:
          </p>
          <p>
           In our domain, 9 is the highest value x can be. So, the limit of our function is the value of y as x gets closer to 9.
          </p>
          <p>
           Typically, we use this with much larger domains, where the highest possible value of x isn’t known or doesn’t exist because it’s infinite. The limit allows you to define the pattern of values for y that you can extrapolate for any possible value of x.

           Interval is a math term that isn’t limited to just calculus. It’s a set of numbers in between two given real numbers. Since those numbers can be broken down infinitesimally small, using an interval notation gives you a way to include all of those numbers without having to write them all out.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are two main types of intervals: closed and open.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Closed Interval
          </h3>
          <p>
           A closed interval is expressed as [a, b] which is a set of all numbers between a and b, including a and b themselves. Using the variable x to represent the set itself, you can write this as a ≤ x ≤ b.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Open Interval
          </h3>
          <p>
           An open interval is expressed using parenthesis instead of brackets, (a, b). That is a set of all numbers between a and b, NOT including a and b themselves. You can think of it as a &lt; x &lt; b.
          </p>
          <p>
           A half-open interval includes just one of its endpoints, meaning a ≤ x &lt; b, or vice versa. It’s expressed as [a, b), or (a, b].

            Derivatives
           </a>
           are a special type of function that calculates the rate of change of something. Expressed in a graph, derivatives are the calculation of the slope of a curved line.
          </p>
          <p>
           Derivatives are a fundamental concept of differential calculus, so you need to have a complete understanding of what they are and how they work if you’re going to survive the class.
          </p>
          <p>
           Simply put, a derivative explains how a pattern will change, allowing you to plot the past/present/future of the pattern on a graph, and find the minimums and maximums.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are several ways to represent the idea of derivatives:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Derivatives measure the pitch of the line that represents a function on a graph, at one particular point on that line. That means derivatives are the slope.
           </li>
           <li>
            If the independent variable (the “input” variable in a function) is “time,” then the derivative is the rate of change, as the velocity.
           </li>
           <li>
            If we look at a short section of the line of the function so that the line is nearly straight, the derivative of that section is the slope of the line.
           </li>
           <li>
            The slope of a line connecting two points on a function graph approaches the derivative when the interval between the points is zero.
           </li>
           <li>
            As we mentioned before, derivatives are functions, and they’re constantly changing. When you find the derivative of a function everywhere, you get another function, which you can then solve for the derivative of, leading to another function, which you can get the derivative of, and so on. Each derivative tells you the rate of change of the previous function.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           In a mathematical expression, the definition of derivative is:
          </p>
          <p>
           In this function, h is a point on the line that’s very close to zero, and the limit is all of the tiny numbers between h and zero.
          </p>

           Finding the derivative of a polynomial would be very tedious using limits and the slope formula. However, there is another way to calculate the derivative of polynomials. We’ll work through an example, step by step.
          </p>
          <p>
           First, you’ll need to multiply the exponent (2, as in x
           <sup>
            2
           </sup>
           ) by the coefficient (2, as in 2x). Then we reduce the exponent by 1.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since 2x
           <sup>
            1
           </sup>
           is simply 2x, the first term of the function can be expressed as 2*(2x), or 4x.
          </p>
          <p>
           We ended up with – 5(x
           <sup>
            0
           </sup>
           ) in the second term of the function by assuming the exponent in -5x could be written as -5x
           <sup>
            1
           </sup>
           , so we multiply it by the coefficient in front of the x, which is -5. Now we reduce the exponent by 1, which leaves us with 1*(-5)x
           <sup>
            0
           </sup>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Anything to the power of zero is one, so ultimately we get 1*(-5)*1, which equals -5.
          </p>
          <p>
           The third and final term of this function, +3, doesn’t have an x, which means it’s a constant. Following the same procedure as before, we start with 3x
           <sup>
            1
           </sup>
           . Multiplying the exponent by the coefficient, then reducing the exponent by 1, leaves us with 3x
           <sup>
            0
           </sup>
           .  Once the zero comes down, we end up with 0 as our third term.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our simplified derivative at the end of this process is:
          </p>
          <p>
           The original function we started with was quadratic, but the derivative we ended up with is linear. The derivative will always be one degree less than the original function.
          </p>

           <strong>
            Introduction
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Functions are used to describe mathematical things and can be difficult to define. The basic definition of a function can be said to be – a collection of ordered pairs of things, where the first members are fundamentally different in the pairs.
          </p>
          <p>
           A simple function can be as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
           [{1, 2}, {2, 4}, {3, 6}, {4, 18}, {5, 10}]
          </p>
          <p>
           The above function has five pairs where the first members are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
          </p>
          <p>
           Functions usually have alphabetical letter as their names. So if we term this function ‘f’, which is the most common letter used for functions, then it will be properly written as:
          </p>
          <p>
           f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 6, f(4) = 8, f(5) = 10
          </p>
          <p>
           Here are two definitions to keep in mind:
          </p>
          <p>
           The entire set of first numbers in the function is called a
           <strong>
            <em>
             domain
            </em>
           </strong>
           and the first members are called
           <strong>
            <em>
             arguments
            </em>
           </strong>
           . In this particular example, the domain has 5 numbers and the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the arguments of the function.
          </p>
          <p>
           The whole set of second numbers in the function is called the
           <strong>
            <em>
             range
            </em>
           </strong>
           and the second members are called the
           <strong>
            <em>
             values
            </em>
           </strong>
           . Going back to the above function, the range also has 5 numbers and the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 are the values of the function.
          </p>
          <p>
           As mentioned before, the standard naming of a function is f. Thus we can explain this function in a sentence as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
           The value of the function (f) at argument 1 is 2, its value at argument 2 is 4, its value at argument 3 is 6, its value at argument 4 is 8 and its value at argument 5 is 10.
          </p>
          <p>
           Therefore a function can also be defined as a set of assigned values (the second numbers) to arguments (the first numbers)
          </p>
          <p>
           This can be expanded further to say that the condition is that the first member of every pair is different; therefore each
           <strong>
            <em>
             argument
            </em>
           </strong>
           of the
           <strong>
            <em>
             domain
            </em>
           </strong>
           of
           <strong>
            <em>
             function
            </em>
           </strong>
           ‘f’ gets an exclusive value in its
           <strong>
            <em>
             range
            </em>
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The linear function and its importance to calculus
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The linear function is the basic and essential function, on which calculus is based upon. This is a function that has a straight line running through the domain of its graphs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such a line can be determined by two points that lie on it. Look at the function [a, f{a}], [b, f{b}]. You can pick an “a” and “b” in the domain and determine this line defined by the two values f{a} and f{b}.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            <em>
             Let’s look at the formula for such a function.
            </em>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           It is possible to determine the linear function for the two values mentioned above by using the following formula.
          </p>
          <p>
           f{x} = [f{a} x – b/ a – b] + [f{b} x – a/ b – a ]
          </p>
          <p>
           Effectively this means that the first term is 0 when x is equal to b, and it becomes f{a} when x equals a. The second term is 0 when x is equal to a and it becomes f{b} when x equals b.
          </p>
          <p>
           Another important aspect of a linear function is its
           <strong>
            <em>
             slope
            </em>
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           This is defined as the ratio of the change of function f between x = a and x = b the change in x between the two arguments. The y-intercept is the point at which the line passes the y-axis.
          </p>
          <p>
           The intercept of the line on the y axis is also an essential part of the linear function.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we have seen, a linear function can be defined one that has a graph with a straight line, and can be described by its slope and y-intercept.
          </p>
          <p>
           Special linear functions are often useful and they all have an important and unique property – they all have linear functions whose y-intercepts go through the point 0. Their graphs pass through the origin of the x and y axes. They are aptly called homogenous linear functions, and they all share the same property which is:
          </p>
          <p>
           Their value at any permutation of two arguments is equal to the same permutations of their values at those arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
           This can be explained by the following formula:
          </p>
          <p>
           F{ak + bc} = af{k} + bf{c}
          </p>
          <p>
           The above property is called the “property of linearity”.
          </p>
          <p>
           NOTE: not all linear functions have this property of linearity. The property implies that once you know the value of a linear function and any two distinct arguments, then you can find the value at any other point or pair of arguments. This is not always true.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Practical applications of the linear functions
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           There are several real life applications of calculus linear functions. Remember that this is the most basic function on which other functions are based upon. The function is applied in various fields, such as meteorology, pharmaceuticals, engineering, and a lot more.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whenever you have to create a graph in a straight line, no matter what the slope or y-intercept is, you are applying this basic principle.
          </p>
          <p>
           NOTE: One should not confuse linear functions in calculus to linear equations in algebra. They have different properties even if sometimes their graphs can be identical. You can find a graph for a linear equation of algebra having the same slope and y-intercept as a graph for linear function of calculus, but they do not represent the same properties.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Conclusion
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Starting off by understanding this basic formula of calculus will make it very easy for you to move on and understand the deeper functions or integration and differentiation. Calculus should not be a behemoth to be feared but a friend to be understood. Try out some basic exercises on the linear functions in calculus and you will get a better grip on the topic.

           You may think that I’m here to offer study techniques around memorizing equations and graphing, but I’d like to offer you something different.  It’s hopefully a technique that you have been told before, but I am here to re-iterate it to you. In fact, the entire strategy is around one simple idea.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sleep.  That’s right, good ‘ole fashion sleep.  One of the biggest mistakes that you can make going into your exam is just getting out of a late night cram session.  A sleep-deprived person
           <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory">
            cannot focus
           </a>
           and therefore cannot learn or apply anything efficiently. Secondarily, being chronically tired to the point of exhaustion means that you are less likely to perform well.  Which means that in the weeks leading up to your exam, you should be training your body to sleep better.
          </p>
          <p>
           So here is my suggestion for you.  If you are often too tired to stay awake for an early morning class, then
           <strong>
            take at least 10 days to re-adjust your sleep pattern
           </strong>
           so you can fall asleep earlier in the night.   Don’t try to change your pattern in just one night… it won’t work.
          </p>
          <p>
           Slowly change your routine so that on the night before the exam, you can fall asleep easier and be well rested.  My second piece of advice?  Wake up a little bit early and do some exercise.  Running, jumping jacks, sit-ups, anything to get the blood pumping.  About
           <a href="http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Health-Benefits-20-Minutes-Exercise-31023996">
            20 minutes of exercise
           </a>
           can help increase your mental energy and get you pumped.  Just make sure you shower after so you don’t distract your fellow test takers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember, sometimes you can do all the studying in the world but you leave out the essentials.  Don’t be like these students:

           as well.

          <h2>
           First Order Derivative
          </h2>
          <p>
           Now on the question at hand.  First, some quick references for you. The first derivative of the function f(x), is the slope of the tangent line to the function at the point x:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            If the first order derivative f’ is positive, then the function f is increasing (pointing upwards)
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           If the first derivative f’ is negative, then the function f is decreasing (pointing downwards)
          </p>
          <p>
           As for the second derivate, the second derivative of a function is the derivative of the derivative of that function:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            If the second derivative f” is positive , then the function f is concave up (looks like a U shape) .
           </strong>
          </p>
          <div id="_mcePaste">
          </div>
          <div id="_mcePaste">
           <p>
            <strong>
             If the second derivative f” is negative , then the function f is concave down (looks like an upside down U shape)
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The second derivative is like the movie
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">
             Inception
            </a>
            .  The first derivative tells us whether or not the function is increasing or decreasing.  The second derivative shows us whether or not the first derivative is increasing or decreasing. So the second derivative plays directly off of the first.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the second derivative turns out to be positive, then the first derivative will be increasing. The slope of the tangent line to the function is increasing as x increases.  If the second derivative turns out to be negative, then the first derivative is decreasing.  The slope of the tangent line to the function is then decreasing as x increases.

           Every day Mike gets a ton of email from people practically begging to buy advertisements on his site. Actual begging. We feel sorry for these people, because what they don’t know is that Mike made a (probably very short-sighted) pledge to never sell ads on the site for any reason. “But can’t we just throw money at you?” they ask, usually in the form of impersonal spam. “No,” Mike says. “I must hold to a promise, a sacred covenant, that I sometimes really regret making.” For those of you thinking, “Sure, there’s no advertising, but practically every page is an ad for Mike’s books. Doesn’t that count as advertising?” understand that I am staring at you with a squinty stare, telepathically asking you to kindly put a sock in it, because you’re embarrassing me in front of my new friends–friends that could potentially buy the calculator I ruined by signing it with a silver Sharpie.

           To help keep the site free, Mike is auctioning off this calculator, which is lightly used, but it contains all the important pieces (like connection cables, the manuals, an alternate TI-84 face plate (let your dork flag fly) and is in incredible shape. It works like a charm, as you can see by the mundane and meaningless calculations I took a picture of. In case you were wondering if this complicated piece of machinery can add, the answer is a resounding YES! (I may or may not have utilized the full power of this guy.)

           Unless you live in Chicago, the
           <a href="https://www.calculus-help.com/15-a-grizzly-motion-problem/">
            new Problem of the Week
           </a>
           may be unsettling because it is rife with bears. Not the cute kind of bears that get stuck in a rabbit’s tree house because they may or may not be morbidly obese. (“Oh, bother.”) No. These are the “I’d rather eat you, bones and all, than pretend that I am a cloud to hustle some bees out of their honey” kind of bears. The dangerous kind.
          </p>
          <p>
           Are you thinking, “This must be an optimization problem, where you are asked to calculate the
           <em>
            bear
           </em>
           minimum”? If you did think that, please know that I am, as you read this sentence, smiling approvingly and giving you polite golf applause for your clever pun. However, this problem is all about definite integrals, so there is no time for joking around.
          </p>
          <p>
           Steel yourself for the battle of your life! Attack this problem with your
           <em>
            bear
           </em>
           hands! But please, before you do, I would like the polite golf applause reciprocated.
