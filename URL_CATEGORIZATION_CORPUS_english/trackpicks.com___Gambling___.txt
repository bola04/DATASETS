       GENERAL RULES
      </span>
     </div>
     <span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px">
      Each and every handicapper that we monitor must follow a set of rules that we have in place in order to maximize the quality of information that we receive.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      They must:
      <br/>
      -Submit a maximum of 10 picks per day
      <br/>
      -Rate each pick between 1 to 5 units
      <br/>
      -Submit a maximum total of 30 units
      <br/>
      <br/>
      (this is to prevent a handicapper from submitting ten 5 unit plays. This way they must either submit only their best plays or discriminate between all their picks by rating them according to their strength)
     </span>
     <div align="center">
      <span style="font-size:11px;font-weight:bold">
       PLAY OF THE DAY
      </span>
     </div>
     <span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px">
      Each handicapper is allowed to designate one of their picks as a POD. This is not a requirement. But should they feel really strong about a particular play we highly recommend they make this designation. We track POD's separately in order to gauge each handicappers skill at assessing the strength of their picks.
 If you purchase a handicappers picks, you will see which pick is marked POD.

     <span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px">
      As a free benefit to the visitors of this site, we encourage the handicappers to designate one of their plays as a free pick. And in order to get quality free picks we do track these picks and rank them on the front page.

         </b>
         <p>
          All you need to do is click on Professional Registration and complete the
 registration form. Once that is completed, you may begin making picks by logging
 in with your username and password. Keep in mind that we verify your information
 from your registration. All registered handicappers must be true professionals
 otherwise you will be removed from our site.

 that were not recorded on the trackpicks.com site. Why is this so?

         </b>
         <p>
          We only post the predictions that were made by the handicapper when they logged
 in. The whole purpose of our site is to prove the integrity of our registered
 handicappers. If the handicapper is making claims that aren't backed up by our
 site, then you have to question whether they are a true professional or not.
 There are quite a few "scamdicappers" out there looking to take your money by
 saying whatever it takes to convince you that they know sports handicapping. The
 goal of TrackPicks.com is to bring back integrity to the handicapping profession
 that has been tainted by these scamdicappers.

           How are Baseball units earned determined?
          </li>
         </b>
         <p>
          On our site we track units earned by using the line on the pitcher at the time
 of the pick. There are four units earned outcomes for the handicapper when
 making picks. For our example we'll use the following:
         </p>
         Favorite pitcher (-155) Underdog pitcher (+135)
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <ol>
          <li>
           the handicapper picks the favorite pitcher and wins, they earn 1.0 units
          </li>
          <li>
           the handicapper picks the favorite pitcher and loses, they lose 1.55 units
          </li>
          <li>
           the handicapper picks the underdog pitcher and wins, they earn 1.35 units
          </li>
          <li>
           the handicapper picks the underdog pitcher and loses, they lose 1.0 units
          </li>
         </ol>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <b>
          <li>
           How are the other sports units earned determined?
          </li>
         </b>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         This is a little simpler than Baseball. TrackPicks uses the following formula:
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <ol>
          <li>
           the handicapper picks a team that wins by covering the spread then they earn 1.0 units
          </li>
          <li>
           the handicapper picks a team that loses by not covering the spread they lose 1.1 units Should they tie the spread, then the game becomes a "no pick" and they don't earn or lose any units
          </li>
         </ol>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <b>
          <li>
           How do I see exactly what picks a particular handicapper made?
          </li>
         </b>
         <p>
          First of all, we don't display picks made by the handicappers until the games
 have started. You can see these by clicking on "Today's Picks" in the menu. If
 you want to see picks they made in the past, click on the handicappers name
 anywhere in the site and it will bring up their statistical web page. Here
 you'll see a breakdown of all picks made by that particular handicapper. Just
 click on any of the league names or time frame and you'll see the games they
 made picks on and their outcomes.
         </p>
         <b>
          <li>
           Do you show consensus picks of all the handicappers?
          </li>
         </b>
         <p>
          No we don't. All our site does is help steer you in the right direction when
 deciding on which handicapper you would like to use. You can use our site in
 many ways. All handicappers are streaky. You want to find a handicapper that is
 hot right now. You can even get more specific in that you want to find a
 handicapper that does exceptionally well on a particular sport especially if
 they are hot right now in that sport.
         </p>
         <b>
          <li>
           Are you associated with any other sports service?
          </li>
         </b>
         Absolutely not! We are totally independent. We do not favor or promote one
 handicapper over another other than listing them in order of success. We do not
 have banners on our site advertising for any handicappers for that particular
 reason. If we find out that we are displaying banners for a site that is
 indirectly involved with a sports handicapper than we will stop it immediately.

           What can you tell me about your lines?
          </li>
         </b>
         <p>
          We use lines from the Stardust sportsbook in Las Vegas. We update them
   periodically throughout the day. Although lines change,  the lines that existed at the time of
   your picks are used in calculating your results. You are allowed to change
   your picks as many times as you want up to game time. This is an advantage for
   you to get the best possible line, so log in often and check to see if the
   line has moved in your favor.

           I made picks, how do I know they were recorded correctly?

         </b>
         <p>
          Click on "List Today's Picks" and your picks should be displayed. If not, try
   making them again. If they still haven't listed, then send us an e-mail with
   your display name and your picks. We'll then record them for you as long as
   the date and time of the e-mail are before game time. You may see any manually entered picks until
   the next day.
         </p>
         <b>
          <li>
           How do I look up picks I made in the past?

         </b>
         <p>
          Log out and click on "All Handicappers". Then click on your name. This will
   bring up your statistical web page. You can get a list of your picks by
   clicking on any of the categories on this page.

         <p>
          If you have a winning percentage over 55%, you are expected to make at least
   two picks per week. If you don't, we'll take you off the lists until you begin
   to make picks again. We do this for a reason; we don't want you stop using the
   site because you started the month out with a great winning percentage and you
   don't want to jeopardize it by continuing to make picks. A professional
   handicapper will make picks daily or weekly. We expect you to record those
   picks with us.
