     <p>
      After 8+ years of helping people communicate with friends and family during times of illness or hospitalization, we have shut down.  We're proud of the many years of support that we provided, and we're inspired by the strength of communities who rallied around those in need.  
 
 We want to make the transition as smooth as possible for everyone who used Carepages.  If you had an account with us, and you would like to preserve your posts as well as the responses from friends and family, please email support@support.carepages.com for additional assistance in retrieving your history.  
 
 Farewell.
