    I'm a Linux expert based in the Boston/Providence/Worcester area. I've
 written about 25 books on Linux and other computer topics, as well as a
 couple of

    </a>
    I'm currently
 employed by

   <p>
    I have three open source projects to my name (although one is so trivial
 that calling it a "project" may be stretching matters:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>
      <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/">
       GPT

     —This suite of programs (consisting of
     <tt>
      gdisk
     </tt>
     ,
     <tt>
      sgdisk
     </tt>
     , and
     <tt>
      cgdisk
     </tt>
     ) helps you manage
     partitions on disks that use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme. GPT
     fdisk is primarily a Linux tool, although it also compiles and works
     under FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows. A derivative of this project is
     my
     <a href="fixparts/index.html">
      FixParts
     </a>
     program, which fixes some
     problems with Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables I've seen
     reported far too frequently.

     <b>
      <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">
       rEFInd

     —My
     second major open source project is a fork of the
     <a href="http://refit.sourceforge.net">
      rEFIt
     </a>
     boot manager for EFI and UEFI
     computers. rEFInd adds various features and fixes a number of bugs in
     the original program. The combination of rEFInd and the Linux kernel's
     <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/efistub.html">

     —This
     program is a trivial utility that splits "fat" EFI binaries, which are
     sometimes used on Macs, into their component 32- and 64-bit versions.
     This is useful because ordinary UEFI-based PCs can't use Apple's
     proprietary "fat" binaries, but the single-architecture binaries that
     make up the "fat" binaries are often useful.

     Personal Interests
    </h2>
   </center>
   <p>
    For the past ten years, I've managed to build a career out of one of my
 interests: computers. I'm particularly interested in
    <a href="http://www.linux.com">
     Linux
    </a>
    and other Open Source software. I've
 written a few C and Pascal programs, but this isn't my greatest interest in
 the computer field. Instead, I enjoy learning about system administration,
 networking, and so on, and sharing that knowledge with others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another interest of mine is science fiction. I've got a web page with
 some of my
    <a href="books/books-noncomp.html">
     favorite SF books.
    </a>
    I'm
 also a big fan of
    <a href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html">
     Babylon 5,
    </a>
    which has
 done more for the medium of TV science fiction (or TV in general) than
 anything to come before it. Sadly, I don't have as much time to read
 science fiction as I'd like.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the summer of 1999, I took up sailing at
    <a href="http://www.community-boating.org">
     Community Boating.
    </a>
    I didn't
 really get very good at it in one season, but I did manage to capsize a
 boat once! (It was a squishy trip home after they pulled me out of the
 river.)
   </p>
   <p>
    More recently, I've begun biking regularly along the
    <a href="http://www.blackstoneriverbikeway.com">
     Blackstone River Bikeway,
    </a>
    which is within a mile of my house. It's great exercise and that particular
 bike path has some wonderful scenery.
   </p>
   <p>
    Photography is a long-time interest of mine. In 2005 I put together a
 darkroom in my basement -- something I've wanted to do since I was a
 teenager! I prefer film photography to digital for several reasons. Film
 appeals to me more aesthetically, it enables me to create something without
 the help of a computer, I've always preferred simplicity in my cameras, and
 replacing my film cameras and lenses with digital equipment would be
 prohibitively expensive. Although I'm not a big poster of photos in online
 forums, I do have a
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28347066@N05/">
     Flickr page
    </a>
    with a
 few samples of my photos. Mostly I use that page to demonstrate specific
 things, such as the results I get from outdated films.
