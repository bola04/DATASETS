   <p>
    This site contains my notes and solutions to various problems in some textbooks in physics and related fields. The site is 
   fairly technical, in that I use whatever mathematics is required to explain the various topics. It is most useful to those who
   are either taking a structured course at a university or online, or to those who are working through a topic on their own. 
   Although I've tried to make most articles self-contained, there is no substitute for a good textbook and/or an organized
   course. As such, I'd strongly recommend you buy a textbook (it doesn't have to be one of the ones I've used; there are many
   to choose from) and use that as your primary source. There are also many good courses available online for free at such 
   sites as
    <a href="https://www.edx.org/">
     edX
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">
     coursera
    </a>
    . There is also a large
   collection of lectures on several areas of physics given by Leonard Susskind on his
    <a href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses">
     Theoretical Minimum
    </a>
    site.

    Comments pointing out errors in an article or requesting clarification of some point in an article are welcome. 
 	As this site is not technically a blog, you will need to use the
    <a href="https://physicspagescomments.wordpress.com" target="_blank">
     auxiliary blog
    </a>
    to post comments.
   </p>
   <h5>
    If you want to comment on a particular article, PLEASE make sure you include
 	the URL of the article (just copy and paste it from your browser's address bar). Please also note
 	that due to time (and knowledge) limitations, I am not able to work through calculations or explain topics
 	not covered in one of my articles. You are welcome to submit comments of that sort, but I will simply post
 	them in the hope that some other reader will respond.
   </h5>
   <p>
    I will use the
    <a href="https://physicspagescomments.wordpress.com" target="_blank">
     auxiliary blog
    </a>
    to announce
 	new articles added to the main site, so if you want to be kept up to date, check that blog regularly, or else 
 	subscribe to it for email notifications. I realize this may look like a roundabout way of organizing things, but
 	I don't trust WordPress with anything substantial any more.
   </p>

    If you're seeking help on some topic in physics that isn't covered here, you may find
    <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/">

    helpful.

    A historical note for those who followed my old physicspages.com site. The original site was run using WordPress, but 
 	the underlying database got corrupted and was not possible to repair, even from the backup. As a result, I've rebuilt the 
 	site without using WordPress, so all the posts are now PDF files. Although PDFs have their problems, in that some browsers
 	don't display them fully without a plugin, they have the advantage that the Latex mathematics displays more neatly,
 	and some symbols not available in WordPress's implementation of Latex are now available.

     Please note

    Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about that, but hopefully in time these

    Here are some attempts at learning quantum field theory from various textbooks. Most of these books
  proved too difficult after a few pages, so the number of posts for them is quite limited. At present,
  I'm working through Lahiri &amp; Pal's book, which seems the most approachable and also has problems
  that for the most part, I can actually solve.
