      Advocacy for a Tiny House in Beckley
     </h2>
     <p>
      Jason, a person with a disability, decided to build himself a Tiny House. And then he discovered that a city ordance does not consider a Tiny House a real home and he can't get city power or water.

 <h2 align="center">It's A Fundraiser of Global Proportions</h2>
 
 <p><strong>Our funding for direct services has been cut by $130,021</strong>. There are people with disabilities who can't get in and out of their homes, waiting for services - some since 2014. This fundraiser is in progress and will continue until we reach our goal. </p>

 <p>We ask you to join us as we reach out to your friends near and across the globe and ask them to make donations, participate in fun-raisers,  volunteer services, and to do what they can so that people with disabilities in West Virginia may live independently.</p>

 <p>My Brother, My Brother and Me (MBMBaM) podcast named 2018 as the year of <strong>Collaborate</strong>, we are stronger together.</p>
  
 <p><img src="art/shirtmockup (110).png" alt="t-shirt" width="110" height="136" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;" />Dakota Phillips, a t-shirt maker in Iowa, a member of the Brotherhood of MBMBaM, and a fundraiser for Mountain State, thinks that all of the members of the MBMBaM fanbase need at least one t-shirt, if not five! All the proceeds go to Mountain State to help people with disabilities who need a ramp, bathroom modificaitons, hearing aids and more in order to be able to live independently.</p>
 
 <p>We are so grateful that one of the Guardian Angels suggested Mountain State to Dakota. We ask you all to be an angel and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dakotaph/collaborate-shirts-profits-to-go-to-2018-mbmbam-an" target="_blank">go to Datoka's Kickstarter page and make a donation</a> - or buy a Collaborate t-shirt, and maybe a hoodie too, and support people with disabilities in West Virginia.</p>
  
 <p>Thank you to all the Angels out there who have and continue to support us.</p>
