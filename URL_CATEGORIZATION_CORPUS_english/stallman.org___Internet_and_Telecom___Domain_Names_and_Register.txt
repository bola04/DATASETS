       systematically cheat
      </a>
      low-wage employees out of their pay.
      <p>
       We should make participation in cheating employees a crime for the
       individuals that do it, to threaten the managers responsible
       with jail, rather than merely the corporation with a small fine.
      </p>

      There is a
      <a href="http://web-old.archive.org/web/20180409163324/https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-blockchain-fifo-dirty-coins/">
       threat to wipe out bitcoin
      </a>
      , and all cryptocurrencies, using a
     strained legal excuse.  The threat is to confiscate individual
     bitcoins if those specific coins were used previously in some illegal
     transaction, or passed through a broker that was later accused of any
     sort of crime.
      <p>
       The article describes two alternative plans for choosing who to punish
       in this way, but the effect would be the same: to punish ordinary
       users of bitcoins effectively at random.  Ostensibly it is not random,
       but rather based on a criterion that ordinary users couldn't hope to
       check, so it's effectively equivalent to punishment at random.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is fundamentally unjust to subject people to punishment at random.
       Constitutions ought to insist that no one can be punished, or legally
       discriminated against, or have property seized, based on circumstances
       not feasible for them to have recognized and avoided.

      A global requirement to

       list the ultimate beneficial owner
      </a>
      of
     every company would put a big crimp in global corruption.
      <p>
       Even if many small countries do not adopt this requirement, large
       countries could effectively make it compulsory by denying the tax
       deduction as a business expense for payments to companies whose
       ultimate beneficial owner is not registered.

      We need a law requiring the immigration agency to publish all
     its data

     publicly asks.  We must not allow the agency to hide its refusal to
     explain itself to the victim behind a facade of concern for the
     victim's own privacy.

     No national identity cards
    </h3>
    <p>
     I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
 identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
 confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
 gnu.org.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
 and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK.
 Australia's previous government tried to
 institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
 the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
 in a grand act of oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
     Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
 but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
 have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
 For example, the national ID number is often required to
 rent a video or use a gym.
    </p>
    <p>
     Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
 services use this card to identify people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Norway will impose a national

     The Lifelong Activist
    </h3>
    <p>
     People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
 progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
 years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
 recommending a book,
     <a href="http://lifelongactivist.com">
      The Lifelong Activist
     </a>
     by Hillary Rettig.
    </p>
    <p>
     I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
 part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
     <em>
      being
     </em>
     marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
 business, and politics is something much more
 important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
 the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
 techniques from marketing and sales.

      "Those who profess to favor freedom, yet depreciate agitation, are
       men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without
       thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its
       many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical
       one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle.
       Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never
