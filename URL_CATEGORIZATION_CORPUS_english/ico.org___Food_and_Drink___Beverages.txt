        Prices for all coffee groups increased in May
       </h2>
       <p>
        In May 2018, the ICO composite indicator increased by 0.7% to an average of 113.34 US cents/lb, following three months of declines. Prices for all coffee groups rose in May 2018, though the largest month-on-month increase occurred for Other Milds, which grew by 0.9% to 135.61 US cents/lb. Global coffee exports amounted to 10.18 million bags in April 2018, compared with 9.50 million in April 2017, driven by an increase of 14.1% for Robusta shipments and 6.8% for Colombian Milds. World production in 2017/18 is estimated 1.2% higher at 159.66 million bags with output expected to grow in eight of the ten largest coffee-producing countries.

        In April 2018, the ICO composite indicator decreased by 0.4% to an average of 112.56 US cents/lb, with the daily price ranging between 110.49 US cents/lb and 114.73 US cents/lb. Prices for all three Arabica groups fell in April 2018, though the largest month-on-month decrease occurred for Brazilian Naturals, which fell by 0.9% to 118.76 US cents/lb. The monthly average for Robusta, on the other hand, increased by 0.1% to 88.31 US cents/lb. Global coffee exports amounted to 10.81 million bags in March 2018, compared with 10.91 million in March 2017, driven by decreased shipments of Arabica, particularly Colombian Milds. Exports in the first six months of coffee year 2017/18 decreased by 0.6% to 59.96 million bags compared to the same period in the last coffee year.

        Coffee market continues downward trend
       </h2>
       <p>
        Since August 2017, the ICO composite indicator price has declined in each month except January 2018. The composite indicator decreased by 1.1% in March 2018 to an average of 112.99 US cents/lb, which is the lowest monthly price since February 2016. Indicator prices for all groups fell in March 2018, though the largest month-on-month decrease occurred for Colombian Milds, which fell by 1.4% to 139.45 US cents/lb. This narrowed the price differential between Colombian Milds and Other Milds to an average of 4.42 US cents/lb, 15.3% lower than last month. Global production is estimated at 159.66 million bags in 2017/18, 1.2% higher than 2016/17, resulting in an estimated surplus of 0.78 million bags. Arabica production is estimated 4.6% lower at 97.43 million bags while Robusta is estimated 12.1% higher at 62.24 million bags. The surplus in production is reflected in increased shipments for all groups, except Colombian Milds, during the first five months of coffee year 2017/18.

       <p>
        On 9 March 2018, the Executive Director, Mr José Sette, was honoured to welcome His Excellency Mr Alexandre Fasel, who visited the offices of the ICO for the first time since taking up his post as Ambassador of Switzerland to the United Kingdom.
 
 Accompanied by First Secretary, Ms Stefanie Küng, Ambassador Fasel met with senior members of the ICO team to discuss the challenges and opportunities for the coffee sector, including the need to foster sustainability to address quality, safety and productivity issues, climate change, gender and small growers needs. A new approach to project development and funding being developed by the ICO was also discussed at length.

        Coffee market settles lower amidst strong global exports
       </h2>
       <p>
        The ICO composite indicator price declined by 1.2% in February 2018 to an average of 114.19 US cents/lb. Indicator prices for all three Arabica groups fell in February 2018 while the indicator price for Robusta increased slightly by 0.7% to an average of 89.24 US cents/lb. Exports of Robusta coffee are estimated up 48.2% to 4.48 million bags in January 2018 and up 6.4% to 14.87 million bags for the first four months of coffee year 2017/18. This is largely due to increased shipments from Vietnam in January 2018, which are estimated at 3.29 million bags, nearly double the volume from one year ago. In the first four months of 2017/18, exports of Other Milds and Brazilian Naturals rose by 9.3% to 7.62 million bags and 2.2% to 13.31 million bags, respectively. Export growth for Other Milds was led by increased shipments from Honduras while Ethiopia led the growth for exports of Brazilian Naturals.  In contrast, shipments of Colombian Milds during the same period fell by 10.9% to 4.94 million bags as excessive rains in Colombia have led to decreased output.

Shipments of Arabica were 5.5% lower at 6.06 million bags while Robusta shipments decreased by 15.9% to 2.96 million bags. Global coffee output for 2017/18 is preliminary estimated at 158.78 million bags, 0.7% higher than last year. Arabica production is provisionally estimated at 97.32 million bags, 1.1% lower than last year due to an expected reduction in output from Colombia and Brazil. However, Robusta production is provisionally estimated 3.7% higher than last year at 61.46 million bags, due largely to growth in Vietnam.

        The ICO composite indicator price averaged 117.26 US cents/lb in November 2017, down 2.3% from October 2017. However, nearly all of the decrease occurred in prices for Robusta, which decreased by 7.2% to an average of 91.33 US cents/lb in November 2017. Exports in October 2017 were 11.4% lower than the same month last year on 8.8 million bags. Shipments of Arabica were 9.9% lower at 5.7 million bags. As discussed later in this report, production in some countries in Central America &amp; Mexico has partially recovered from the outbreak of leaf rust a few years ago. In crop year 2016/17, Honduras and Nicaragua surpassed the volume of output achieved before the outbreak. However, output from Guatemala and El Salvador has recovered from the low volumes in crop years 2012/13 and 2013/14, but remains below the average volume of production from before the outbreak.

        Total exports in September 2017 reached 8.34 million bags, compared to 9.8 million in September 2016. While coffee year 2016/17 registered a decrease in its final month, total exports reached a record 122.45 million bags, 4.8% greater than the 116.89 million bags shipped in coffee year 2015/16. Exports of Colombian Milds grew by 8% to 14.66 million bags, Other Milds by 15.6% to 27.02 million bags, and Brazilian Naturals by 2.6% to 35.84 million bags while Robusta shipments remained stable, amounting to 44.93 million bags. Global coffee production in crop year 2016/17 has been revised upwards to 157.44 million bags, a 3.4% increase on 2015/16, due largely to the increase in production for Honduras. The ICO composite indicator continued its downward trend, averaging 120.01 US cents/lb in October 2017, which is the lowest level since May 2016 when it averaged 119.91 US cents/lb.

        The ICO composite indicator continued its downward trend that started
  at the end of August, averaging 124.45 US cents/lb. 
 
 Prices for all groups fell in September, though Robusta saw the largest decline of 5.1% compared to August. 
 
 This brings coffee year 2016/17 to an end, and global production is estimated at 153.9 million bags, a 1.5% increase on 2015/16. 
 With world consumption at 155.1 million bags, this gives a global deficitof 1.2 million bags.

        Coffee prices climb to a 4-month high but subsequently fall in view of a well-supplied market
       </h2>
       <p>
        The ICO composite indicator rallied briefly to above 135 US cents/lb but quickly fell back to the level of June. This comes as cumulative exports in the current coffee year remain at very high levels, up 5.9% year on year, leading to higher inventories in importing countries. The outlook for the 2017/18 crop in Vietnam and the 2018/19 crop in Brazil is largely positive.

        The ICO composite indicator price rose above 130 US cents/lb for the first time since April as reports emerged from Brazil about lower yields and quality issues related to the 2017/18 crop. Coffee exports have stabilized in the last two months but cumulative exports remain well above the levels reached in the previous year and leave consumer stocks well supplied. The production estimate for 2016/17 has been revised up to 153.9 million bags, which constitutes an all-time record. The output of Arabica and Robusta is estimated to be 10.2% higher and 10.6% lower compared to coffee year 2015/16, respectively.
