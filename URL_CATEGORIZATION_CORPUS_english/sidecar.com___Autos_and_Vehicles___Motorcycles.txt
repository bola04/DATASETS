          e are the United Sidecar Association, an independent, not-for-profit organization of diverse people from all walks of life who share a common interest  motorcycles with sidecars. The USCA was founded in 1976 in the Chicago area, but has grown to include members throughout the USA, Canada, and, in fact, throughout the world
         </p>
         <p>
          Our leadership consists of an elected board of directors comprised of a
          <b>

            President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and seven Regional Directors.
           </a>
          </b>
          We also boast a strong volunteer staff that provides support on many levels; volunteers help in administrative tasks, and can serve as state representatives. We are truly an organization as strong as its members, and welcome anyone who may want to offer their time and talent.

          ur activities revolve around motorcycles and sidecars. In the early part of the 20th Century, long before family values became a slogan, motorcyclists attached sidecars to cycles so that they could take family and friends with them on their adventures. This same spirit is what we foster and in the energy behind what we do.
         </p>
         <p>
          USCA activities are planed around family and friends. We enjoy going to rallies, touring, camping out, or even just calling up a friend to go on a casual ride. People are what we are about.
         </p>
         <p>
          The USCA is about people. Making new friendships, keeping old one alive, and helping others, all while enjoying our motorcycles and sidecars. And you don't even have to own a rig to be part of it, as membership is open to anyone expressing an interest in our sport.
