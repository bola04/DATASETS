       Fast array and matrix processing
      </h6>
      <p>
       In AmiBroker Formula Language (AFL) vectors and matrices are native types like plain numbers. To calculate mid point of High and Low arrays element-by-element you just type
       <code>
        MidPt = ( H + L )/2;
        <i>
         // H and L are arrays
        </i>
       </code>
       and it gets compiled to vectorized machine code. No need to write loops. This makes it possible to run your formulas at the same speed as code written in assembler. Native fast matrix operators and functions make statistical calculations a breeze.
      </p>
      <h6>
       Concise language means less work
      </h6>
      <p>
       Your trading systems and indicators written in AFL will take less typing and less space than in other languages because many typical tasks in AFL are just single-liners. For example dynamic, ATR-based Chandelier's stop is just:
       <code>
        <b>
         ApplyStop
        </b>
        ( stopTypeTrailing, stopModePoint, 3*
        <b>
         ATR
        </b>
        (14), True, True );
