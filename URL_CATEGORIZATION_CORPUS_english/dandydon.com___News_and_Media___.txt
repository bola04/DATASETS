             <strong>
              Good morning, Tiger Fans,
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Yesterday was a monumental day for LSU football as Coach Orgeron and staff landed a commitment from the nation’s top 2019 cornerback, Derek Stingley, Jr.
             </strong>
             In fact, I’d go so far as to say that other than National Signing Days, yesterday was the biggest day in LSU football recruiting since January 2, 2014, when the Tigers landed commitments from future All-Americans Leonard Fournette and Jamal Adams on the same day.
             <em>
              (Ironically, many fans were disappointed on that day back in 2014 because they were expecting a “5-for-5” day, but I digress.)
             </em>
             Folks, Stingley is the same caliber of player as those two former Tiger All-Americans, and what makes his commitment all the more praiseworthy is that it addresses a major position of need in this recruiting class.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Stingley is the consensus No. 1 cornerback in the nation and is rated as the No. 1 overall player in his class by Rivals.com.
             </strong>
             At 6-foot-1, 193 pounds and with blazing 4.3 speed, it’s easy to see why he’s so highly regarded, but those measurables don’t even begin to tell the story of what makes Stingley, Jr. so special. He’s also an honors student with a tremendous work ethic and an athletic pedigree that’s hard to beat. As pointed out in
             <a href="https://247sports.com/college/lsu/Article/LSU-football-recruiting-Tigers-get-commitment-from-2019s-top-cornerback-Derek-Stingley--119203755/" target="_blank">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
               this article by 247Sports
              </span>
             </a>
             , Derek Jr.’s father was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1993 Major League Baseball draft. After playing a bit of minor league baseball, the elder Derek returned to football as a player and coach in the Arena League before coaching his son in middle school and high school at Dunham School, where he is currently the defensive backs coach. Taking it a step further back, Derek Stingley, Jr.’s grandfather, Darryl Stingley, played wide receiver at Purdue and a was a first-round draft pick in 1973 by the New England Patriots. Some say Derek, Jr. may be the most talented of the bunch, and that’s saying a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Another thing that stands out about Derek, Jr. is that he appears to have a good head on his shoulders.
             </strong>
             I admire the fact that he didn’t put on a dog-and-pony show to announce his commitment. On Tuesday, he stated that he would announce his school of choice at 1:30 p.m. on Twitter. I assumed that would mean 1:40 or 1:45 since a lot of prospects love the attention that comes with keeping folks in suspense. That was not the case with Stingley. At 1:29 p.m., he announced the news with
             <a href="Derek_Stingley_Commits.php">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
               this classy video
              </span>
             </a>
             and a simply-stated message that read, “I know I can’t please everyone.. In my heart, I truly feel this is the right place for me. I’m all in! 100% committed! Please respect my decision.”
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              As for his on-the-field virtues, Stingley’s statistics from his junior season pretty much paint a picture of the type of lock-down cornerback he is.
             </strong>
             Opponents only threw 18 passes in his direction. He intercepted 11 of them and broke up six. (Yes, you read that right. Only one pass was completed against him, and it was a bit of a “gimme” at the end of the half.) Judging by

              </span>
             </a>
             and LSU’s current depth at cornerback, Stingley would likely start at LSU this season if he could sign as a junior in high school. Of course, LSU will have to wait until the 2019 season when Stingley and 2016’s top-rated cornerback prospect Kristian Fulton could very well give LSU the strongest duo of cornerbacks in the country. Stingley is expected to sign with LSU in December and begin school in January as an early enrollee.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              With offers from virtually every major program in the nation, Stingley chose LSU over Florida and Texas.
             </strong>
             With his pledge, LSU’s 2019 class now contains
             <a href="lsu_football_commitments.php">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
               13 commitments
              </span>
             </a>
             and is ranked No. 10 in the country in 247Sports’ Composite Team Rankings. With prospects like five-star Ishmael Sopsher, four-stars Devin Bush and Donté Starks, and several other in-state standouts still in play, LSU’s 2019 class could be one for the ages.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In other football recruiting news, we mentioned one prospect from Alabama who would be making an official visit to LSU this weekend – LB Ke'Shun Brown – but there is another.
             </strong>
             Cornerback Cordale Flott of Saraland, Ala. will also be making his way to LSU for an official visit. What’s particularly interesting about him is that he is currently committed to Auburn. With the addition of Derek Stingley, Jr. to go along with Maurice Hampton of Memphis and Marcus Banks of Houston, LSU already has three cornerbacks on the board and appears to be in good shape with in-state four-star cornerback Devin Bush, who is expected to announce his school of choice in August.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Also, LSU entertained four-star Hawaiian linebacker Maninoa Tufono and his family yesterday, and apparently it went very well.
             </strong>
             Afterward, Tufonu tweeted, “Just want to thank and give all my appreciation to Coach O and Coach Aranda for having my family and I. It was such a “eye opening” unofficial visit…” Tufuno (6-3, 225, Honolulu) is ranked as the nation’s No. 6 inside linebacker by 247Sports.
            </p>

             <strong>
              Moving on with our Countdown to Game Day, which is at the 73-day mark, today we remember a play that showed the whole world the importance of field position.
             </strong>
             You guessed it – I’m talking about Brad Wing’s 73-yard punt during LSU’s 9-6 overtime win over Alabama in 2011. The “Game of the Century,” as it was called, took place at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and featured two unbeaten powerhouses in No. 1 LSU and No. 2 Alabama. Pressed inside their own 10-yard line in a 6-6 affair in the fourth quarter, the Tigers were forced to punt out of their own end zone. Wing let fly a field-reversing punt that rolled dead at the Alabama 18-yard line. In a game where every inch mattered, Wing came through big-time. The play remains somewhat controversial even today as some say the ball hit the overhead Sky Cam wire, changing its trajectory and resulting in a very gratuitous bounce for the Tigers. Whether that was the case or not, it was one heck of a kick and a game-changing play in one of the best contests I’ve ever witnessed. (
             <a href="media_gallery.php?id=300">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">

             </a>
             .)
            </p>

             Wing was the first Aussi punter signed by LSU, but since then LSU has signed two more including Jamie Keehn and this year’s returning projected starter, Josh Growden. All three of these punters from down under were recruited during the Les Miles era, making it interesting to speculate whether LSU’s Australian punter pipeline will continue under Ed Orgeron.

             <strong>
              Good morning, Tiger Fans,
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Yesterday was a monumental day for LSU football as Coach Orgeron and staff landed a commitment from the nation’s top 2019 cornerback, Derek Stingley, Jr.
             </strong>
             In fact, I’d go so far as to say that other than National Signing Days, yesterday was the biggest day in LSU football recruiting since January 2, 2014, when the Tigers landed commitments from future All-Americans Leonard Fournette and Jamal Adams on the same day.
             <em>
              (Ironically, many fans were disappointed on that day back in 2014 because they were expecting a “5-for-5” day, but I digress.)
             </em>
             Folks, Stingley is the same caliber of player as those two former Tiger All-Americans, and what makes his commitment all the more praiseworthy is that it addresses a major position of need in this recruiting class.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Stingley is the consensus No. 1 cornerback in the nation and is rated as the No. 1 overall player in his class by Rivals.com.
             </strong>
             At 6-foot-1, 193 pounds and with blazing 4.3 speed, it’s easy to see why he’s so highly regarded, but those measurables don’t even begin to tell the story of what makes Stingley, Jr. so special. He’s also an honors student with a tremendous work ethic and an athletic pedigree that’s hard to beat. As pointed out in
             <a href="https://247sports.com/college/lsu/Article/LSU-football-recruiting-Tigers-get-commitment-from-2019s-top-cornerback-Derek-Stingley--119203755/" target="_blank">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
               this article by 247Sports
              </span>
             </a>
             , Derek Jr.’s father was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1993 Major League Baseball draft. After playing a bit of minor league baseball, the elder Derek returned to football as a player and coach in the Arena League before coaching his son in middle school and high school at Dunham School, where he is currently the defensive backs coach. Taking it a step further back, Derek Stingley, Jr.’s grandfather, Darryl Stingley, played wide receiver at Purdue and a was a first-round draft pick in 1973 by the New England Patriots. Some say Derek, Jr. may be the most talented of the bunch, and that’s saying a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Another thing that stands out about Derek, Jr. is that he appears to have a good head on his shoulders.
             </strong>
             I admire the fact that he didn’t put on a dog-and-pony show to announce his commitment. On Tuesday, he stated that he would announce his school of choice at 1:30 p.m. on Twitter. I assumed that would mean 1:40 or 1:45 since a lot of prospects love the attention that comes with keeping folks in suspense. That was not the case with Stingley. At 1:29 p.m., he announced the news with
             <a href="Derek_Stingley_Commits.php">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
               this classy video
              </span>
             </a>
             and a simply-stated message that read, “I know I can’t please everyone.. In my heart, I truly feel this is the right place for me. I’m all in! 100% committed! Please respect my decision.”
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              As for his on-the-field virtues, Stingley’s statistics from his junior season pretty much paint a picture of the type of lock-down cornerback he is.
             </strong>
             Opponents only threw 18 passes in his direction. He intercepted 11 of them and broke up six. (Yes, you read that right. Only one pass was completed against him, and it was a bit of a “gimme” at the end of the half.) Judging by

               Stingley’s incredible video highlights
              </span>
             </a>
             and LSU’s current depth at cornerback, Stingley would likely start at LSU this season if he could sign as a junior in high school. Of course, LSU will have to wait until the 2019 season when Stingley and 2016’s top-rated cornerback prospect Kristian Fulton could very well give LSU the strongest duo of cornerbacks in the country. Stingley is expected to sign with LSU in December and begin school in January as an early enrollee.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              With offers from virtually every major program in the nation, Stingley chose LSU over Florida and Texas.
             </strong>
             With his pledge, LSU’s 2019 class now contains
             <a href="lsu_football_commitments.php">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
               13 commitments
              </span>
             </a>
             and is ranked No. 10 in the country in 247Sports’ Composite Team Rankings. With prospects like five-star Ishmael Sopsher, four-stars Devin Bush and Donté Starks, and several other in-state standouts still in play, LSU’s 2019 class could be one for the ages.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In other football recruiting news, we mentioned one prospect from Alabama who would be making an official visit to LSU this weekend – LB Ke'Shun Brown – but there is another.
             </strong>
             Cornerback Cordale Flott of Saraland, Ala. will also be making his way to LSU for an official visit. What’s particularly interesting about him is that he is currently committed to Auburn. With the addition of Derek Stingley, Jr. to go along with Maurice Hampton of Memphis and Marcus Banks of Houston, LSU already has three cornerbacks on the board and appears to be in good shape with in-state four-star cornerback Devin Bush, who is expected to announce his school of choice in August.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Also, LSU entertained four-star Hawaiian linebacker Maninoa Tufono and his family yesterday, and apparently it went very well.
             </strong>
             Afterward, Tufonu tweeted, “Just want to thank and give all my appreciation to Coach O and Coach Aranda for having my family and I. It was such a “eye opening” unofficial visit…” Tufuno (6-3, 225, Honolulu) is ranked as the nation’s No. 6 inside linebacker by 247Sports.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Moving on with our Countdown to Game Day, which is at the 73-day mark, today we remember a play that showed the whole world the importance of field position.
             </strong>
             You guessed it – I’m talking about Brad Wing’s 73-yard punt during LSU’s 9-6 overtime win over Alabama in 2011. The “Game of the Century,” as it was called, took place at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and featured two unbeaten powerhouses in No. 1 LSU and No. 2 Alabama. Pressed inside their own 10-yard line in a 6-6 affair in the fourth quarter, the Tigers were forced to punt out of their own end zone. Wing let fly a field-reversing punt that rolled dead at the Alabama 18-yard line. In a game where every inch mattered, Wing came through big-time. The play remains somewhat controversial even today as some say the ball hit the overhead Sky Cam wire, changing its trajectory and resulting in a very gratuitous bounce for the Tigers. Whether that was the case or not, it was one heck of a kick and a game-changing play in one of the best contests I’ve ever witnessed. (

             Wing was the first Aussi punter signed by LSU, but since then LSU has signed two more including Jamie Keehn and this year’s returning projected starter, Josh Growden.

              Derek Stingley,
             </strong>
             set to announce his school of choice at 1:30 p.m., today is a pivotal day for Coach Ed Orgeron’s reputation as an upper-echelon recruiter.  Not only is Stingley the best prospect in the nation at LSU’s biggest position of need, he’s also a homegrown talent from LSU’s proverbial backyard (Dunham School in Baton Rouge). His commitment to LSU would catapult LSU’s 2019 class from average to outstanding, while his commitment elsewhere would be a major setback to Orgeron in his quest to take advantage of Louisiana’s exceptionally talented – dare I say unprecedented – class of 2019 prospects.

             <strong>
              2. The big announcement will come at approximately 1:30 this afternoon
             </strong>
             without a lot of fanfare. “I will not have any hats on tables, nor will I have a press conference,” Singley announced yesterday. In this day and age full of theatrical “look at me” shenanigans, that’s awfully refreshing. As soon as Stingley makes his intentions known via Twitter, I’ll tweet the news to those of you who

             A commitment from Stingley today would give LSU’s staff a ton of momentum during what is arguably
             <strong>
              LSU’s biggest recruiting week of the year
             </strong>
             . What makes it so special is not only Stingley’s announcement but the fact that LSU will be holding its “elite camp” starting tomorrow and running through Saturday. Additionally, LSU will have at least one official visitor on campus this weekend as four-star Carver (Ala.) linebacker Ke'Shun Brown will be making an official visit.

             </strong>
             Mentioning linebacker Ke'Shun Brown reminds me to pass along this bit of news about LSU’s All-SEC linebacker,
             <strong>
              Devin White.
             </strong>
             Get this: In Sports Illustrated Top 100 College Football Players of 2018, White checked in at No. 75. So far, Sports Illustrated has only announced numbers 51-100 on its list, and what makes White’s ranking even harder to swallow for Tiger Fans is that Louisiana’s own Dylan Moses, who notoriously spurned LSU and chose to sign with Alabama, ranks above White at No. 51. This is ridiculous in my opinion and should only add fuel to White’s fire as he looks to prove that he is the best linebacker in college football.

             While on the topic of
             <strong>
              meaningless rankings
             </strong>
             , here’s another to fire up Tiger Fans. In CBSSports’ ranking of “the top 25 quarterback rooms in college football ahead of the 2018 season,” LSU checks in at No. 22. Here’s what they had to say about it: “With the arrival of Burrow, this room went from a huge question mark to a potential strength for the Tigers. Burrow doesn’t bring experience to LSU, but he brings a ton of ability and he gives a young, talented depth chart time to mature. By the time Burrow is gone, Brennan will be physically prepared to take over or Narcisse will have developed enough as a passer to be effective.” Five SEC teams rank higher than LSU on the list, including Alabama at No. 2.

             You’ve probably noticed in our position reviews and in previous updates that we’re really stoked about LSU’s defensive line this year. At the heart of that unit is
             <strong>
              Rashard Lawrence
             </strong>
             whom I firmly believe will prove to be one of the Tigers’ all-time great defensive ends this season. On Monday, our friend Mike Detillier asked former LSU defensive line coach Pete Jenkins about Lawrence during an offensive and defensive linemen camp at Nicholls.
             <a href="Pete_Jenkins_Rashard_Lawrence.php">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
               His response
              </span>
             </a>
             began with a Ric Flair-like “Woooo! Wooo!” that tells you everything you need to know about his opinion of Lawrence. He went on to say he’s been coaching 52 years and Lawrence might be the toughest football player he’s ever coached.

             With the start of football season 74 days away, today we continue our
             <strong>
              countdown
             </strong>
             by quickly recalling an LSU All-American who wore No. 74 from 1951-1954 –
             <strong>
              Sid Fournet
             </strong>
             . Originally from Bogalusa, Louisiana, Fournet was a tremendous lineman who played on both sides of the line and was credited with seeing action in 83% of LSU’s plays during his senior year, when he served as captain of the team. After his playing days as a Tiger, Fornet was selected in the second round of the NFL draft in 1955 and went on to play seven seasons and 82 games combined with the Los Angeles Rams, Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Texans and New York Titans/Jets. The versatility he demonstrated in college was also on display in the pros, as Fournet played the offensive line, linebacker, and defensive back positions. After his football career, Sid worked as a car salesman. In 2011, he passed away at the age of 78.

             Turning to baseball, LSU centerfielder
             <strong>
              Zach Watson
             </strong>
             is one of eight outfield finalist for the Rawlings Gold Glove for his 2018 season. There’s no understating how huge it is for LSU to have Watson and Antoine Duplantis coming back, along with Daniel Cabrera, to give LSU what will easily be one of the best outfields in college baseball in 2019.
