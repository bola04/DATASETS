               The history of religious movements seems filled with examples of religious figures proudly proclaiming the imminent coming of God, along with redemption for the faithful and punishment for unbelievers.   Many of these religious figures even  give a specific date so their followers could wrap up their affairs and get ready.  And, based on these confident prognostications,  far too many followers ended up doing  just that, even to the point of quitting jobs or selling their houses to await the promised day.   That this day of judgment has yet to materialize hardly seems to matter to the believers, all of which makes stories such as this sound so incredible.
              </p>
              <p>
               And so we come to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilbur_Glenn_Voliva" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Wibur Glenn Voliva
               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Born in 1870 and raised in Illinois, Voliva's improbably career began, like so many others, as an acolyte to the charismatic
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Dowie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                John Alexander Dowie
               </a>
               .   It was Dowie who founded the city of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion,_Illinois" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Zion, Illinois
               </a>
               in 1901 as a religious community and the hub of his Christian Catholic Apostolic Church.    Having joined Dowie's church in 1898, Voliva became one of his chief lieutenants and even traveled to Australia in 1901 to oversee the church's Australian branch.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an evangelist and faith healer, Dowie had already gained fame at the 1893 World's Fair holding "big tent" meetings and relying on tricks that seem little different from faith healers today.   With thousands of followers, he founded the city of Zion only a short distance from Chicago.   But Dowie was also shrewd financially.   Before announcing the move to Zion, he secretly bought up as much of the real estate in Zion as he could.   Along with making a fortune in real estate, he also forced his followers to put all their money in the Zion bank (which he owned).   As Dowie proudly proclaimed, his church would control every aspect of life in the new town.  "Our motto," he said, "is the unalterable and unassailable truth that where God rules, man prospers . . . our object, the establishment of the rule of God in every department of the government."   With the hold he had on the town, and the fortune he made from selling stock in various businesses in the town, Dowie quickly made himself one of the wealthiest men in America.
              </p>
              <p>
               What ultimately doomed Dowie, and gave Wilbur Glenn Voliva the chance to overthrow his rule over the church, was a stroke that he had in 1905.  With Dowie still recovering, Voliva arranged for an audit which determined that millions of dollars were missing from the accounts of the church.    Despite fighting back through litigation, Dowie was forced to step down and live on a pension until his death in 1907.   From that point on, it was Wilbur Voliva who was in control of Zion and the town flourished like never before.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not only did Voliva diversify the town's industries, including selling chocolates, lace, and other products, but the church stayed under his solid control.   As a one-company town, the people of Zion had no choice but to accept the wages that Voliva allowed, which were well below the standard set in other towns.  Instead of owning their homes outright, the people of Zion also had to pay for 1100-year leases  held by the Bank of Zion.   And it worked, at least economically.   Though Dowie's mismanagement had left the town bankrupt by the time of his death, Voliva created an economic boom in Zion.   Though he certainly had his share of critics,  many of whom tried to have him charged with  perjury and conspiracy, Voliva proved himself untouchable.
              </p>
              <p>
               But that would change in time...
              </p>
              <p>
               Along with being the main employer in town, Voliva also established stern guidelines for the kind of behaviour allowed in the town.  That meant banning alcohol, tobacco, playing cards, oysters, pork, and shellfish, among other things.  By pressuring the state legislature, Voliva even arranged for trains not to stop in Zion on Sundays.   But Voliva had more grandiose plans.  As a national advocate or the flat earth movement, he famously offered $5000 to anyone who could disprove the flat earth theory and also made the teaching of a flat earth and creationism mandatory in Zion schools.  His radio broadcasts preaching against modern astronomy and biology made him one of the most famous religious pundits of his time.   Referring to evolution, modern astronomy, and higher criticism as the "trinity of evils", Voliva's diatribes did little to change public opinion in the rest of the country, but he was still widely quoted.   Even after
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Richard Byrd's historic flight
               </a>
               over the Antarctic in 1928, newspapers were quick to publish Voliva's stern pronouncement that Byrd's flight did nothing to prove that the world was round.
              </p>
              <p>
               What really led to his undoing was his frequent pronouncements on the impending end of the world.   Coupled with boasting about the "wonders and miracles the the Lord would work in Zion", Voliva based his doomsday
               <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834523c1e69e201bb0789f2af970d-pi" style="float: right;">
                <img alt="Wilbur_Glenn_Voliva_(1911)[1]" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d834523c1e69e201bb0789f2af970d img-responsive" src="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834523c1e69e201bb0789f2af970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Wilbur_Glenn_Voliva_(1911)[1]"/>
               </a>
               predictions on calculations of key passages from the Book of Daniel.   As the Kingdom of Judah ended on October 6, 586 (how Voliva got the precise date was left up to speculation) then the world would come to a final end on that same day in 1943.   But the signs of the impending end of the world would begin long before then, Voliva predicted.   Prior to the world's ending, Benito Mussolini and "ten kings" would become absolute rulers of the Earth by 1936 and "you would not be able to buy or sell a cent's worth of anything unless you have his sign on your forehead."  But the faithful would have nothing to fear since "the Divine Ruler will appear above the Earth and draw His own up to Him."    He set various dates for when the Rapture would take place which newspapers dutifully reported.  But it was their gleeful reporting on the failure of Voliva's various prophecies that really sold newspapers.  On one promised date, September 10, 1934, Voliva and his followers gathered at Shiloh temple in Zion though they didn't seem to make any real preparation for the Rapture.   When nothing happened, Voliva simply argued that the true date of the Rapture would be on September 10, 1942 instead.
              </p>
              <p>
               Meanwhile however, the town and the companies that he had been controlling for so long were suffering from the effects of the Great Depression and all of Voliva's religious sermons failed to keep the townspeople from noticing. Residents in Zion began demanding changes to Voliva's autocratic rule, including the right to own their own property.
              </p>
              <p>
               Much like his predecessor, Voliva's lavish lifestyle helped force Zion Industries into bankruptcy.   His plans to revive the town's fortunes by establishing a Passion Play festival much like the one in Oberammergau failed when  a disgruntled employee burned down the theatre in 1937.    Soon afterward, Voliva was forced to declare personal bankruptcy (despite a personal forture once estimated to be around $5 million).
              </p>
              <p>
               Slowly, his once-absolute control of the town slipped away from him.    Despite blustering statements to the newspapers of being a "two-gun man" surrounded by armed guards, he suffered the humiliation of losing control of Zion Industries and seeing independents winning important political seats in Zion.   Trying to rebuild his financial base with  a series of paid lecture tours, he boasted to journalists that "all that riff-raff (in Zion), will come crawling back to me when I get the colony out of receivership.  Voliva is still on top and will be when prosperity returns to Zion."
              </p>
              <p>
               When the  people of Zion turned against him, Voliva shifted his base of operations to Florida where he hoped to establish a new religious colony.  This went nowhere and Voliva was forced to live on a pension from his  church in Zion.   Despite his confident predictions, the world never ended and life moved on for everyone but Voliva.   Following his death from cancer in 1942, the church that he had led for so long lost most of its followers.   Though the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Community_Church" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Christ Community Church
               </a>
               stilll exists, it has only a fraction of the adherents it had during the boom years in the early 20th century.   Even the "blue laws" that Voliva had passed in Zion barely survived his death.  The last of them were repealed by 1950.
              </p>
              <p>
               Today, Zion, Illinois has over 20,000 residents and seems little different than other towns its size.  That it was once the seat of a worldwide church empire, not to mention the home base of one of America's most colourful religious leaders seems to have been largely forgotten.   Still, both Alexander Dowie and Wilbur Glenn Voliva have had a powerful effect on Christian fundamentalism and many of the ideas they once championed live on in the religious crusades of modern evangelists (but mostly without the flat-earth beliefs that made Voliva so eccentric).
              </p>
              <p>
               So, the next time you listen to Pat Robertson or once of his fellow evangelists, spare a thought for Wilbur Glenn Voliva, the colourful autocrat who outcrazied them all.

               Social anxiety (SA) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the potential to affect an individual’s general psychological well-being and social functioning, however little research has explored factors associated with its development. A study published in the journal Neuropsychological Rehabilitation used hierarchical multiple regression to investigate the demographic, clinical and psychological factors associated with SA following TBI. A sample of 85 people who experienced TBI were recruited through social media websites and brain injury services across the North-West of England. The overall combined biopsychosocial model was significant, explaining 52–54.3% of the variance in SA (across five imputations of missing data). The addition of psychological variables (self-esteem, locus of control, self-efficacy) made a significant contribution to the overall model, accounting for an additional 12.2–13% of variance in SA above that explained by demographic and clinical variables. Perceived stigma was the only significant independent predictor of SA (
               <em>
                B
               </em>
               = .274,
               <em>
                p
               </em>
               = .005). The findings suggest that psychological variables are important in the development of SA following TBI and must be considered alongside clinical factors. Furthermore, the significant role of stigma highlights the need for intervention at both an individualised and societal level.

              Why Are Suicide Rates Increasing?
             </a>

              <p>
               Along with the recent suicides of Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade, media stories about suicide and suicide prevention have become more common than ever.  But a new study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that high-profile suicides like these may well be just the tip of the iceberg.
              </p>
              <p>
               As the study graphically demonstrates, suicide appears to be on the increase across the entire United States.  And this is a trend that appears to be occurring for all genders, racial, and ethnic groups.    In tracking suicide rates since 1999, the authors of the report state that nationwide suicide rates have jumped more than 25 percent between 1999 and 2016.    In 2016 alone, nearly 45,000 Americans took their lives with use of firearms accounting for two-thirds of these deaths.
              </p>
              <p>
               While lead researcher
               <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44416727">
                Dr. Deborah Stone stated in a recent media interview
               </a>
               that rate of suicide deaths fluctuated across the country, the highest rates appear to be in western and Midwestern regions of the country.   "There were 25 states that had increases of more than 30% - that was a new finding for us,"  she said.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the reasons behind this increase remains elusive.  While experts have proposed different possible explanations, including the lingering effects of the recent economic downturn, lack of proper mental health care, the easy availability of firearms, and the potential role of media stories relating to suicide in triggering copycat deaths, no one answer seems to fit the available facts.
              </p>
              <p>
               As Dr. Stone pointed out, grief, substance abuse, physical health, job and legal problems were all factors that have been cited in suicides though, again, there are no simple answers for this increase.   While mental illness is also commonly cited as a potential factor in suicides, the CDC study points out that 54 percent of all Americans who died by suicide had no known mental health issues.   Even though current statistics may be underestimating the true prevalence of mental illness, experts also point out that most people with known problems do not commit suicide and, while there does appear to be a significant link, focusing on mental illness alone may mean overlooking other causes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ultimately, preventing suicide is everybody's responsibility and helping people feel connected and needed may be the best way to curb these deaths.  People who feel at risk can also seek counseling to learn better ways of coping with stress, depression, or loneliness and to disrupt the thought processes that can make suicide possible.
              </p>
              <p>
               For people considering suicide, there are resources available that can help.   In the United States or Canada, getting help in an emergency is as simple as calling 911.   There is also the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1-800-273-8255 or accessing the Crisis Test Line by texting HOME to 741741.   In Canada, suicide prevention services can be found in all provinces.  Check the
               <a href="https://suicideprevention.ca/need-help/">
                Canadian Association For Suicide Prevention website
               </a>
               for more information.  For people based in the U.K., help is available through the
               <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">
                Samaritans

               What eventually became one of the most bizarre murder cases in Chicago's history began when 22-year-old Mary Vrzal first visited "The Great Billick, Card-Reader and Seer" in 1904.  Within a matter of months, most of her family would be dead and he would eventually be standing trial for their murder.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is little known about the early history of the man who called himself
               <a href="http://archive.is/Ylo2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Herman Billick
               </a>
               .   Born in what was then called Bohemia (later the Czech and Slovak republics) , his original name was Vajicek but he later changed it to Billick on emigrating to the United States (he wanted something easier for Americans to pronounce).    An all-around confidence artist, fortune-teller, and "mystic",  Billick developed a reputation for himself by dispensing fortunes, "messages" from the Great Beyond, and assorted quack nostrums, including love potions.    According to one account, Mary Vrzal visited Billick for a love potion to rekindle a local butcher's affection for her sister, Emma.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whatever the original reason for his coming into contact with the Vrzal family, he quickly discovered that the family had money and that was enough for "the Great Billick".  While not as well-educated as Billick, the family patriarch, Martin Vrzal, had built up a prosperous milk business, a comfortable nest egg, and a nice home on West 19th Street in Chicago
               <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834523c1e69e201a73da27247970d-pi" style="float: right;">
                <img alt="296e08c1e2029932f9930741b5ac6aae64ba4563[1]" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d834523c1e69e201a73da27247970d img-responsive" src="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834523c1e69e201a73da27247970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="296e08c1e2029932f9930741b5ac6aae64ba4563[1]"/>
               </a>
               that he shared with his wife and seven children.   It didn't take long for Herman Billick to ingratiate himself with Martin, his wife, Rosa, and the rest of their children.
              </p>
              <p>
               He began by visiting Martin at his milk business one day and suddenly speaking in tongues.   The sight of this well-spoken fellow-Czech proclaiming, "“You have an enemy. He is trying to destroy you” was enough to sway Martin to bringing "the Great Billick" home to meet the rest of his family.   Since Martin was already engaged in a fierce business battle with a rival milk producer, having Herman cast a spell to help his business seemed to make good business sense.   Though Mary Vrzal was already one of Billick's customers, it was Martin's wife, Rosa, who appeared to be his prime target.   Despite being married himself, Herman Billick apparently had no problem seducing Rosa and making her part of his bizarre murder scheme.
              </p>
              <p>
               Based on what would come out during Billick's later trial, he reportedly convinced Rosa Vrzal to help him poison his own wife and mother, as well as most of her own family to collect on their insurance policies.   After Billick's wife was dead, he would then be free to marry Rosa.    Exactly how Herman Billick was able to gain such complete control over Rosa Vrzal is still a mystery but members of her family began dropping like flies shortly afterward.   Martin Vrzal was the first to die on March 27, 1905.     The money Martin's insurance policy and the proceeds from selling their house both yielded a tidy $2000 but that was obviously not enough for Rosa and her new betrothed.    Just a few months later, Mary Vrzal died as well while a second daughter, Tilly, would die in December of that same year.   The insurance payout for both daughters was only $1400.    Two more daughters would die in the following year though their insurance payments would only pay out several hundred dollars apiece.
              </p>
              <p>
               But things were definitely going wrong for Rosa Vrzal.   Not only were the police taking a closer look at the suspicious deaths, but Herman Billick had pocketed all of the insurance money.   To add insult to injury, Billick's wife and mother were still alive since he refused to poison them as he had originally promised Rosa.   That meant that she was left destitute and without the marriage Billick had promised her.
              </p>
              <p>
               By December, 1906 police issued warrants for the arrest of Herman Billick and Rosa Vrzal.    All six bodies were exhumed and autopsies determined that they had  died of arsenic poisoning.   Though they were able to arrest Billick, Rosa managed to escape them by committing suicide with arsenic before the police could catch up with her.
              </p>
              <p>
               The trial of Herman Billick proved to be as bizarre as anyone could imagine.    The oldest Vrzal daughter,
               <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20910FE3C5512738DDDAE0894DA415B868CF1D3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Mrs. Emma Nieman
               </a>
               , testified that Billick had a "baneful influence" over her and her mother.  She told police that Billick had "drawn" the two of them to meet him in Cleveland, Ohio on one occasion.   He had also cabled the Vrzal family requesting money numerous times.   Demands for money often ran into hundreds of dollars at times and the Vrzal family were forced to borrow from their neighbours to raise the sum needed.    Emma also reported that Billick had personally dosed her father and sister with what he described as medication.   Since Emma's husband had been one of the victims, she came under suspicion as well though police later cleared her of all guilt.
              </p>
              <p>
               Martin and Rosa's son, Jerry, would testify that he had heard both Billick and Rosa scheming to murder his father in the days before his death.   He said that Billick seemed quite open about his murder scheme.   He also added that Billick said to him that, "...in a few days my father would be dead, and others also.   If I was all right, they would take me with them, he said.  Otherwise he would kill me."   As for Rosa's suicide, Jerry claimed that Billick had "hypnotized" her to kill herself as a way of protecting him from prosecution.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks to Jerry Vrzal's testimony. Herman Billick had no choice but to admit swindling the Vrzal family out of their savings but flatly denied having anything to do with the deaths.  While there was no evidence of his purchasing arsenic, Billick was sentenced to death for the murder of Mary Vrzal (the other charges were set aside).   His lawyer managed to win a stay of execution by appealing the sentence and promptly went to work trying to change public opinion about Billick's guilt.   Along with orchestrating news stories suggesting that Billick should be retried, Jerry Vrzal suddenly repudiated his own testimony, something which damaged the case severely.   Adding to that,  Billick not only denied any part in the poisonings but also to having any "sinful relationships" with Rosa Vrzal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then there was Chicago's large immigrant community to deal with.   A priest, Father P.J. O'Callaghan, and a nun, Sister Rose of the Order of the Sacred Heart, started a petition on Billick's behalf and gathered more than twenty-thousand signatures pleading for clemency in the case.   Even Billick's fellow prisoners got involved with over four hundred convicts in the Cork County Jail falling to their knees to "beg God to spare their popular fellow prisoner."    They then presented floral bouquets to the warden, Father O'Callaghan,  and Sister Rose.
              </p>
              <p>
               On June 12, 1908, the day of Billick's scheduled execution date,  thousands of people gathered outside the jail where Billick was being held.    Twenty minutes before the execution, presiding judge
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Kenesaw Mountain Landis
               </a>
               announced that he had found a flaw in the prosecutor's case.   While he was convinced Billick was guilty, he argued that there was ample grounds for an appeal.   "If I had the power to deny the appeal, I would deny it," he stated.  "However, it is not a question of merit, it is a question of right - hI have the right to stand between this man an a reconsideration of his plea.  I cannot find that I have any authority to do that."
              </p>
              <p>
               Hearing of Judge Landis' decision, the crowd outside the jail went hysterical.  Prisoners inside the jail staged their own demonstration and guards needed a half-hour to quiet them down.    Though Billick was spared the gallows, he was hardly a free man.    In January 1909, the Governor commuted his sentence to life imprisonment and, after years of serving as a model inmate, Herman Billick was formally pardoned in January, 1917.  Sadly, his story appears to end there., if there was anything more about his later life, I was unable to find it.

               Even for Boston in the 19th century, it was an unusually brutal murder.
              </p>
              <p>
               Based on police reports,  the murder occurred on October 27, 1845.   The victim, a 21-year-old prostitute named Maria Ann Bickford, had apparently just finished dealing with a client in the upscale "boarding house" (i.e., brothel) in Boston where she lived and worked.   Not only had she nearly been decapitated and her throat cut from ear to ear, but the killer had set several fires  in the brothel before leaving.   The fires had likely been set to conceal the crime but they were doued before long and Bickford's body was quickly discovered.  A man's vest and cane, covered with blood, were found at the scene.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since the landlord insisted that the house had been securely locked to prevent any intruders from getting in, police only had one real suspect in the killing.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Tirrell" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

               </a>
               was a twenty-two year-old paramour of Maria Bickford.    The son of a successful manufacturer and a member of a well-established family, Tirrell been living with his wife and two children in Weymouth, Massachusetts when he apparently grew tired of the domestic life.   Whether he had abandoned his family before or after meeting Maria Bickford in a Boston brothel isn't clear but they certainly became inseparable afterward.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maria Bickford's history was little different from Tirrell's.   Born and raised in Bangor, Maine, she had married a shoemaker at the age of sixteen and had one child who died in infancy.  Taken by friends to Boston to help her get over her grief,

                <img alt="Tirrell-Trial" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d834523c1e69e201b8d064a483970c img-responsive" src="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834523c1e69e201b8d064a483970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Tirrell-Trial"/>
               </a>
               she quickly became fascinated by Boston life and abandoned her husband after only three years of marriage.  Though she took up with a paramour, who then abandoned her, Bickford quickly turned to prostitution to support herself.   Her youthful beauty made her extremely popular and she quickly became established in brothels catering to the wealthy Boston elite.   Certainly, becoming Albert Tirrell's constant companion did nothing to change that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whether Tirrell was just her lover or Maria's pimp as well was never clear though they often traveled together moving from one new address to another.   Despite never marrying (they were both still legally married to other spouses),  Albert and Maria often posed as husband and wife as they stayed in some of the most fashionable hotels along the East Coast.    They also scandalized Boston society and Albert was even tried for adultery at one point (it took an impassioned plea from family members, including his young wife, to save him from prosecution).   He and Maria frequently quarreled but she would claim that she didn't mind because they had "such a good time making up."   Under the name "Maria Welch", she and Tirrell maintained a house on London street for a time.   That the house was basically a front for Maria to entertain clients was hardly a secret (Maria's name was on the front door).   Since prostitution was still technically illegal, despite Maria's exclusive clientele, they rarely stayed at any address for long.
              </p>
              <p>
               By the time of Maria's murder, she and Tirrell were both living at a thinly-disguised brothel in Boston.   An elderly couple ran the place and advertised it as a boarding-house but the fact that people rented the rooms for one purpose seemed clear enough.    Though Albert supposedly lived elsewhere, he stayed with Maria frequently and was known to have slept there on the night of her death.    Other residents on the house reported hearing loud noises coming from Maria's room early in the morning but nobody investigated until after the body was found.
              </p>
              <p>
               When police tried to question Tirrell about the murder, they found that he had disappeared.  Still, he was their only suspect since he had been seen with the victim earlier that night and was likely the last person to see her alive.    The bloody clothes that had been found in Bickford's room were identified as belonging to Tirrell.  Also, one witness had reported seeing Tirrell afterwards arguing with a livery stable keeper about getting a horse.   He had reportedly said that he was "in a scrape" and needed a horse and carriage as fast as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
               Albert Tirrell disappeared for months until Louisiana police, acting on a tip, arrested him on  a boat in the Gulf of Mexico on December 5.   As Boston police later learned,  Tirrell had driven to the home of some relatives in Weymouth, MA on the day of the murder.   These relatives had supplied him with money which he then used to flee to Canada.   From Montreal, he formed a convoluted plan to sail to Liverpool but bad weather eventually led to his sailing to New Orleans instead.  It was there that he was arrested and returned to Boston where  he was charged with the murder of Maria Bickford.

               While nobody could be certain who was responsible, a book titled
               <a href="http://www.questia.com/read/100922854/uneasy-virtue-the-politics-of-prostitution-and-the#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                <em>
                 The Life and Death of Mrs Maria Bickford
                </em>
               </a>
               was released shortly before the trial began.   The book, a largely fictionalized account of Maria Bickford's life up to the time of her murder, portrayed her as a beautiful and tragic figure who had been victimized by all the men in her life.   Though portraying Maria as a victim, the book also highlighted all of the stereotypes associated with prostitutes.   Despite claims of being "true to life", the book was largely fabricated and was obviously meant to capitalize on the publicity surrounding Tirrell's upcoming trial.   There is no evidence that any of the jurors in the trial actually read the book but it likely added to the media circus surrounding what promised to be a high-profile case.
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite the scandal that Tirrell brought to his family, they were well-to-do enough to hire
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Choate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Rufus Choate
               </a>
               to defend Albert in the lurid trial.   Choate, a prominent lawyer and politician, had already served both in Congress and as a Senator and was legendary for his skill as an orator.  Since virtually everybody in Boston knew about the overwhelming evidence against his client, thanks to the "scandal sheets" that described every detail of the case, Choate was obliged to try a different strategy to save his client.
              </p>
              <p>
               First of all, he attacked Maria Bickford's character to make her less sympathetic to the jurors.  Through evidence carefully orchestrated by Choate, Tirrell's cousins portrayed Maria Bickford as a shameless siren who had seduced poor Albert away from his wife and children.   They also claimed that she had a fatal hold on Albert and that she forced him to spend nearly all of his inherited wealth on buying her jewelry and dresses while she continued to throw herself at other men.   Despite this apparent abuse, Choate also insisted that his client would have had to be completely irrational to kill Maria due to his love for her.   As Choate pointed out, she had "for a long time had held him spellbound by her depraved and lascivious arts."   There was also a touch of racism added in as Choate also brought in two witnesses who testified that they had seen Maria with non-white clients (likely meant as proof of her "moral turpitude").  As a "fallen woman", anything Choate could say about Bickford must have seemed plausible enough to members of the jury, all of whom had seen the rise of urban prostitution in their lifetimes.
              </p>
              <p>
               To explain away the evidence against his client,  Choate and his defense team would do everything in their power to blacken Maria Bickford's reputation further and even suggesting that the wound to her throat had been self-inflicted.  He also broadly hinted that prostitutes were prone to committing suicide due to their immoral lifestyles.  But Rufus Choate didn't push this argument very far.   Considering that Maria had been nearly decapitated, arguing that she had done it to herself would have been too much for even a sympathetic jury to swalllow.  Not to mention the trifling problem of who had set the fire that nearly consumed her body.
              </p>
              <p>
               All of which led to his second great defense strategy:
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepwalking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                sleepwalking
               </a>
               .   Since somnabulism was still considered to be a mysterious phenomenon without a rational explanation, arguing that Choate must have committed the murder while in a trance state was a bold move on Choate's part.     As he stated in the courtroom, "Evidence will be produced to show that it had pleased Almighty God to afflict the prisoner with this species of mental derangement.”   That evidence included anecdotes from history including famous people such as Alexander the Great acting strangely while sleepwalking.    Family members and friends of the defendant also described episodes from Tirrell's life showing that he had been sleepwalking from a young age.     To cap off the testimony on Tirrell's behalf, Walter Channing, dean of Harvard Medical School, testified that it was theoretically possible for a man to commit murder while sleepwalking.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whether it was the character assassination of the victim or the novel sleepwalking defense, Choate's ploy worked.   Really though, it was his own amazing skill at rhetoric that truly swayed the jury on his client's behalf.  Even the court stenographer recording Choate's arguments during the trial complained that she had difficulty keeping up with him.  "Who can report chain lightning?",  she reportedly said.
              </p>
              <p>
               It took only two hours for the jurors to hand down a not-guilty verdict.   Spectators applauded and Albert Tirrell burst into tears.   Of course, his legal problems were hardly over.  He still had to stand trial for arson (which was also a capital crime at the time) but Choate got him off on that charge as well.
               <a href="http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/rufus-choate-wins-trial-century-sleepwalking-defense/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                According to historical record,
               </a>
               Tirrell later unsuccessfully tried to get Choate to refund half his legal fees because "his innocence was so obvious."  Not that Tirrell escaped justice completely.   The judge refused to acquit him on the charge of adultery and he eventually spent three years in a state prison.   From what I could find, he vanished into well-deserved obscurity after his release.   Whether he ever went back to his long-suffering family doesn't seem to be recorded.
              </p>
              <p>
               Afterward, Choate left private practice to return to public office (after being reportedly besieged by defendants hoping he could help them as well).   Despite his reputation as a statesman, Rufus Choate never quite lived down being the one to introduce the sleepwalking defense.   Following his death in 1859,
               <a href="http://www.murderbygaslight.com/2011/01/sleepwalking-defense.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                one lawyer eulogized him
               </a>
               by saying that Choate was "the lawyer who made it safe to murder."
              </p>
              <p>
               Miscarriage of justice or not?  You be the judge.

               Electronic (E-) cigarettes are one of the most popular tobacco products used by adolescents today. A new study in the journal
               <em>
                Addictive Behaviors
               </em>
               examined whether exposure to advertisements in (1) social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest/Google Plus), (2) traditional media (television/radio, magazines, billboards), or (3) retail stores (convenience stores, mall kiosks, tobacco shops) was associated with subsequent e-cigarette use in a longitudinal cohort of adolescents. Data were drawn from longitudinal surveys conducted in fall 2013 (wave 1) and spring 2014 (wave 2) of a school-based cohort attending 3 high schools and 2 middle schools in Connecticut. Adolescents were asked about tobacco use behaviors and where they had recently seen e-cigarette advertising at wave 1. We used logistic regression to determine whether advertising exposure at wave 1 increased the odds of e-cigarette use by wave 2, controlling for demographics and cigarette smoking status at wave 1.  Among those who have never used e-cigarettes in wave 1 (n = 1742), 9.6% reported e-cigarette use at wave 2. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that exposure to e-cigarette advertising on Facebook (OR 2.12 = p &lt; 0.02) at wave 1, but not other venues, significantly increased the odds of subsequent e-cigarette use wave 2. Age, white race, and cigarette smoking at wave 1 also was associated with e-cigarette use at wave 2. This study provides one of the first longitudinal examinations demonstrating that exposure to e-cigarette advertising on social networking sites among youth who had never used e-cigarettes increases the likelihood of subsequent e-cigarette use.

               Ebola hemorrhagic fever (or simply "Ebola" for short) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases known.
              </p>
              <p>
               With symptoms starting as early as two days following exposure, Ebola has killed up to 90 percent of all those infected and is spread by contact with bodily fluids, either directly or indirectly.  Since first being identified in 1976, there have been over 24 outbreaks of Ebola with the worst of these outbreaks occurring  in West Africa between 2013 and 2016.  Over this three-year period, more than 28,000 people were infected with over 11,000 deaths.
              </p>
              <p>
               The latest outbreak is now occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) making it the ninth in that country's history.   Despite warnings from WHO officials that the disease could spread to urban areas and that the world is on an epidemiological knife edge”, efforts at combating this latest outbreak are being blocked by widespread fears that Ebola has a supernatural cause.   While health workers are attempting to introduce a prototype vaccine that may prevent further deaths, many victims are escaping hospital quarantine to seek out exorcisms from traditional healers and evangelical preachers.
              </p>
              <p>
               In a recent media interview, Nurse Julie Lobali, who works in a hospital in Mandaka and is on the frontlines of the outbreak said "Some sick people believe that the Ebola epidemic comes from sorcery - they refuse to be treated and prefer to pray.”  She also reported on a widespread belief that Ebola began as "a curse on those who ate stolen meat."   While bush meat (meat from wild game, including chimps and gorillas) continues to be sold in many rural areas, a recurring rumour that "a hunter put a curse on the village because his big game was stolen".  Along with spreading stories about the curse, some villagers are claiming that the government has warned that the Ebola epidemic is incurable due to being caused by witchcraft.
              </p>
              <p>
               To combat this rumour and to help the efforts of health officials to contain the outbreak, the health ministry is planning to send anthropologists to parts of the DRC to reassure people that Ebola isn't caused by witchcraft.  But WHO officials also warn that the Ebola epidemic is entering a critical stage.  "The next few weeks will really tell if this outbreak is going to expand to urban areas or if we're going to be able to keep it under control,"
               <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/964075/ebola-virus-congo-outbreak-pandemic-exorcism-witchcraft">

               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Part of the problem is the superstitious fear that many Africans have concerning a disease as deadly as Ebola.  According to Zacharie Bababaswe, a Congolese specialist in cultural history,  “so many deaths is a sign of a curse and can only have been provoked by a bad spirit”.  With many local evangelists claiming supernatural powers of healing, people exposed to Ebola continue to risk their lives, and the lives of the purported healers, by relying on remedies that they are more comfortable receiving.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the meantime, the number of Ebola deaths continues to rise and health professionals on the front lines remain frustrated at the skepticism they face from potential victims.

               “Do not seek for the best partner, but seek for the person who makes you a better version of yourself.”  Abhijit Naskar
              </p>
              <p>
               Though we tend to think of personality as something fixed and permanent, it does change over time, often as a result of the various life transitions that will occur as we go from being children to taking on adult roles.  According to research looking at the social investment principle, personality can change depending on how invested we are in new roles that we take on over time, whether it involves a new job, new responsibilities, or a new relationship.   And one of the most important of these life transitions occurs when people get married.   For newlyweds in particular, making that shift from single status to a new role as a spouse with all the responsibilities that go with that role can be a sobering experience.
              </p>
              <p>
               As a result, it's hardly surprising that many married couples find the first few months or years of marriage to be fairly rocky.   With the expectation of wedded bliss giving way to a more realistic view of what  married life can mean, men and women often find themselves making compromises and generally changing long-established patterns of thinking and behaving.   But do these changes also mean changes in basic personality traits?   While numerous studies have already been carried out looking at personality differences between married couples and their single or divorced counterparts, actual research into the kind of personality changes that can occur in the early stages of marriage have been relatively scarce up to now.

               For Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, it was a straightforward matter of protecting their troops from venereal disease.   For everyone else, well, not so much.
              </p>
              <p>
               Having a pathological fear of syphilis (which he likely had himself), the Fuhrer was determined to ensure that the Germans serving under him could indulge themselves without the risk of infection.  And infection was a legitimate risk as it was.   Following the occupation of France, the French brothels were a prime breeding ground for the kind of diseases that could remove a soldier from active duty.   In a letter written by Heinrich Himmler on November 20, 1940, he stated that:  "The greatest danger in Paris is the widespread and uncontrolled presence of whores, picking up clients in bars, dance halls, and other places.  It is our duty to prevent soldiers from risking their health just for the sake of a quick adventure."
               <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-Who-Shot-Lincoln/dp/1849081700/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397395662&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=graeme+donald" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Sources have pointed out
               </a>
               that French prostitutes infecting German soldiers accounted for more losses than many divisions of the Allied Forces.
              </p>
              <p>
               To counter this threat to German health, Himmler and Hitler launched what would be known as the
               <a href="http://www.borghild.de/indexe.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Borghild Project
               </a>
               in 1941.   Designated "more secret than top secret", the project was run by Himmler's commander-in-chief,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Mrugowsky" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                Dr. Joachim Mrurgowsky
               </a>
               of the notorious SS Institute.  The purpose of the project was to create what was essentially the world's first sex doll for German troops to use instead of prostitutes.   With a team of craftsmen from the Hygiene Museum in Dresden, Germany, the work was overseen by chief technician Franz Tschakert whose "Woman of Glass" had astounded visitors to the Museum's International Hygiene Exhibit years earlier.   Himmler concluded that only Tschakert could create the kind of doll that would be needed for the project.
              </p>
              <p>
               Though Mrurgowsky was later replaced by a Danish doctor named Olen Hannussen, the project continued with full Nazi support.  According to surviving documents, the plan was to create "galvanoplastical dolls" that could be easily disinfected and stored in hygienic trailers that would follow German troops as they moved into new territories.   It was Himmler's intention that the dolls could replace the "loose women" and brothels that he viewed as a prime risk for infection.  While the project may have seemed reasonable enough to Heinrich though, his underlings weren't quite so convinced of its practicality.
              </p>
              <p>
               In a letter written by a
               <a href="http://www.borghild.de/indexe.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                psychiatrist friend of Hannussen
               </a>
               who was also involved in the project,  the challenges that needed to be overcome to make the sex dolls feasible were summed up in the following way:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                <em>
                 ”Sure thing, purpose and goal of the dolls is to relieve our soldiers. They have to fight and not be on the browl or mingle with ”foreign womenfolk”. However:  no real men will prefer a doll to a real woman, until our technicians meet the following quality standards-
                </em>
               </p>
               1.
               <em>
                The synthetic flesh has to feel the same like real flesh
               </em>
               <p>
                <em>
                 2.      The doll’ s body should be as agile and moveable as the real body
                </em>
               </p>
               <p>
                <em>
                 3.      The doll’s organ should feel absolutely realistic.”
                </em>
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               The moralistic bent underlying the project was apparent from the beginning.   As Hannussen wrote in his logbook,  "
               <em>
                The doll has only one purpose and she should never become a substitute for the honourable mother at home... When the soldier makes love to Borghild, it has nothing to do with love. Therefore the face of our anthropomorphic sexmachine should be exactly how Weininger described the common  wanton’s face.”
               </em>
               The team put in charge of actually developing the dolls included Tschakert, his protege Arthur Rink (who was the chief sculptor), various technicians, and a hairstylist.   Using a plastic framework, they created a synthetic skin that was intended to be easily cleaned by common antiseptics.   Despite Himmler's sponsorship, getting the necessary materials during wartime wasn't easy but Tshakert and his team persevered.
              </p>
              <p>
               Among other design innovations, Olen Hannussen felt that the dolls needed to have a "rose hip form that would grip well" and that the face of the doll should have a "

               ."  A Hungarian actress,

                Kathe von Nagy
               </a>
               , was initially approached by Himmler to be the model for the doll but she declined the "honour."   Instead, the dolls were made as blue-eyed blondes to "comfort" the troops as well as giving them the proper "Nordic look".    As for the actual body, Tschakert invited a number of famous women athletes to come to his studios but despaired of finding the perfect body among them.   As he told his superiors,
               <em>
                ”Sometimes the legs are too short and look deformed, or the lady has a hollow back and arms  like a wrestler. The overall appearance is always dreadful and I fear there is no other way than to combine.”
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               As for Arthur Rink, he was charged with creating "ten wanton faces" that were then tested by the team psychiatrist, Rudolf Chargeheime, to find the one that men would find most attractive.  Chargeheimer and Hannussen felt that it was not enough for the face to be attractive, it also needed to have the "right" facial expression.   Unfortunately, as Chargeheimer wrote to Hannussen, "the idea of beauty harboured by the SS might not be shared by the majority of our soldiers.”    Exactly how Chargeheimer tested the different faces on German soldiers isn't recorded but his methodology must have been something to see.  Even the hair that would be on the dolls was hotly disputed.   While the hairdresser favoured a more natural German look, Hannussen insisted that the doll should have a 'boyish hairdo" since the doll was a "field-whore" who was "part of the fighting forces" rather than an honourable mother.
              </p>
              <p>
               The dolls were intended to come in three models that varied according to breast size:  168 cm, 176 cm, and 182 cm.   The first model produced in September 1941 was overwhelmingly approved by Himmler when it was presented to him in Berlin.   After carefully examining the doll's various orifices, Himmler ordered fifty more on the spot.    Since Tschakert's Dresden studio was too small to meet the demand for fifty dolls, let alone the hundreds of dolls that would eventually be needed, plans were made to create a special production facility for mass production.
              </p>
              <p>
               Which was where things stalled for the Borhild Project.   There were other military priorities given the realities of the war and Himmler dropped plans for the expanded facility a week later.   Instead, he cut the budget.   As Arthur Rink would later report, "The bronze model for Type B (the only one that reached the final stage) was never completed.  I have no idea as to the whereabouts of the doll but I presume that she, like all my plaster and studies, was sent to Berlin.   If she was kept in Dresden it is most likely she was destroyed in the Allied bombing of that city."
              </p>
              <p>
               By the beginning of 1942, the entire Borghild project was cancelled.   According to rumour, the concept of sex dolls faced heavy resistance from the actual German soldiers, none of whom seemed mesmerized by the prospect of "doll brothels".   All traces of the Borghild Project vanished as Hitler and Himmler moved on to other matters.    Any remaining evidence was destroyed by  t

               which also heavily damaged the Hygiene Museum itself, including two versions of Tschakert's Woman of Glass masterpiece.

              <p>
               So, why weren't condoms issued instead to avoid the problem of sexually transmitted diseases?
              </p>
              <p>
               One possible reason may have been the perception that condoms were a Jewish innovation.   It was Polish-Jewish entrepreneur

                Julius Fromm
               </a>
               who had first invented the cement dipping method for making seamless condoms from chemically treated rubber
               <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834523c1e69e201a73db4f342970d-pi" style="float: right;">

               (and now you know why they're called "rubbers").   After patenting his invention in 1916, Fromm founded an international condom industry, including building the first condom vending machine.   While the Nazis forced Fromm to sell them his factories in 1938 (he had become a German citizen by this time), the factories were either destroyed or retooled for the war effort.     If condoms were used at all, they were used grudgingly and with no support from the Nazi hierarchy (having children was the Aryan way, after all).   Not until after the end of World War II was Fromm's family able to relaunch their condom business.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whether or not it was the "Jewishness" of condoms that led to the launch of the Borghild Project, the Nazi sex doll never materialized.  Still, and perhaps not coincidentally, the 30cm

               </a>
               doll, based on a popular German cartoon became all the rage in Germany following the war.   An X-rated item, the dolls were mainly sold in bars and clubs as a gag gift.   That is, until Mattel founder Ruth Handler, purchased several Bild Lilli dolls while visiting Europe.  While Handler and her husband likely didn't realize the erotic nature of the doll at first, they eventually released their own, less busty, version under the name
               <em>
                Barbie
               </em>
               .    Naturally enough, the company owning the Bild Lilli trademark eventually sued for copyright infringement though they lost the case.   Those few Bild Lilli dolls still around are now extremely valuable collector's items while Barbie dolls are sold worldwide.
              </p>
              <p>
               If any of the surviving members of the Borghild project took notice,  they likely got a good laugh out of that.

               The celebration that greeted the end of World War II in 1945 was naturally tempered by sadness over the millions of lives lost during the war.  But along with mourning the war dead, people around the world also had to face the enormous challenges of dealing with the thousands of survivors liberated from German and Japanese internment camps, many of whom had endured years of torture and abuse.    While the logistics of caring for Allied soldiers and civilians who had been prisoners of war was daunting enough, there were also the members of the various persecuted minorities that had faced the Holocaust, many of whom had lost their entire families as well as surviving nightmarish treatment in the death camps.

               ) had become recognized in the clinical literature (grudgingly), the symptoms these former prisoners were displaying seemed disturbingly different.    This included premature aging, visual impairments, extreme weight loss, abnormal liver functioning, bronchitis, emphysema, and tuberculosis.  Many also had evidence of severe physical trauma including fractures, and internal bleeding.  Along with the physical symptoms,  there were also a disturbing array of psychiatric symptoms as well   Many former prisoners complained of chronic depression, sleep problems, nightmares, loss of pleasure, irritability, and exaggerated startle reactions.  Problems with memory and concentration were present as well as psychosomatic symptoms such as anorexia, panic disorder, and autonomic symptoms of anxiety (rapid heart rate,  sweating, and palpitations).  The combination of symptoms in former prisoners became common enough to be identified in the clinical literature under a variety of names including "concentration camp syndrome", "concentration camp survivor syndrome", "repatriation neurosis", or
               <em>
                KZ syndrome

               Although the establishment of the Geneva Convention was meant to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners of war during wartime, the 20th century has seen a range of brutal conflicts with continuing breaches of international law.  But there were also differences in how the kind of trauma reported by former prisoners.  American soldiers who had been prisoners of war in German internment camps showed relatively few psychological problems since the Nazis tended to comply with the Geneva Convention for Allied prisoners (albeit under pressure from international aid groups).

              <p>
               Soldiers interned in Japanese camps, however, were a different story.  Since Japanese military tradition regarded soldiers who allowed themselves to be taken prisoner with contempt, Allied prisoners of war often faced severe abuse (including being subjected to

               found mortality rates, including  deaths from tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer and suicide, to be far higher rate than comparison subjects of equivalent age who had not been prisoners.  Similar findings were obtained by researchers examining soldiers who had been prisoners

               .   For former prisoners,  violent accidents, suicide. and murder accounted for more than 50% of total mortality.

               Reentry into society has been characteristically difficult for returning prisoners, especially those who had been interned in Japanese and Korean camps since medical professionals were poorly equipped to deal with KZ syndrome (which was still relatively unknown).   In addition to severe disorientation relating to attempt reintegration into peacetime, returning soldiers showed high rates of unemployment and failure to adapt to work environments with severe impairments in vocational and social adjustment.  Children of former prisoners also reported emotional problems stemming from dealing with one or both parents suffering from KZ syndrome and clinical research into

               </a>
               has demonstrated the long-term persistence that such trauma can have.   While KZ syndrome has often been linked to posttraumatic stress disorder, especially in terms of proneness to flashbacks, irritability, and exaggerated startle reactions. former prisoners also displayed additional symptoms including pervasive depression and survivor guilt.

               Survivors of the Holocaust also displayed a characteristic set of psychiatric problems which were often linked to the horrors they faced in the camps.  There have been thousands of research studies outlining the psychological consequences of their internment and later reintegration into post-war society.   Survivors reporting on their experiences in the camps tended to identify lingering issues stemming from the constant fear of their lives that they experienced, as well as physical trauma resulting from beatings, hunger, and forced labour.    Survivor guilt was an additional factor given that most prisoners lost family members and friends leaving them with the feeling that they had been wrongly spared while more worthy victims died.  Since many prisoners often engaged in whatever acts they deemed necessary for survival (including stealing food or cooperating with their captors), an additional burden of guilt was often added.  Along with harsh treatment, prisoners were typically subjected to severe indoctrination designed to justify the genocidal policies and reinforce the idea that they deserved to die.  That survivors were left with deep psychological scarring wasn't surprising.  Some Israeli researchers later reported an extremely high incidence of psychiatric disorders among Holocaust survivors which typically persisted for decades in many cases.   Ironically,  inmates with preexisting psychiatric problems were typically the first to be killed (in keeping with

              <p>
               What seemed more surprising for clinicians dealing with Holocaust survivors was the resilience that many survivors showed in dealing with their ordeal.  Despite early pessimism  concerning eventual recovery,

               </a>
               have shown evidence of good adaptation in dealing with posttraumatic symptoms.  In addition to provided powerful testimony concerning their experiences, survivors such as

                Elie Wiesel
               </a>
               have inspired generations of readers with their writing.   The resilience shown by Holocaust survivors does not immunize them from later health problems, however.  While specialized treatment programs (especially in Israel) have helped Holocaust survivors to lead relatively normal lives, their vulnerability to later stress situations, such as

                hospitalization
               </a>
               and diseases of old age, remains the focus of clinical research.
              </p>
              <p>
               Along with new conflicts came a new generation of prisoners of war who often showed the same symptoms seen in their WWII counterparts.  During the long Vietnam war especially, returning prisoners of war became a much more common phenomenon.  The range of presenting symptoms these former prisoners displayed often varied according to where in Vietnam they had been held captive.   Prisoners held by the Vietcong in the North tended to be less harshly treated and had a lower mortality rate than those who had been held in the South.   It also helped that the North Vietnamese were more likely to regard their prisoners as potentially valuable hostages which made them less likely to engage in torture or systematic extermination. While it was standard practice for all returning prisoners to have a complete medical and psychosocial examination upon their return to the United States, prisoners from North Vietnam seemed relatively fit and healthy regardless of the length of their captivity. Prisoners from South Vietnam, however, often had severe physical and psychological disabilities which tended to persist long after their release.
              </p>
              <p>
               Research studies identified various protective factors that seemed to play a role in helping prisoners survive.  They included a strong motivation to live, well-controlled or balanced sensitivity, a sense of humour, assertiveness, and an action-oriented coping style.   Being able to deal with solitary confinement also represented a critical coping strategy, whether through communicating with other captives, physical activity, mental exercises, or the planning of escapes.    Still, it was the necessity of providing better mental health care for thousands of returning Vietnam veterans (many of whom had been prisoners of war) and political pressure from veterans groups that led to the addition of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#DSM-III_.281980.29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                posttraumatic stress disorder
               </a>
               in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980.  Since then, thousands of U.S. veterans have been granted disability benefits for PTSD-related conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
               As new conflicts break out worldwide, the lessons learned from former prisoners or war and Holocaust survivors seem more relevant than ever.    Providing psychological counseling for refugees scarred by their own experiences with torture and imprisonment remains a challenge that

               .  Helping people in need to reenter society and come to terms with what they have endured is a challenge we are just beginning to face.
