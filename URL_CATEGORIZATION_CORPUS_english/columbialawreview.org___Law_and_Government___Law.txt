           The SEC’s recent—and controversial—choice to make more frequent use of internal enforcement actions has raised several questions. Some have asked whether the SEC has attempted to advantage itself by prosecuting in-house; others have asked whether the SEC’s internal enforcement scheme is unconstitutional. This Note asks a largely over­looked threshold question: Do—and just as importantly, should—federal district courts have parallel[...]

There has been, unsurprisingly, a dramatic outpouring of industry backlash to the SEC\u2019s choice to take advantage of this legislative change.[footnote]See, e.g., Jean Eaglesham, SEC Wins with In-House Judges, Wall St. J. (May 6, 2015), http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/sec-wins-with-in-house-judges-1430965803 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) [hereinafter Eaglesham, In-House Judges]; Gretchen Morgenson, Crying Foul on Plans to Expand the S.E.C.\u2019s In-House Court System, N.Y.

For the pertinent Dodd-Frank provisions, see Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, \u00a7\u00a0929P(a), 124 Stat. 1376, 1862 (2010).[\/footnote] Practitioners have raised a range of constitutional challenges to these proceedings, arguing, among other things, that ALJs are not appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause or that the procedural lim\u00aditations of the SEC administrative proceedings do not meet due process requirements.[footnote]See Alexander I. Platt, SEC Administrative Proceedings: Backlash and Reform, 71 Bus. Law. 1, 12\u201314 (2016) [hereinafter Platt, Backlash] (cataloguing both Due Process and Appointments Clause challenges); see also Sarah A. Good &amp; Laura C.

Law., Feb. 2017, at 30, 32\u201333 (\u201cCritics contend that the administrative arena lacks many of the due process protections of the federal courts, including an independently appointed judiciary, the opportunity for extensive discovery, and juries.\u201d); Vedder Price, SEC Administrative Proceedings Under Constitutional Scrutiny, Sec.

Stippich, Constitutional and Strategic Considerations Regarding SEC Enforcement Actions Following Dodd-Frank, <em>in <\/em>New Developments in Securities Litigation *3 (2016 ed.), 2016 WL 2989433 (\u201cThese cases\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. involve streamlined proceedings where the target of the government\u2019s enforcement action has no ability to take depositions, has highly limited document discovery, no Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, and\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the rules of evidence and civil procedure do not apply.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMuch of the scholarship to date has focused either on gamesmanship considerations, that is, questioning whether the SEC has created for itself a strategic prosecutorial advantage by bringing cases in front of its in-house judges, or alternatively, on the merits of the various constitutional challenges to the in-house proceedings.[footnote]See, e.g., Linda J. Jellum &amp; Moses M. Tincher, The Shadow of Free Enterprise: The Unconstitutionality of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Administrative Law Judges, 70 SMU L. Rev. 3, 33\u201360 (2017) (arguing that the appointment and removal processes for SEC ALJs violate the Constitution); Alexander I.

See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7\u00a01 (\u201cThe Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\u201d).[\/footnote] from exercising parallel jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to the administrative proceeding itself, <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v.

See Tilton v. SEC, 137 S. Ct. 29, 29 (2016) (denying certiorari); see also <em>Tilton v.

See, e.g., Lisa Lambert &amp; Sarah N. Lynch, Trump May Already Have a Plan Ready to Revamp Dodd-Frank, Reuters (Nov. 11, 2016), http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-election-trump-doddfrank-idUSKBN1361X0 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/NLR6-QJME] (discussing Trump\u2019s public indications of intent to weaken Dodd-Frank). In the summer of 2017, the Trump Administration released a 150-page report that took steps to weaken several key elements of Dodd-Frank, calling for the severe limitation of the so-called \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d and the curtailment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s (CFPB) enforcement capabilities (including a requirement that the CFPB prosecute its actions in federal court rather than via administrative proceedings). See U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities: Banks and Credit Unions 71\u201392 (2017), http:\/\/www.treasury.gov\/press-center\/press-releases\/Documents\/A%20Financial%20System.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/587F-VCWA]. However, as of this writing, the Trump Administration has neither materially changed nor threatened to materially change the SEC\u2019s internal enforcement apparatus. See generally id. (providing recommendations for reforming the U.S. financial system according to Trump\u2019s announced \u201cCore Principles\u201d but not suggesting changes to the SEC\u2019s internal enforcement mechanisms). Were Dodd-Frank to be eliminated in any meaningful capacity vis-\u00e0-vis SEC administrative proceedings, this would of course change the climate surrounding many of the issues addressed herein. However, the questions would remain of how and whether Article III courts exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to administrative proceedings, inside and outside of the SEC, and whether this provides a desirable check on administrative agencies.[\/footnote] is (1) a doctrinally dubious application of the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors, as it excises the \u201cmeaningful\u201d from \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d; (2) concern\u00ading insofar as it constrains the ability of Article III courts to develop admin\u00adistrative and constitutional law; and (3) undesirable as a policy matter in that it significantly hinders the ability of parties to challenge purported SEC constitutional violations, undercutting the legitimacy of the SEC at a time when skepticism toward the Commission and its enforcement strat\u00adegy runs relatively high.[footnote]The current skepticism arguably applies to the administrative state writ large, but even among critics of the administrative state, the SEC seems of late to attract particularly acute criticism. See, e.g., Ilan Wurman,\u00a0Constitutional Administration, 69 Stan. L. Rev. 359, 372 (2017) (\u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is perhaps the worst offender, routinely bringing enforcement actions in front of its own judges, who rarely rule against the SEC.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Note proposes two responses, one legislative and the other doc\u00adtrinal. Legislatively, the SEC or (ideally) Congress should promulgate binding and detailed forum selection guidelines for enforcement actions. Doctrinally, Article III courts that have yet to rule on this ques\u00adtion should employ standard injunction analysis, exercising jurisdiction over the constitutional claims and gauging the likelihood of success on the merits of those claims.[footnote]For a discussion of two recent district court opinions employing standard injunction analysis, see infra section III.B. By \u201cstandard injunction analysis,\u201d this Note refers to the framework routinely employed by federal courts determining whether or not injunctive relief is appropriate as an equitable matter, that is, by asking \u201cwhether Plaintiff (1) is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim, (2) will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, and (3) the public interest weighs in favor of granting the injunction.\u201d Duka v. SEC, 103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), abrogated by <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d 276.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe first proposal will help mitigate the industry uproar by improv\u00ading the transparency of SEC reasoning regarding forum selection and will encourage much-needed discussion regarding the types of cases that should properly be brought in each forum, that is, the administrative law court or Article III body. The second proposal will ensure that those prosecuted by the SEC have a meaningful opportunity for judicial review of their constitutional and administrative law claims in the district court while also weeding out frivolous defensive tactics camouflaged as consti\u00adtutional challenges.[footnote]From the outset, it is important to note that the proposals made herein are not without cost. Opening the door to threshold constitutional challenges may force enough expense upon the SEC in the form of litigation and transactional costs that the SEC will refuse to bring cases internally altogether, thereby disrupting or even dismantling the administrative scheme itself. See infra section III.B.3.[\/footnote] Allowing district courts to exercise jurisdiction over parallel constitutional challenges to SEC administrative proceedings will act as a prophylactic mechanism, cautioning the SEC against engaging in unconstitutional behavior, reassuring the industry that legitimate consti\u00adtutional violations will be subject to meaningful review, and preventing important questions of administrative and constitutional law from being decided outside Article III courts.\r\n\r\nPart I of this Note provides background on the SEC\u2019s use of internal enforcement actions and describes the doctrinal framework governing subject matter jurisdiction in cases challenging the constitutionality of ongoing administrative proceedings. Part I directs special attention to the tension between allowing meaningful Article III court review of chal\u00adlenges to administrative proceedings and reluctance to allow such challenges to disrupt congressionally enacted administrative schemes.[footnote]See infra section I.B.2 (discussing how the doctrines of administrative preclusion and exhaustion help courts navigate this tension and how these doctrines relate to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>). This tension largely animates the line of cases discussed in Part II.[\/footnote] Part II catalogues the recent line of cases refusing to exercise subject matter jurisdiction and then discusses in detail the reasoning in and impli\u00adcations of the Second Circuit\u2019s split <em>Tilton <\/em>decision. Part III outlines potential solutions to the problems identified in Parts I and II.\r\n<h2>I. Overview of the Legislative and Doctrinal Framework<\/h2>\r\nThis Part provides an overview of the legislative and doctrinal back\u00adground governing judicial consideration of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in constitutional challenges to ongoing administrative pro\u00adceedings, with a focus on the SEC, SEC ALJs, and SEC in-house proceed\u00adings. Section I.A offers a description of SEC in-house enforcement capabilities before and after Dodd-Frank, with a short subsection devoted to correcting some common misconceptions about the SEC ALJs tasked with overseeing SEC administrative proceedings. Section I.B then turns to the doctrinal framework used by Article III courts to determine whether an exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is appropriate.\r\n<h3>A. SEC Administrative Proceedings Before and After Dodd-Frank<\/h3>\r\nThis section briefly discusses the ways in which Dodd-Frank altered the SEC enforcement landscape.[footnote]For a thorough review of the SEC\u2019s institutional development, see generally Paul S. Atkins &amp; Bradley J. Bondi, Evaluating The Mission: A Critical Review of the History and Evolution of the SEC Enforcement Program, 13 Fordham J. Corp. &amp; Fin. L. 367 (2008). For a more targeted examination of the SEC\u2019s expansion of power via Dodd-Frank, see Giles D. Beal IV, Judge, Jury, and Executioner: SEC Administrative Law Judges Post-Dodd Frank, 20 N.C. Banking Inst. 413, 413 (2016) (\u201cDodd-Frank extended SEC ALJs\u2019 ability to levy civil penalties on non-registered individuals and entities, while simultaneously expanding the range of penalties available to ALJs in administrative hearings.\u201d).[\/footnote] The intent here is not to exhaustively chronicle changes to the SEC\u2019s regulatory apparatus but rather to high\u00adlight several modifications that have stoked industry ire and raised an array of constitutional eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether or not to grant exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to SEC administrative proceedings can appear to be a trivial or anomalous feature of a recent string of circuit cases, unless one appreciates the extent to which Dodd-Frank expanded SEC discretion and emboldened the Commission to prosecute in-house. In order to avoid muddying the waters of this discussion, this section simply provides a targeted snapshot of SEC administrative proceedings before (section I.A.1) and after (section I.A.2) Dodd-Frank\u2014rather than investigating the interim dynamics that catalyzed these changes\u2014before briefly addressing several common misconceptions regarding the nature of the ALJs tasked with overseeing these internal adjudications (section I.A.3). Section I.B then explains how the changes introduced by Dodd-Frank intersect with the doctrinal framework governing the question of exclu\u00adsive subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n1. <em>SEC Administrative Proceedings Before Dodd-Frank.<\/em> \u2014 Even before Dodd-Frank, the SEC was authorized under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and subsequent rules and amendments thereto, to pursue internal administrative proceedings as an alternative to bringing enforce\u00adment actions in federal district court.[footnote]See Joseph A. Grundfest, Fair or Foul?: SEC Administrative Proceedings and Prospects for Reform Through Removal Legislation, 85 Fordham L. Rev. 1143, 1145 n.4 (2016) [hereinafter Grundfest, Fair or Foul] (\u201cThe SEC has used administrative proceedings as an alternative to federal court litigation since the SEC\u2019s inception.\u201d); Tessa Stillings, Are the SEC\u2019s Administrative Law Courts Constitutional?: Recent Developments in the SEC\u2019s Increased Use of Administrative Proceedings, 35 Rev. Banking &amp; Fin. L. 96, 97 (2015) (\u201cThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. created the SEC and gave the agency the power to \u2018bring \u201cadministrative proceedings\u201d against regulated persons or entities who are alleged violators of the securities laws.\u2019\u201d (quoting Robert N.

The Supreme Court held early on that the SEC is permitted to develop new regulatory rules via these internal adjudications. See, e.g., SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947) (\u201cHence we refuse to say that the Commission, which had not previously been confronted with the problem of management trading during reorganization, was forbidden from utilizing [an administrative proceeding] for announcing and applying a new standard of conduct.\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, internal enforcement at the SEC preceded the SEC Division of Enforcement itself, as administra\u00adtive adjudication before the 1972 establishment of the Division simply took place in various decentralized SEC divisions.[footnote]Daniel M. Hawke, SEC Historical Soc\u2019y, Roundtable on Enforcement: A Brief History of the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Program 1934\u20131981, at 2 (2002), http:\/\/3197d6d14b5f19f2f440-5e13d29c4c016cf96cbbfd197c579b45.r81.cf1.rackcdn.com\/collection\/papers\/2000\/2002_0925_enforcementHistory.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/J7VA-WTXX] (\u201cIn August 1972, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission established its Division of Enforcement. Prior to this time, responsibility for enforcing the federal securities laws had been decentralized among the Commission\u2019s various operating divisions and regional offices.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhen the SEC chooses to bring an enforcement action internally\u2014at least since the inception of the SEC Division of Enforcement\u2014the SEC Division of Enforcement acts as a party to the dispute and aims to prove the SEC\u2019s case in front of an ALJ.[footnote]Beal, supra note 15, at 416.[\/footnote] Thereafter, \u201c[t]he ALJ\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. pre\u00adsides over the matter, including the evidentiary hearing, and issues an initial decision.\u201d[footnote]Thomas Glassman, Ice Skating Up <em>Hill<\/em>: Constitutional Challenges to SEC Administrative Proceedings, 16 J. Bus. &amp; Sec. L. 47, 52 (2016).[\/footnote] If a defendant loses before an ALJ, the defendant then may petition for the SEC to review the case de novo.[footnote]Id. at 53. Some have argued that this arrangement is circular. See, e.g., Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1162 (\u201cCritics also complain that the first-level appeal from the ALJ\u2019s decision is not to a federal court, but to the very same Commission that authorized the proceeding in the initial instance.\u201d); Eaglesham, In-House Judges, supra note 2 (arguing defendants appealing to the SEC will receive a decision from the \u201csame body that decided the case against [the defendants] should go forward in the first place\u201d). That being said, the Supreme Court has long condoned the practice of agency enforcement proceeding in-house. Stephen J. Choi &amp; A.C. Pritchard, The SEC\u2019s Shift to Administrative Proceedings: An Empirical Assessment, 34 Yale J. on Reg. 1, 3 (2017).[\/footnote] A party that loses in front of the SEC itself can petition for review by a federal court of appeals, either in the aggrieved party\u2019s home circuit or the D.C.

Dodd-Frank was not the first expansion of SEC enforcement power, but its alteration of these key structural limitations vis-\u00e0-vis jurisdictional discretion and punitive capabilities differentiates Dodd-Frank from prior adjustments to the SEC\u2019s enforcement capabilities and seems to be the catalyst behind the recent outpouring of public criticism. Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1148 (describing, colorfully, Dodd-Frank\u2019s effect by noting that \u201c[i]t was as though a dam holding back pent up rage about the fairness of the Commission\u2019s administrative proceedings had suddenly burst\u201d). Consider the Penny Stock Reform Act (PSRA) of 1990, a major expansion of SEC enforcement power that many characterize as the modern source of ALJ prominence. 3D Harold S. Bloomenthal &amp; Samuel Wolff, Securities and Federal Corporate Law \u00a7\u00a020:15 (2d ed. 2017) (\u201cThe Commission\u2019s extensive areas of adjudication and remedies in such adjudication were significantly broadened by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Bob Van Voris &amp; Matt Robinson, For the SEC\u2019s In-House Court, a Question of Justice for All, Bloomberg (Aug. 10, 2015), http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-10\/for-the-sec-s-in-house-court-a-question-of-justice-for-all (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). The PSRA allowed the SEC to bring suits for <em>punitive <\/em>rather than simply remedial disgorgement penalties, including the ability to bar or revoke securities licenses in some instances. David Zaring, Enforcement Discretion at the SEC, 94 Tex. L. Rev. 1155, 1164\u201365 (2016) [hereinafter Zaring, Enforcement Discretion]. And yet, while the PSRA increased the strength of the SEC\u2019s hand both with respect to settlement and adjudications themselves, it also \u201cleft the federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction over cases where the securities laws were violated but the defendants were not licensed to practice before the Commission.\u201d Id. at 1165.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt the risk of blurring history through generalization, several com\u00admentators seem to agree that in the early days of the SEC, and certainly in the days before Dodd-Frank, the SEC was both relatively constrained by Congress with respect to its choice of forum and, as a policy choice, less inclined to make frequent use of administrative proceedings. Both of these factors contributed to a regulatory ecosystem in which defendants viewed SEC administrative proceedings as largely noncontroversial.[footnote]See, e.g., Beal, supra note 15, at 416 (\u201cHistorically, congressional limitations on which proceedings could be brought in front of ALJs along with the SEC\u2019s infrequent use of ALJs resulted in little discontent among defendants participating in administrative law proceedings.\u201d); Ryan Jones, The Fight over Home Court: An Analysis of the SEC\u2019s Increased Use of Administrative Proceedings, 68 SMU L. Rev. 507, 520\u201321 (2015) (arguing that the SEC\u2019s increased use of ALJs has contributed to a disgruntled regulated population). Another possible contributing factor to this lack of controversy is the fact that formal administrative adjudication dates back to before even the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), thereby ingraining the legitimacy of the practice in the collective consciousness of the regulated community.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2. <em>SEC Administrative Proceedings After Dodd-Frank<\/em>. \u2014 Dodd-Frank was signed into law in July 2010 amid the tumultuous aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.[footnote]Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.

Section 929P(a) gives the S.E.C. the power through inter\u00adnal administrative proceedings to impose substantial mon\u00adetary penalties against any person or entity whatsoever if that person or entity has violated the federal securities laws, even if the violation was unintentional.[footnote]Rakoff, supra note 1, at 5. As a fascinating aside, Rakoff points out that \u201cthe sole legislative history of Section 929P(a) in the House Report on Dodd-Frank states that \u2018This section streamlines the SEC\u2019s existing enforcement authorities by permitting the SEC to seek civil money penalties in cease-and-desist proceedings under Federal securities laws.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6 (quoting H.R.

The simplest explanation of the backlash seems to be the concerted policy effort by the SEC to bring a <em>significantly<\/em> larger percentage of cases in-house[footnote]See supra note 27 and accompanying text (providing data on the SEC\u2019s increased use of in-house proceedings); see also supra note 34 and accompanying text (noting the SEC\u2019s announced policy decision to channel more cases in-house).[\/footnote] coupled with the industry\u2019s suspicion, whether or not empirically supported, that cases brought before ALJs are more likely to return a favorable outcome for the SEC. One frequently cited piece observed that the SEC achieved favorable results in ninety percent of internal SEC proceedings between October 2010 and March 2015, compared to in sixty-nine percent of fed\u00aderal court cases during the same timeframe.[footnote]See Eaglesham, In-House Judges, supra note 2 (observing that \u201c[t]he commissioners decided in their own agency\u2019s favor concerning 53 out of 56 defendants in appeals\u201d from January 2010 to March 2015); see also Rachel E.

Coffee, Jr., Paradigms Lost: The Blurring of the Criminal and Civil Law Models\u2014and What Can Be Done About It, 101 Yale L.J. 1875, 1887 (1992) (\u201cIndeed, the one common denominator in the SEC experience with administrative law judges is familiar: the SEC always seems to win before its in-house judges.\u201d); Zaring, Enforcement Discretion, supra note 27, at 1168 (\u201cAppeals from an ALJ\u2019s \u2018initial decision\u2019 are made to the SEC itself, which can amend or reverse the decision, although it usually does not.\u201d). But see Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1182\u201384 (questioning the reliability of some empirical arguments accusing the SEC of wielding a statistically significant in-house advantage and of arguments attempting to counter these accusations); Velikonja, Are the SEC\u2019s ALJs Biased?, supra note 4, at 366 (\u201c[T]he data in this debate is no trump card.\u201d).\r\nWhat both sides of the empirical debate may fail to fully appreciate is the extent to which the <em>perception<\/em> of unfairness undercuts the legitimacy of the SEC in much the same way as actual unfairness. Even if empirical gamesmanship accusations reflect nothing more than industry paranoia, the appearance of impropriety that emerges from guiding more actions in front of SEC ALJs (coupled with the reluctance of the federal courts to entertain constitutional challenges to this arrangement) seems likely to draw into question the SEC\u2019s credibility. Cf. Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1153 (\u201cTypically, when a plaintiff selects a forum, the factfinder is not in the plaintiff\u2019s employ, the appeal is not to the plaintiff itself, and the plaintiff does not control the rules governing the proceeding.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe upshot has been clear: In the aftermath of Dodd-Frank, the SEC, invigorated with a significant expansion of enforcement capabilities and unaltered discretion as to when the Commission can bring enforcement actions in (purportedly SEC-favorable) administrative proceedings, began to bring more cases internally as opposed to in federal court.[footnote]Stillings, supra note 16, at 99 (\u201cA year before Dodd-Frank was enacted, the SEC filed 53% of its cases in the [administrative law courts], and by the end of 2014, 81% of the SEC\u2019s cases were filed in-house.\u201d); Jean Eaglesham, SEC Is Steering More Trials to Judges It Appoints, Wall St. J.

More pointedly: If parties feel that they do not have an opportunity for meaningful review\u2014in federal court\u2014of claims criticizing the very structure of the SEC ALJ enforcement apparatus, the industry frustration may very well continue to generate unnecessary litigation costs and perhaps even political backlash against the SEC, impeding the SEC\u2019s ability to pursue its goal to \u201cprotect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.\u201d SEC, What We Do, http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/about\/whatwedo.shtml [http:\/\/perma.cc\/2ZLS-RHMV] (last updated June 10, 2013).[\/footnote] The regu\u00adlated community has made essentially the following argument: First, the SEC is directing cases in-house more frequently[footnote]Eaglesham, In-House Judges, supra note 2 (\u201c[H]undreds of decisions show[] how much of a home-court advantage the SEC enjoys when it sends cases to its own judges rather than federal courts. This is a practice the agency increasingly follows.\u201d). Along similar lines, Kara Brockmeyer, then-head of the SEC\u2019s anti-foreign-corruption enforcement unit, publicly stated that \u201c\u2018[i]t\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s the new normal\u2019\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018Just like the rest of the enforcement division, we\u2019re moving towards using administrative proceedings more frequently.\u2019\u201d Eaglesham, Steering, supra note 46.[\/footnote] and appears to win the vast majority of these in-house prosecutions.[footnote]See, e.g., Glassman, supra note 19, at 56 (\u201cIn\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 2012, the SEC won seven of seven contested administrative proceedings [and]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. 67% of its federal trials.

Most impor\u00adtantly, it is misleading to say that ALJs are \u201chired\u201d by the SEC. While the SEC does appoint ALJs, ALJs must first be hired by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), then added to a list (based on a variety of OPM-determined factors) from which the SEC can then select and appoint ALJs.[footnote]Vanessa K.

Exclusive Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Administrative Proceedings<\/h3>\r\nHaving discussed some of the most salient changes to SEC adminis\u00adtrative enforcement vis-\u00e0-vis Dodd-Frank, and by implication the motiva\u00adtion for industry actors to challenge the SEC\u2019s emboldened behav\u00adior, this section turns to the doctrinal framework governing these challenges. Section I.B.1 introduces the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> framework implicated by questions of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in admin\u00adistrative pro\u00adceedings. Section I.B.2 then reviews the jurisprudential backdrop to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> alongside a brief discussion of administrative preclusion and exhaustion.\r\n\r\n1. <em>The Doctrinal Framework: <\/em>Thunder Basin<em> Factors.<\/em> \u2014 When the SEC, or any government agency for that matter,[footnote]For an example of this type of constitutional challenge in the context of the CFPB, see John Doe Co. v. CFPB, 849 F.3d 1129, 1134\u201335 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (approvingly citing <em>Tilton<\/em> and referencing the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors to analyze the constitutional challenge to the CFPB).[\/footnote] elects to bring an action via administrative proceeding as opposed to in federal district court, the party subject to the enforcement action may challenge any or all aspects of the nature of the administrative proceeding itself.[footnote]See, e.g., Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236, 1239 (11th Cir. 2016) (challenging the SEC ALJ proceeding on Article II Appointments Clause grounds, among other constitutional claims); Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 768 (7th Cir. 2015) (challenging the SEC ALJ proceeding on equal protection grounds, among other constitutional claims). For a well-done summary of recent constitutional challenges to SEC administrative proceedings, see Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 11\u201322.[\/footnote] In the typical case in the context of SEC administrative proceedings, the target of the SEC\u2019s in-house enforcement action seeks to enjoin the SEC in an Article III court from further pursuing the internal enforcement;[footnote]See Gupta v. SEC, 796 F. Supp. 2d 503, 506 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (\u201cIn response to this seeming exercise in [SEC] forum-shopping, [Defendant] promptly filed in this Court a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. against the SEC.\u201d).[\/footnote] the SEC then responds by asserting that the statutory framework authorizing the inter\u00adnal enforcement scheme precludes review by an Article III court pending conclusion of the administrative proceeding.[footnote]See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 489 (2010) (noting the government argument that the administrative scheme provided an \u201cexclusive route to review\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt this point, the reviewing Article III court faces the dilemma of deter\u00admining whether or not it has jurisdiction over the request for injunc\u00adtive relief on constitutional grounds.[footnote]See, e.g., Duka v. SEC, 103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 390 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (\u201cThe Court notes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that the issue being reviewed here is whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim for injunctive and declaratory relief.\u201d), abrogated by Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] If the statute at issue does not expressly preclude federal court jurisdiction,[footnote]Section 701(a)(1) of the APA provides that judicial review may be expressly pre\u00adcluded by the relevant organic act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0701 (2012).[\/footnote] the court must resolve the jurisdictional question with a view to implicit delegation or withhold\u00ading of jurisdiction.[footnote]See <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 281 (\u201cThe statutes that establish the SEC\u2019s scheme of administrative and judicial review, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Advisers Act, do not expressly preclude federal district court jurisdiction over the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim. The crucial jurisdictional issue\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is whether the statutes do so implicitly.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this question, courts look to <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich<\/em>, which lays out a general framework within which courts are instructed to consider whether Congress intended to limit the jurisdic\u00adtion of federal courts pending the conclusion of an agency proceeding.[footnote]510 U.S. 200 (1994).[\/footnote] In <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>itself, the petitioning mine operator refused to comply with a regulation of the Department of Labor\u2019s Mine Safety and Health Administration requiring mine operators to publicly post cer\u00adtain union representative information, promulgated pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977.[footnote]Id. at 202\u201304.[\/footnote] Instead, petitioner \u201cfiled suit in the United States District Court\u201d and the \u201cDistrict Court enjoined respondents from enforcing [the regulation]\u201d on grounds that requiring the petitioner to challenge the interpretation of the Act in the statutory review process would constitute a Fifth Amendment Due Process violation.[footnote]Id. at 205\u201306.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision, concluding that the Act \u201cpreclude[d] district court jurisdiction over the pre-enforcement challenge made\u201d and that judicial review \u201cin the appropriate court of appeals\u201d is precluded until comple\u00adtion of the administrative review.[footnote]Id. at 206\u201308.[\/footnote] The Court identified three factors to help lower courts determine whether Congress intends, absent an explicit directive, to limit Article III court jurisdiction over such challenges:\r\n<blockquote>[W]e presume that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdic\u00adtion [1] if \u201ca finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review\u201d; [2] if the suit is \u201cwholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and [3] if the claims are \u201cout\u00adside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d[footnote]Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 489 (2010) (quoting <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, 510 U.S. at 212\u201313).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe so-called \u201c<em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors\u201d have remained operative, with little substantive change, in the years since <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> was decided.[footnote]It is worth emphasizing, particularly given the focus of this Note, that not a single Supreme Court case since <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> has explicitly questioned the framework itself; instead, courts adhere closely to the factors identified and vigorously debate application to the facts at hand. See, e.g., Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 15\u201316 (2012) (quoting the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors); <em>Free Enter.<\/em>, 561 U.S. at 489 (citing <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> as the appropriate framework).[\/footnote] The continued utility of the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>test seems to reflect, in part, a dual intuition that the administrative state is the proper forum for cer\u00adtain claims but not others (for example, constitutional claims) and the desire to give aggrieved parties the opportunity for meaningful judicial review before Article III judges.[footnote]Cf. <em>Elgin<\/em>, 567 U.S. at 16 (\u201c[A]djudication of the constitutionality of congressional enactments has generally been thought beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, 510 U.S. at 215)); New Orleans Pub.

Gas Co., 212 U.S. 19, 40 (1909))).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2. <em>The Evolution of<\/em> Thunder Basin<em>.<\/em> \u2014 <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> does not exist in isolation. The question of whether claims against an agency may be pre\u00adcluded or delayed from judicial review implicates the fairly robust bodies of administrative law on implied preclusion (which asks <em>if<\/em> judicial review will be available) and exhaustion (which asks <em>when<\/em> judicial review will be available). An in-depth discussion of either topic here is unnecessary, but even the cursory review provided below underscores three important points about these bodies of law relevant to this Note. First, courts as a gen\u00aderal matter seem to disfavor preclusion, particularly of constitutional ques\u00adtions.[footnote]See infra note 97 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Second, in cases where administrative action entails a <em>coercive<\/em> effect, courts appear skeptical of either preclusion or forcing the aggrieved party to exhaust its administrative remedies.[footnote]See infra notes 98\u201399 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Finally, notwith\u00adstanding the first and second points, courts recognize that imposing <em>no<\/em> preclusion or exhaustion requirements may improperly disrupt an administrative scheme.[footnote]See infra notes 100\u2013104 and accompanying text; see also Chau v. SEC, 72 F. Supp. 3d 417, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\u201cThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction is not an escape hatch for litigants to delay or derail an administrative action when statutory channels of review are entirely adequate.\u201d), aff\u2019d, 665 F. App\u2019x 67 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPreclusion is grounded in the language of the APA. Under \u00a7\u00a0701(a)(1) of the APA, judicial review is available \u201cexcept to the extent that\u2014(1) statutes preclude judicial review.\u201d[footnote]5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0701 (2012).[\/footnote] While there is an interest\u00ading line of cases demonstrating the ability of courts to creatively provide for review even in cases of <em>express<\/em> preclusion,[footnote]See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 368 n.9 (1974) (finding \u201cfinal and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review\u201d as not preclusive); Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 51 (1955) (finding \u201cfinal\u201d in the organic act not preclusive).[\/footnote] more pertinent here is the question of <em>implied<\/em> preclusion, as the SEC has not, to date, argued that judicial review of parallel constitutional challenges was <em>expressly<\/em> pre\u00adcluded by Congress.[footnote]See, e.g., Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir. 2016) (framing the discussion in terms of implied preclusion); Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 768 (7th Cir. 2015) (same).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUnder the doctrine of implied preclusion, the Supreme Court has held that the presumption of judicial review is a \u201cheavy burden\u201d[footnote]Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 672 (1986).[\/footnote] to overcome but also that this presumption may be countered when congres\u00adsional intent to preclude is \u201cfairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\u201d[footnote]Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 351 (1984) (\u201c[T]he presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d).[\/footnote] The Court has held that the presumption of review is strongest in cases raising questions of constitutional or statutory interpretation.[footnote]See, e.g., <em>Bowen<\/em>, 476 U.S. at 678 (\u201c[I]t is implausible to think [Congress] intended that there be <em>no<\/em> forum to adjudicate statutory and constitutional challenges\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Oestereich v. Selective Serv. Sys. Local Bd. No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 242 (1968) (\u201cAdjudication of the constitutionality of congressional enactments has generally been thought beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn <em>Sackett v. EPA<\/em>, a relatively recent treatment of implied preclu\u00adsion, the Supreme Court refused to find a challenge to the issuance of an EPA compliance order (these orders entail potential fines of up to $75,000 per day for noncompliance) precluded from judicial review. [footnote]566 U.S. 120, 131 (2012).[\/footnote] The Court specifically rejected the Government\u2019s \u201cefficiency\u201d argument, that is, that compliance orders \u201ccan obtain quick remediation through volun\u00adtary compliance\u201d with the Clean Water Act:\r\n<blockquote>The APA\u2019s presumption of judicial review is a repudiation of the principle that efficiency of regulation conquers all. And there is no reason to think the [Act] was uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of regulated parties\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. without the oppor\u00adtunity for judicial review.[footnote]Id. at 130\u201331. For more background on the APA\u2019s presumption of reviewability, see generally Donald M. Levy, Jr. &amp; Debra Jean Duncan, Judicial Review of Administrative Rulemaking and Enforcement Discretion: The Effect of a Presumption of Unreviewability, 55 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 596, 604 (1987) (\u201cThe legislative history of the APA, by stressing the availability of judicial review for \u2018abuse of discretion,\u2019 and by adopting a strong presumption in favor of judicial review, implies that the APA\u2019s preclusion of judicial review of administrative discretion should be read narrowly.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nOn the other hand, <em>Block v. Community Nutrition Institute <\/em>(<em>C<\/em><em>NI<\/em>) illus\u00adtrates the Court\u2019s countervailing concern with <em>excessive<\/em> access to judicial review.[footnote]467 U.S. at 347\u201348 (describing how expanding judicial review would give regulated entities ways to circumvent the administrative procedures prescribed by Congress).[\/footnote] In <em>CNI<\/em>, the Court refused to allow individual milk <em>consumers<\/em> to challenge milk market orders issued under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.[footnote]Id. at 341.[\/footnote] The Court reasoned that access to review was intended only for milk <em>producers and handlers<\/em>, and to hold otherwise would disrupt the operation of the scheme enacted by Congress.[footnote]Id. at 348 (\u201cAllowing consumers to sue the Secretary would severely disrupt this complex and delicate administrative scheme.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>CNI <\/em>also provides an instructive segue to the closely related doctrine of exhaustion, which in some cases requires parties to present their argu\u00adments to the relevant agency before bringing these arguments into an Article III court. Although later cases have seemingly stymied the long\u00adstanding practice of judicial superimposition of exhaustion require\u00adments on top of the APA,[footnote]See, e.g., Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993).[\/footnote] <em>CNI<\/em> recognized the potential disruption that might result from parties using the presumption of reviewability to avoid exhaustion of administrative remedies: \u201cIt would provide handlers with a convenient device for evading the statutory requirement that they first exhaust their administrative remedies.\u201d[footnote]<em>CNI<\/em>, 467 U.S. at 348.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt the crux of this tension\u2014between impeding the ability of agen\u00adcies to function and depriving regulated entities from meaningful review\u2014lies <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>. <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> cobbled together several of the cases cited above, in addition to various others,[footnote]For example, the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> Court referenced <em>Mathews v. Eldridge<\/em> as an instance in which the Court found that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0405(g), the organic act at issue, required administrative exhaustion of Social Security disability benefits claims, but <em>not<\/em> of the constitutional due process questions raised simultaneously. Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 213 (1994) (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 330 (1976)).[\/footnote] in order to provide an analytical tool for courts\u2014absent explicit Congressional guidance\u2014to differentiate the <em>types<\/em> of challenges to agencies that are best funneled through agency administrative schemes from those challenges best brought directly to Article III courts.[footnote]Id. at 212.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, it should be noted that referring to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> as a \u201ctool\u201d rather than a \u201cresolution\u201d is intentional. The <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> decision itself reflected the difficulty that courts face in determin\u00ading when judicial review will be \u201cmeaningful,\u201d suggesting in one instance that eventual judicial review can be meaningful,[footnote]Id. at 215 (finding that eventual review by the relevant court of appeals would provide meaningful judicial review).[\/footnote] while suggesting in another that eventual judicial review may lack meaning when parties cannot obtain \u201cfull postdeprivation relief.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 213.[\/footnote] The <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors provide a clear example of law implicating policy. As such, in keeping with the line of cases leading to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, courts are likely to achieve the best results by tying decisions to the practicalities of the par\u00adticular scheme at issue.\r\n<h2>II. Backlash: Constitutional Challenges and <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em><\/h2>\r\nThe recent line of cases leading to and including <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em> illus\u00adtrates the three general problems that have been exacerbated by Article III courts refusing to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitu\u00adtional challenges to SEC administrative proceedings pending completion of the administrative action. First, reading <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> to imply that \u201cmeaningful\u201d review is satisfied by any <em>eventual<\/em> review[footnote]Chau v. SEC, 72 F. Supp. 3d 417, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (holding that defendants seeking to enjoin administrative proceedings \u201cmust patiently await the denouement of proceedings within the Article II branch\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting USAA Fed. Sav. Bank v. McLaughlin, 849 F.2d 1505, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1988))), aff\u2019d, 665 F. App\u2019x 67 (2d Cir. 2016). While \u201ceventual\u201d review is often enough to moot claims of improper preclusion, courts appear generally less likely to preclude jurisdiction or require exhaustion when constitutional issues are raised or when the administrative action entails a coercive effect, as discussed above. See supra notes 95\u201397 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] effectively reduces <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> to a binary analysis (\u201cwill review be available at some point?\u201d) without consideration of the coercive or con\u00adstitutionally dubious elements of an administrative proceeding. Second, given the incentive for parties to settle prior to reaching a trial, administrative or otherwise, this cabining of constitutional challenges constrains the ability of Article III courts to develop administrative and constitutional law. Third, the insulation of SEC administrative proceed\u00adings from constitutional challenge runs counter to fairness intuitions, feeding suspicions of games\u00admanship[footnote]Gamesmanship concerns have only been made more acute by the SEC\u2019s failure to articulate a clear standard for forum selection when bringing enforcement actions.

Constitutional Challenges<\/h3>\r\nThe manifestation of the industry-consternation zeitgeist vis-\u00e0-vis Dodd-Frank-induced SEC internal enforcement has been an array of attacks on the constitutionality of SEC administrative proceedings.[footnote]See, e.g., Peter J.

SEC<\/em> provided the first example of a federal appeals court engaging this question of subject mat\u00adter jurisdiction.[footnote]799 F.3d 765.[\/footnote] In <em>Bebo<\/em>, after the SEC alleged that Laurie Bebo had committed various securities violations, Bebo brought suit in the district court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, alleging that the SEC\u2019s enforcement scheme violated the Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]Id. at 767.[\/footnote] The Seventh Circuit, affirming the district court, found that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a078(y), the statute governing the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme, indicated that \u201cCongress intended plaintiffs in Bebo\u2019s position \u2018to proceed exclusively through the statutory review scheme\u2019\u201d and refused to exercise subject matter jurisdiction.[footnote]Id. (quoting Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Bebo<\/em>\u2019s disposition was less significant than the Seventh Circuit\u2019s two notable observations on the<em> Thunder Basin<\/em> factors.[footnote]Note that the <em>Bebo<\/em> court refers at times to the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors as the \u201c<em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em>\u201d factors, referencing <em>Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board<\/em>, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), which, with a few glosses beyond the scope of this Note, restates the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors. See <em>Bebo<\/em>, 799 F.3d at 772. As such, to avoid confusion, this Note refers to the three-pronged test only as the \u201c<em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors.\u201d[\/footnote] First, the court con\u00adcluded that the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d prong is the most important of the three-pronged test, relegating the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside agency expertise\u201d prongs to an ambiguous role in the framework, to the extent they retain any force at all.[footnote]<em>Bebo<\/em>, 799 F.3d at 774 (\u201cWe think the most critical thread in the case law is the first <em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em> factor: whether the plaintiff will be able to receive meaningful judicial review without access to the district courts.\u201d).[\/footnote] Second, the court made clear that \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d could be satisfied by <em>any<\/em> eventual judicial review in an Article III court.[footnote]Id. (noting Bebo could \u201craise her objections in a circuit court of appeals established under Article III\u201d only \u201cafter the pending enforcement action has run its course\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s reading of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for parties to have constitutional claims heard in Article III courts prior to the conclusion of administrative pro\u00adceedings, even when these claims are outside the agency\u2019s expertise and wholly collateral to the statute\u2019s review provisions, so long as the statutory provision allows for <em>any<\/em> hearing in front of an Article III court. Indeed, this is exactly what happened in <em>Bebo<\/em>: The <em>Bebo <\/em>court conceded that \u201cBebo\u2019s suit can reasonably be characterized as \u2018wholly collateral\u2019 to the statute\u2019s review provisions and outside the scope of the agency\u2019s exper\u00adtise,\u201d and yet it still refused to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the claims because Bebo could eventually raise her complaints in the D.C. Circuit on appeal.[footnote]Id. at 767.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn rendering this final decision, the Seventh Circuit appeared pre\u00adoccupied with the possibility that allowing the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction could open the floodgates to defendants using constitutional challenges to evade SEC administrative proceedings.[footnote]Id. at 775 (\u201cEvery person hoping to enjoin an ongoing administrative proceeding could make this argument.\u201d). When this question ultimately reached the Fourth Circuit, the court raised a similar concern. See Bennett v. SEC, 844 F.3d 174, 188 (4th Cir. 2016) (\u201cAdopting Bennett\u2019s argument would provide no limiting principle: Anyone could bypass the judicial-review scheme established by Congress simply by alleging a constitutional challenge and framing it as \u2018structural,\u2019 \u2018prophylactic,\u2019 or \u2018preventative.\u2019\u201d).[\/footnote] Rather than risk introducing a potential avenue of evasion, the court raised a formidable jurisdictional barrier.[footnote]Cf. Jones, supra note 28, at 522 (noting that, if one assumes <em>any<\/em> judicial review will be meaningful, \u201cmeaningful judicial review will virtually always exist, and the claim would fail the first prong of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> test\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Bebo<\/em> requires parties to undergo the expense and negative publicity associated with an SEC prosecution and to endure several layers of adminis\u00adtrative review prior to the hearing of constitutional arguments before an Article III court, at which point the damage of the allegedly unconstitu\u00adtional proceeding will have already been done.[footnote]<em>Bebo<\/em>, 799 F.3d at 775 (explicitly rejecting Bebo\u2019s argument that \u201cby the time she is able to seek judicial review in a court of appeals, she will have already been subjected to an unconstitutional proceeding\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, in all likelihood the case will at that point have been settled.[footnote]See supra note 52.[\/footnote] Some obser\u00advers, surprised with this implication, predicted <em>Bebo<\/em> would become an outlier for its jurisdictional holding.[footnote]See, e.g., Joseph Quincy Patterson, Note, Many Key Issues Still Left Unaddressed in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Attempt to Modernize Its Rules of Practice, 91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1675, 1691 (2016) (\u201cCurrently, <em>Bebo<\/em> seems to be the exception, and more courts are deciding that defendants have subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis intuition was proven incorrect in <em>Jarkesy v. SEC<\/em>.[footnote]803 F.3d 9 (D.C. Cir. 2015).[\/footnote] Because <em>Jarkesy<\/em> gave voice to several policy concerns with allowing parallel subject matter jurisdiction for constitutional challenges to SEC in-house proce\u00addures, it merits close attention.\r\n\r\nIn <em>Jarkesy<\/em>, the SEC brought an administrative enforcement action against George Jarkesy, Jr. on the basis of alleged securities fraud.[footnote]Id. at 12.[\/footnote] After Jarkesy countered with a parallel suit in D.C. district court raising several constitutional challenges to the proceeding, the district court found Congress had \u201cimplicitly precluded concurrent district-court jurisdic\u00adtion.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] On appeal, the D.C. Circuit applied the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors and upheld the preclusion. Judge Srikanth Srinivasan, writing for the court, provided the following <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>gloss:\r\n<blockquote>We do not understand those considerations to form three dis\u00adtinct inputs into a strict mathematical formula. Rather, the con\u00adsiderations are general guideposts useful for channeling the inquiry into whether the particular claims at issue fall outside an overarching congressional design.[footnote]Id. at 17.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nJudge Srinivasan did not cite to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> to support this interpretive proposition. This is not to suggest Judge Srinivasan was necessarily incorrect in re\u00adfusing to \u201cmathematically\u201d apply the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors but rather to underscore the fact that the <em>Jarkesy<\/em> opinion appears to implicitly blur the factors and consequently privilege the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d fac\u00adtor over the remaining two. Perhaps more tellingly, Judge Srinivasan specifically noted, with approval, that the <em>Bebo<\/em> court appeared to merge several of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> steps in the fashion discussed above.[footnote]Id. at 22 (\u201c[T]he Seventh Circuit declined to find\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. jurisdiction on [the basis of meaningful judicial review] alone, which the court viewed to be the \u2018most critical\u2019 factor.\u201d); see also Chau v. SEC, 665 F. App\u2019x 67, 70 (2d Cir. 2016) (echoing the sentiment that \u201c[the court has] recognized that the first factor\u2014meaningful judicial review\u2014is most important\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Jarkesy<\/em> is noteworthy for two additional background elements that suggest an awareness of the general industry tumult reviewed above and a tendency toward defensive opining: First, the D.C. Circuit seemed con\u00adcerned that defendants like Jarkesy could use facial attacks on the constitutionality of a statute to deflect any SEC administrative enforce\u00adment to the federal forum.[footnote]<em>Jarkesy<\/em>, 803 F.3d at 25 (\u201c[A]n exception to an otherwise exclusive scheme for constitutional challenges in general\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would encourage respondents\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to frame their challenges to the [SEC\u2019s] actions in those terms.\u201d).[\/footnote] Second, the court indicated that the logistical kerfuffle and cost that would be permitted by exercising juris\u00addiction could throw into disarray the entire framework established by Congress.[footnote]Id. at 29 (\u201cThe rationale underlying Congress\u2019s decision to create statutory schemes like the one before us is that \u2018coherence and economy are best served if all suits pertaining to designated agency decisions are segregated in particular courts.\u2019\u201d (quoting City of Rochester v. Bond, 603 F.2d 927, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1982))).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Bebo <\/em>and <em>Jarkesy<\/em> demonstrate two crucial points: First, the courts evinced, not necessarily unreasonably, concern that exercising subject matter jurisdiction over these constitutional challenges could open the floodgates to use of these challenges as a dilatory vehicle[footnote]Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 773 (7th Cir. 2015) (concluding, among other things, that the court ought to consider \u201cwhether the constitutional claims are being raised as a \u2018vehicle\u2019 to challenge agency action taken during an administrative proceeding\u201d).[\/footnote] or, worse, a large-scale attack on the administrative state. Second, both courts read the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> three-factor test as prioritizing consideration of \u201cmeaningful judicial review,\u201d but with that factor interpreted purely as \u201ceventual\u201d judicial review. It is this second doctrinal mutation that comes to the fore in <em>Tilton<\/em>, and with which Judge Christopher Droney in dissent took issue.\r\n<h3>B. Tilton and Its Implications<\/h3>\r\nThis section provides a close reading of <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em>; such a reading suggests that the <em>Tilton<\/em> court ignored the fact that, even if the \u201cmeaning\u00adful judicial review\u201d prong of <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> overpowers in some sense the other two, review cannot be meaningful if defendants must suffer the very harm, that is, the reputational and expense costs of litigation (not to mention alleged constitutional impropriety), that they seek to enjoin.[footnote]For analogous reasoning, see Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. SEC, 609 F.2d 570, 577 (2d Cir. 1979) (\u201c[T]o require appellants to exhaust their administrative remedies would be to require them to submit to the very procedures which they are attacking.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n1. Tilton<em> Background.<\/em> \u2014 In March 2015, the SEC initiated an in-house proceeding against Lynn Tilton, known affectionately as the \u201cDiva of Distressed\u201d for her work with troubled companies,[footnote]Nate Raymond, SEC, \u2018Diva of Distressed\u2019 Tilton Face Off in Fraud Trial, Reuters (Oct. 24, 2016), http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-sec-tilton-idUSKCN12O2MM [http:\/\/perma.cc\/5G2L-647H].[\/footnote] for alleged violations of the Investment Advisers Act.[footnote]Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 280 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] The SEC alleged Tilton defrauded investors by mischaracterizing assets of her fund Patriarch Partners.[footnote]Raymond, supra note 141.[\/footnote] Tilton then filed suit in the Southern District of New York seeking an injunction, raising the affirmative defense that the in-house proceeding was unconstitutional because the presiding ALJ\u2019s appoint\u00adment violated Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause.[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 280. On the one hand, the nature of the challenge seems to entail an implausible outcome, insofar as it could destabilize much of the administrative state or at the very least require rethinking of the appointment and behavior of the ALJs active not only at the SEC but also at other administrative agencies. Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 17 (\u201cALJs are utilized across the federal bureaucracy. A judicial ruling finding them unconstitutional\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would be potentially transformative.\u201d (footnote omitted)); Philip J. Griffin, Comment, Developments in SEC Administrative Proceedings: An Evaluation of Recent Appointment Clause Challenges, the Rapidly Evolving Judicial Landscape, and the SEC\u2019s Response to Critics, 19 U. Pa. J. Bus. L. 209, 228 (2016) (\u201cA Supreme Court determination that the SEC\u2019s ALJ appointment process is unconstitutional would affect not only the SEC, but also all 31 other federal administrative agencies, which together appoint more than 1,300 ALJs.\u201d). Indeed, depending on one\u2019s views as to the degree of implausibility, one might take the more extreme position that these challenges are so \u201cobjectively unreasonable in constitutional law\u201d as to be a form of \u201cconstitutional bad faith.\u201d David E. Pozen, Constitutional Bad Faith, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 885, 933 (2016). On the other hand, this was not enough to stop a recent Tenth Circuit panel in Bandimere v. SEC, 844 F.3d 1168, 1188 (10th Cir. 2016), from accepting an Appointments Clause challenge identical to that put forth by <em>Tilton<\/em>, splitting with the opposite holding of the D.C. Circuit in Raymond J. Lucia Cos. v. SEC, 832 F.3d 277 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Indeed, after the D.C. Circuit declined to rehear <em>Lucia<\/em> en banc, Lucia v. SEC, 868 F.3d 1021, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 2017), the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari on January 12, 2018. Lucia v. SEC, No. 17-130, 2018 WL 386565 (Jan. 12, 2018). For background on the <em>Bandimere<\/em> challenge and its significance, see generally Casey M. Olesen, Case Note,\u00a0Creating Mischief: The Tenth Circuit Declares the SEC\u2019s Administrative Law Judges Unconstitutional in <em>Bandimere v. Securities Exchange Commission<\/em>, 70 Me. L.

SEC, 796 F. Supp. 2d 503, 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (same).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOn appeal to the Second Circuit, Tilton argued that the failure of the SEC to appoint ALJs in accordance with the Appointments Clause rendered the administrative proceeding unconstitutional, warranting a permanent injunction of the administrative proceeding.[footnote]Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 10\u201311, 30\u201343, <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d 276 (No. 15-2103), 2015 WL 4400932.[\/footnote] As such, the ongoing proceeding would \u201citself constitute a grave constitutional injury that could not be redressed after the fact.\u201d[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 283.[\/footnote] To support this position, Tilton raised, among others, the following related arguments: First, <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> has been understood to evaluate \u201cnot whether denying district court jurisdiction could preclude <em>all<\/em> judicial review, but rather, whether such a denial would preclude all \u2018meaningful\u2019 judicial review.\u201d[footnote]Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants, supra note 147, at 17 (citing <em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em> as an example of this approach to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>).[\/footnote] Second, forcing exhaustion upon Tilton would lead to meaningless review in that it would fail to offer the relief sought, that is, an injunction to block an allegedly unconstitutional proceeding, and force injury upon Tilton in the form of \u201cthe attendant \u2018embarrassment, expense,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. ordeal[,]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

Writing for the majority, Judge Robert Sack reviewed the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors in the mode endorsed by <em>Bebo<\/em> and <em>Jarkesy<\/em>: Judge Sack acknowledged that the questions of whether the suit was \u201cwholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d and whether the claims were \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d presented close calls,[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 282.[\/footnote] but stressed that the Appointments Clause claim <em>would<\/em> be subject to meaningful judicial review through administrative channels and that this \u201cweigh[ed] strongly against district court jurisdiction.\u201d[footnote]Id. Judge Sack tellingly cited <em>Bebo<\/em> to support the proposition that meaningful judicial review is the \u201cmost important\u201d <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factor. Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn refusing to exercise jurisdiction, Judge Sack specifically rejected the argument that review cannot be meaningful as a product of \u201cinher\u00adent remedial limitations of post-proceeding review,\u201d and made clear, as did the <em>Bebo<\/em> and <em>Jarkesy <\/em>courts, that \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d may be satisfied by \u201cany\u201d judicial review.[footnote]Id. at 284 (noting the key to \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d is the \u201caccessibility of post-proceeding review by a federal court of appeals,\u201d not the adequacy of post-proceeding remedies). One peculiar feature here is Judge Sack\u2019s recognition that <em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em>, heavily relied upon by Tilton to argue post-proceeding review would be meaningless, entailed a scheme that did not in fact entirely preclude review, although the remaining path to review was excessively \u201ccircuitous.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] Acknowledging that post-proceeding relief may fail to restore \u201cfinancial and emotional resources,\u201d Judge Sack nonetheless maintained that this \u201cimperfect\u201d relief \u201csuffices to vindicate the litigant\u2019s constitutional claim.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 285.[\/footnote] To support this proposition, Judge Sack pointed to <em>FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of California<\/em>,[footnote]449 U.S. 232 (1980).[\/footnote] in which an oil company argued that the requirement to exhaust all administrative options before bringing suit in federal court should be waived because the com\u00adpany would suffer injury from \u201cexpense and disruption\u201d if com\u00adpelled to complete the administrative proceeding.[footnote]Id. at 232\u201333.[\/footnote] In <em>Standard Oil<\/em>, the Supreme Court recognized that the company would suffer \u201csubstantial\u201d expense and disruption at the hands of the administrative proceeding, but that this hardship was \u201cpart of the social burden of living under government,\u201d rather than an irreparable injury requiring immediate judicial review.[footnote]Id. at 244 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Petroleum Expl., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 304 U.S. 209, 222 (1938)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nJudge Sack then proceeded to provide relatively brief treatments of the second and third <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors. Regarding the question of whether Tilton\u2019s claim was wholly collateral to the administrative pro\u00adceeding, Judge Sack argued that the Appointments Clause claim <em>could<\/em> be \u201cnarrowly categorized as collateral to the statutory merits\u201d but was not \u201c<em>wholly<\/em> collateral to the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme more broadly,\u201d given that the claim was \u201cprocedurally intertwined\u201d with the proceed\u00ading.[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 287\u201388. As Judge Droney pointed out in dissent, this seems to effectively eliminate the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d question in any case in which an administrative proceeding has begun. Id. at 296 (Droney, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] Regarding expertise, Judge Sack briefly noted that perhaps the SEC could bring to bear its expertise in resolving factual issues related to the constitutional claims, even if this relationship between factual and constitutional issues was proven solely by the SEC\u2019s ability to \u201cobviate\u201d the need to hear Tilton\u2019s constitutional arguments with an order in favor of Tilton.[footnote]Id. at 289\u201390.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAll told, the Second Circuit added momentum to the interpretations given in <em>Bebo<\/em> and <em>Jarkesy<\/em>, finding both that \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d is the key prong of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> review and that this prong can be sat\u00adisfied by eventual review in an Article III court, even if the harm sought to be avoided has, by that time, already occurred.[footnote]See id. at 291.[\/footnote] Shortly after <em>Tilton<\/em>, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Northern District of Georgia\u2019s willing\u00adness to exercise subject matter jurisdiction, noting in part that the court \u201cagree[d] with the Second and Seventh Circuits that the first factor\u2014meaningful judicial review\u2014is \u2018the most critical thread in the case law.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 774 (7th Cir. 2015)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>Judge Droney\u2019s Dissent.<\/em> \u2014 Judge Droney\u2019s <em>Tilton<\/em> dissent provides the only example at the circuit level of serious concern regarding the prioriti\u00adzation of \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d over the remaining <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors. Judge Droney, seeing nothing in the case law to justify this emergent hierarchy within the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>framework, argued that the majority\u2019s holding eviscerated the remaining two factors.[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 292 (Droney, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe majority\u2019s application of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors has stripped the \u2018wholly collateral\u2019 and \u2018outside the agency\u2019s expertise\u2019 factors of any significance: in its view, as long as administrative proceedings have been initiated, those two factors are always satisfied.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nJudge Droney reasoned that the majority\u2019s singular focus on whether the statutory scheme provides for Article III review (as a proxy for mean\u00adingful judicial review) changed the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> analysis from one aimed at <em>substantively<\/em> evaluating the constitutional claims at issue into one <em>procedurally<\/em> concerned with whether petitioners had the ability to eventually reach an Article III forum.[footnote]Id. at 293\u201395 (arguing the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> Court \u201cconsider[ed] the substance of the claims\u201d and \u201cmade no reference to the procedural aspects of the claim\u201d). For a similar intuition that <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> aims to encourage substantive case-specific analysis, see Chau v. SEC, 72 F. Supp. 3d 417, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\u201c<em>Thunder Basin<\/em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. teach[es] that the question of whether a special statutory scheme provides for adequate review of administrative actions involves case-specific determinations. Whether jurisdiction exists in a particular instance depends in significant part on the nature of the constitutional claim at issue.\u201d), aff\u2019d, 665 F. App\u2019x 67 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] To this end, the majority, per Judge Droney\u2019s interpretation, had misread <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> to suggest that \u201ca claim is not wholly collateral if it has been <em>raised in response to<\/em>, and so is procedurally intertwined with, an administrative proceeding,\u201d[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 295 (Droney, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting the <em>Tilton<\/em> majority) (emphasis added).[\/footnote] and that a claim was not outside agency expertise if the agency\u2019s decision \u201cmight fully dispose of the case.\u201d[footnote]Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 23 (2012)).[\/footnote] The end result, Judge Droney argued, was a reduction of the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201cagency expertise\u201d prongs to a binary analysis of whether or not administrative proceedings are ongoing.[footnote]Id. at 295\u201396 (suggesting this binary approach is inconsistent with <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> and its progeny). Judge Droney later points out that, under a substantive analysis of agency expertise, it is clear that \u201cthe SEC has no particular expertise in determining whether the system of appointing its [ALJs] comports with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.\u201d Id. at 297.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAfter critiquing the doctrinal shift away from <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>\u2019s \u201cholistic analysis\u201d of congressional intent, Judge Droney turned to the proverbial elephant in the Note: meaningful judicial review. Judge Droney began his discussion of meaningful judicial review by conceding that, per the majority\u2019s analysis, \u201cthis factor tends to weigh in favor of preclusion because a subsequent appeal to this Court following a final Commission order is available.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] And yet, perhaps spurred by \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201cagency expertise\u201d losing doctrinal significance in any substantive sense, Judge Droney raised the \u201csubstantial question as to whether subsequent judicial review here would be \u2018meaningful.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nJudge Droney reasoned that review cannot be meaningful if the pro\u00adceeding defendants seek to challenge has already occurred by the time defendants reach a federal court:\r\n<blockquote>Forcing the appellants to await a final Commission order before they may assert their constitutional claim in a federal court means that by the time the day for judicial review comes, they will already have suffered the injury that they are attempt\u00ading to prevent.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. In my view, this diminishes the weight of [the meaningful judicial review factor], for while there may be review, it cannot be considered truly \u201cmeaningful\u201d at that point.[footnote]Id. at 298. Another, albeit more extreme, form of Judge Droney\u2019s argument might take the position that eventual review is truly meaningless insofar as a court reviewing the constitutionality of an internal SEC proceeding after the proceeding has concluded would be forced to dismiss this challenge for mootness. See Weiss, supra note 119, at 1430 (\u201c[O]n direct review, a court would likely hold [the] challenge was moot, and thus presented a nonjusticiable question to the court. As such, the appeal would be denied without considering the merits of the challenge.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\n<a name=\"_Toc466202323\"><\/a>Judge Droney\u2019s dissent engaged the exact tension raised in the dis\u00adcussion of implied preclusion and exhaustion above.[footnote]See supra section I.B.2 (discussing the doctrinal frameworks governing implied preclusion and exhaustion).[\/footnote] In determining whether exhaustion or preclusion is appropriate, courts attempt to balance the \u201cinstitutional interest\u201d of the agency in forcing parties to proceed through administrative channels against the \u201cindividual interest\u201d in prompt Article III court review.[footnote]See, e.g., McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 146 (1992) (\u201cIn determining whether exhaustion is required, federal courts must balance the interest of the individual in retaining prompt access to a federal judicial forum against countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion.\u201d).[\/footnote] In some contexts, eventual review appears to be sufficient.[footnote]See, e.g., Mikuriya v. Leavitt, 248 F. App\u2019x 818, 820 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding the statutory scheme at issue required exhaustion unless \u201cadministrative procedures would mean denying all judicial review\u201d).[\/footnote] In other contexts, perhaps most saliently constitutional challenges or instances in which an administrative action is deemed coercive, courts appear highly uncomfortable with equating meaningful and eventual review.[footnote]See, e.g., Gray Fin. Grp., Inc. v. SEC, 166 F. Supp. 3d 1335, 1345 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (\u201c[T]he Court finds that the SEC\u2019s definition [that is, \u2018eventual judicial review\u2019] provides no <em>meaning<\/em> to the term \u2018<em>meaningful<\/em>.\u2019\u201d), vacated and remanded sub nom. Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] Judge Droney is no doubt aware that preclusion is a permissible and longstanding feature of admin\u00adistrative law, but he seemed to dissent out of concern that an absolute reduction of preclusion analysis to a binary question of whether \u201ceventual\u201d review is available may not be a desirable outcome.\r\n\r\n4. Tilton <em>Epilogue.<\/em> \u2014 Suffice it to say, in light of all the foregoing, the present cocktail of industry outrage, expansion of SEC authority, and failure to grant the regulated community the opportunity for meaning\u00adful\u2014rather than \u201ceventual\u201d\u2014hearing of their constitutional complaints, is undesirable and unstable. Spirited challenges to the SEC\u2019s enforce\u00adment framework seem unlikely to subside,[footnote]See Sarah A. Good, Not the Last Challenge to SEC\u2019s Use of ALJs, Pillsbury (May 12, 2016), http:\/\/www.pillsburylaw.com\/en\/news-and-insights\/not-the-last-challenge-to-sec-s-use-of-aljs.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/S5A2-DN2C] (noting several emerging circuit splits borne out of challenges to the SEC\u2019s ALJs); supra note 144 (noting the recent creation of a circuit split on the Appointments Clause challenge to SEC ALJs).[\/footnote] the legitimacy-threatening accusations of gamesmanship seem unlikely to dissipate, and Article III courts will be impeded from developing administrative doc\u00adtrine and acting as a meaningful constitutional check on the behavior of adminis\u00adtrative agencies.[footnote]Cf. William F. Funk, To Preserve Meaningful Judicial Review, 49 Admin. L. Rev. 171, 178 (1997) (\u201cAbsent the threat of meaningful judicial review, agencies may well give short shrift to legal requirements and limitations.\u201d); Thornley &amp; Blount, supra note 25, at 281 (\u201cAll of these procedural shortcomings might be forgiven, or at least overlooked, if there were an opportunity for a meaningful appeal from the hearing. However, any appeal from an SEC ALJ\u2019s initial ruling proceeds to the SEC.\u201d). The aftermath of <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em> is instructive in this regard. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari to Tilton\u2019s appeal from the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, Tilton ultimately won her case on the merits of the alleged securities violations, securing a dismissal from SEC ALJ Carol Fox Foelak. Lynn Tilton, SEC Release No. 1182, 117 SEC Docket 14, 2017 WL 4297256, at *49 (ALJ Sept. 27, 2017) (initial decision). One could argue that Tilton\u2019s victory before an SEC ALJ cuts against arguments of bias or gamesmanship. However, this argument fails to consider two critical points: First, Tilton\u2019s victory in defending against the securities charges ensured that her constitutional challenges never received a hearing in an Article III court, as her claims would have been moot. Second, as Tilton herself later acknowledged, her ability to spend \u201cmany tens of millions of dollars\u201d is not common to all SEC defendants, which suggests that Tilton\u2019s ability to see her defense through to a judgment on the merits may not be an option for other defendants pressured into a settlement before having the opportunity for review by the SEC Commissioners, let alone an Article III forum. See Alison Frankel, Lynn Tilton: It Took \u2018Many Tens of Millions of Dollars\u2019 to Beat Skewed SEC System, Reuters (Sept. 28, 2017), http:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/legal-us-otc-tilton\/lynn-tilton-it-took-many-tens-of-millions-of-dollars-to-beat-skewed-sec-system-idINKCN1C32ZT (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (\u201c\u2018I feel truly grateful to Judge Foelak,\u2019 Tilton said. \u2018But it doesn\u2019t change my opinion that cases like these belong in federal court. I absolutely feel my rights were compromised.\u2019\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n<h2>III. Return to Meaningful Judicial Review<\/h2>\r\nIt should be clarified emphatically at the outset, before turning to the proposals below, that this Note is concerned with what Article III courts, the SEC, and Congress <em>should<\/em> do, rather than what each body <em>could <\/em>do within the bounds of the law. Notwithstanding the doctrinal critique\u2014a critique this author happens to believe is meritorious\u2014regarding the recent lack of faithfulness to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, concern with industry outrage, interest in preserving SEC legitimacy, and worry that SEC in-house prosecution may stunt Article III court development of administrative and constitutional law are all concerns of <em>policy<\/em> and insti\u00adtutional design.[footnote]Potentially, although surely not without considerable popular resistance, Congress could, pursuant to Article III, strip jurisdiction <em>entirely <\/em>from Article III courts for matters relating to securities enforcement. Daniel A. Farber, Legislative Constitutionalism in a System of Judicial Supremacy, <em>in <\/em>The Least Examined Branch: The Role of Legislatures in the Constitutional State 431, 442 (Richard W. Bauman &amp; Tsvi Kahana eds., 2006). And almost certainly, Congress has the power to amend Dodd-Frank to explicitly preclude Article III subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to ALJ proceedings pending the conclusion of the proceeding. See Griffin, supra note 144, at 221 (noting the conditions under which Congress can limit the original jurisdiction of federal district courts over constitutional claims). Arguably this type of radically revised congressional approach to the role of the Article III courts would be a more transparent method for raising the questions regarding allocation of authority between Article III courts and administrative agencies raised by this Note.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Note simply seeks to draw attention to a doctrinal development that has effectively stripped the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> evaluation of any serious attention toward substantive, <em>meaningful<\/em> review of constitutional chal\u00adlenges, which may have repercussions both insofar as it insulates the SEC from Article III court review given the incentives to settle[footnote]See supra note 52.[\/footnote] and in the sense that outright hostility from the regulated community is not a desirable policy outcome. Moreover, this niche jurisdictional question has proven a vehicle for shadowboxing over the proper role of the admin\u00adistrative state in pursuing complex statutory objectives, and as such, it offers an opportunity for more forthright dialogue between the SEC and the regulated community.\r\n\r\nThis Part proposes two solutions: (1) The SEC or Congress should promulgate detailed, and binding, forum selection guidelines, thereby reducing the impression that SEC forum decisions are arbitrary or evidence of gamesmanship; (2) future courts hearing challenges simi\u00adlar to <em>Tilton<\/em> should apply standard injunction analysis akin to <em>Duka v. SEC<\/em>.[footnote]103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 389 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), abrogated by Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276 (2d Cir. 2016); see also infra section III.B (discussing <em>Duka<\/em> in detail).[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>A. Forum Selection Guidelines<\/h3>\r\nThe SEC or Congress should clearly indicate the types of enforce\u00adment actions that will be brought internally within the SEC as opposed to those pursued in federal district court. Through this adoption of binding forum selection guidelines, private parties will be able to spend more time ensuring compliance with securities laws and preparing for the possibility of prosecution in a particular forum and less time contesting the nature of the forum. In May 2015, the SEC released a very brief commen\u00adtary on its process for forum selection.[footnote]SEC, Division of Enforcement Approach to Forum Selection in Contested Actions (2015), http:\/\/files.drinkerbiddle.com\/Templates\/media\/files\/pdfs\/SEC-Guidance(1).pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/E8DJ-D6AY]; see also Grundfest Testimony, supra note 52, at 3 (\u201c[T]he Commission has issued a statement describing four factors it considers when deciding whether to initiate proceedings in an administrative forum or in federal court. These factors have been criticized as exceptionally malleable and as not placing any meaningful limit on the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d).[\/footnote] However, this state\u00adment, identifying a \u201cnon-exhaustive list of factors\u201d to help determine the proper forum, was both nonbinding and too general to have meaningful impact on industry frustration.[footnote]Nicholas Bourtin et al., Sullivan &amp; Cromwell Discusses SEC Guidance on Approach to Forum Selection in Contested Actions, CLS Blue Sky Blog (June 15, 2015), http:\/\/clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu\/2015\/06\/15\/sullivan-cromwell-discusses-sec-guidance-on-approach-to-forum-selection-in-contested-actions\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/72RF-8X46] (noting that, notwithstanding the issuance of forum selection guidelines, the SEC maintains \u201cthe circumstances of each particular case will ultimately govern where the case is brought\u201d); see also Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 2\u20133 (\u201cThese changes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would surely be a step in the right direction if adopted. But they are too little, too late. Challengers will not be deterred and critics will not be won over unless the SEC undertakes a broader, deeper review and recalibration.\u201d).[\/footnote] That is to say, when the forum guide\u00adlines are drafted such that the SEC has enough wiggle room to effectively retain complete discretion, the guidelines will do little to assuage the regulated community\u2019s suspicions that the SEC is leveraging the forum purely to secure an advantage.\r\n\r\nProviding more specific forum selection guidelines, and binding the SEC to these guidelines, should appeal both to the regulated community insofar as it avoids being blindsided by SEC forum choice and also to the SEC, given the SEC\u2019s explicit recognition of the souring public impression of internal enforcement.[footnote]See Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 46 (noting that former SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar \u201csuggested the agency adopt guidelines governing the choice of forum, in order to \u2018avoid the perception that the Commission is taking its tougher cases to its in-house judges, and to ensure that all are treated fairly and equally\u201d (quoting Michael S. Piwowar, Comm\u2019r, SEC, A Fair, Orderly, and Efficient SEC, Remarks at 2015 SEC Speaks Conference (Feb. 20, 2015), http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/022015-spchcmsp.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/2C87-23P2])).[\/footnote] While \u201cindustry outrage\u201d is not necessarily itself cause for concern,[footnote]See supra note 49 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] the fact that this outrage translates to chal\u00adlenges threatening major changes to the SEC\u2019s enforcement appa\u00adratus should give the SEC reason for pause.[footnote]Consider <em>Bandimere v. SEC<\/em>, discussed above, in which the Tenth Circuit upheld an Appointments Clause challenge\u2014finding ALJs unconstitutionally appointed\u2014with far-reaching implications for the functionality of the SEC and administrative state more broadly. 844 F.3d 1168, 1188 (10th Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] If the SEC or Congress were to adopt forum selection guidelines, this would allow the SEC or Congress to take command of the SEC\u2019s future rather than wait for a potentially adverse outcome in challenges to the very nature of the SEC.\r\n\r\nSection III.A.1 argues that detailed and binding forum selection guidelines will help to bolster the SEC\u2019s legitimacy insofar as they coun\u00adter the impression that forum selection has become an exercise in pro\u00adsecutorial advantage. Section III.A.2 then presents the related argument that forum selection guidelines, regardless of the allocation codified, will serve as a starting point for a much-needed discussion over the proper scope and role of SEC internal enforcement among legisla\u00adtors, the SEC, and the regulated community.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Maintain SEC Legitimacy.<\/em> \u2014 Forum selection guidelines may go a long way toward bolstering the perceived legitimacy of the SEC as an enforcement body to the extent that these guidelines could combat the critique that the SEC is leveraging the bias of in-house judges to prosecute difficult cases.[footnote]See, e.g., Morgenson, Home-Court Edge, supra note 34 (\u201c[S]ome legal experts say these proceedings suffer from potential bias because the judges operate within the agency bringing them. The possibility of a home-court advantage or a sympathetic adjudicator, critics say, raises questions of fairness\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] That being said, several have argued that, much like the SEC\u2019s in-house judges, Article III judges have problematic biases of their own. In <em>The Real World of Arbitrariness Review<\/em>, Professors Thomas Miles and Cass Sunstein, after empirical review, conclude that judges\u2019 \u201c[p]olitical commitments\u201d significantly impacted their ability to unbiasedly review agency adjudicative decisions in cases involving the EPA and NLRB.[footnote]Thomas J. Miles &amp; Cass R. Sunstein, The Real World of Arbitrariness Review, 75 U. Chi. L. Rev. 761, 767 (2008).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Note can muster two brief responses to this objection: First, the biases of Article III judges, unlike the supposed one-directional biases of SEC ALJs, are cross-cutting\u2014that is, Democrat-appointed and Republican-appointed judges are more likely to be sympathetic to liberal and con\u00adservative agency decisions, respectively.[footnote]Id. (\u201cWhen the agency decision is liberal, the Democratic validation rate is 72 percent and the Republican validation rate is 58 percent. When the agency decision is conservative, the Democratic validation rate drops to 55 percent and the Republican validation rate rises to 72 percent.\u201d). The SEC has taken the claims of ALJ bias seriously enough to conduct an internal investigation on the matter. See supra note 68. It may very well be the case, however, that the <em>appearance<\/em> of bias is just as significant as the question of whether bias <em>actually<\/em> exists. See infra note 188 (discussing the psychological impacts of appearances of bias).[\/footnote] Second, and more importantly, regardless of the extent to which actual bias exists in either the SEC or Article III courts, it is difficult to contest the fact that a body (in this case, the SEC) with the ability to investigate, prosecute, and judge parties in-house gives rise to a somewhat troubling fairness aesthetic. If this is indeed the case, the absence of forum selection guidelines may lead skeptics to question the propriety of the SEC\u2019s forum choices, even when these choices are justified. In the words of one commentator: \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t create actual bias, it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d[footnote]Morgenson, Home-Court Edge, supra note 34 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Ronald J. Riccio, Dean Emeritus, Seton Hall Law Sch.); see also Louis L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 320 (1965) (\u201cThe availability of judicial review is the necessary condition, psychologically if not logically, of a system of administrative power which purports to be legitimate, or legally valid.\u201d); Barnett, Administrative Judges, supra note 70, at 1671 (\u201cBy prohibiting the appearance of partiality, one primarily seeks to protect the integrity of the adjudicating body and validate the process.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [A] valid process helps to validate final agency action with litigants, reviewing courts, Congress, and the public.\u201d (footnote omitted)); Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1153 (\u201cThe appearance of impropriety under these circumstances is clear, even if one believes that the administrative process is itself largely fair and efficient.\u201d).[\/footnote] In an oft-cited passage, Professor Gary Lawson outlines one stylized progression of agency enforce\u00adment that reflects the intuitive distaste for intra-agency combina\u00adtion of functions:\r\n<blockquote>Consider the typical enforcement activities of a typical federal agency\u2014for example, of the Federal Trade Commission. The Commission promulgates substantive rules of conduct. The Commission then considers whether to authorize investigations into whether the Commission\u2019s rules have been violated. If the Commission authorizes an investigation, the investigation is conducted by the Commission, which reports its findings to the Commission. If the Commission thinks that the Commission\u2019s findings warrant an enforcement action, the Commission issues a complaint. The Commission\u2019s complaint that a Commission rule has been violated is then prosecuted by the Commission and adjudicated by the Commission. This Commission adjudica\u00adtion can either take place before the full Commission or before a semi-autonomous Commission administrative law judge. If the Commission chooses to adjudicate before an administrative law judge rather than before the Commission and the decision is adverse to the Commission, the Commission can appeal to the Commission. If the Commission ultimately finds a violation, then, and <em>only<\/em> then, the affected private party can appeal to an Article III court. But the agency decision, even before the bona fide Article III tribunal, possesses a very strong presumption of correctness on matters both of fact and law.[footnote]Gary Lawson, The Rise and Rise of the Administrative State, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1231, 1248\u201349 (1994) (footnotes omitted). The Supreme Court has proven highly unreceptive to Lawson\u2019s separation of powers critique, acknowledged by Lawson himself. Id. at 1249 (\u201cThe post-New Deal Supreme Court has never seriously questioned the constitutionality of this combination of functions in agencies.\u201d). Still, there is little doubt that the modern administrative state, and agency adjudication in particular, has exerted considerable pressure on at least some traditional constitutional understandings, such that it is not impossible to imagine the regulatory community reaching a breaking point of sorts and agitating for a reinvigoration of nondelegation principles. Cf. Caleb Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 594 (2007) (describing the ways in which modern administrative adjudication has exerted pressure on the traditional \u201cpublic rights\u201d and \u201cprivate rights\u201d dichotomy).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nOne could perhaps counter with the point that SEC ALJs are well aware that they will ultimately be subjected to Article III review, however circuitous the procedure to get there, and will therefore render unbiased decisions.[footnote]There are several who take this position. See, e.g., William F. Pedersen, Jr., Formal Records and Informal Rulemaking, 85 Yale L.J. 38, 59\u201360, 70 (1975) (suggesting that judicial review of agency decisionmaking can impose \u201cuseful discipline\u201d on the agency).[\/footnote] However, the fact that most SEC enforcement actions set\u00adtle[footnote]See supra note 52 and accompanying text (discussing pressures to settle).[\/footnote] calls into question the constraining effect of subsequent judicial review. Ultimately, given the troubling aesthetic of the SEC both prose\u00adcuting and judging the same action,[footnote]Grundfest Testimony, supra note 52, at 2 (\u201cWhile respondents have the right to appeal any Commission ruling to a federal court of appeals, the Kafka-esque quality of an appeal to the body that authorized the prosecution cannot be denied.\u201d).[\/footnote] forum selection guidelines could improve confidence in the regulated community.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Encourage Dialogue Regarding the Proper Role of SEC Internal Enforcement.<\/em> \u2014 Promulgation of detailed forum selection guidelines would provide the opportunity for all interested parties\u2014the SEC, Con\u00adgress, regulated actors, and so on\u2014to constructively debate a baseline forum allocation.[footnote]Henning, Rocket Docket, supra note 112 (\u201cRequiring the S.E.C. to provide\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. some guidance about what drives a case to a particular forum would help potential defendants understand what they are up against\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Guidelines would impose a measure of accountability on the S.E.C. to explain how it will treat violations in a fair and consistent manner.\u201d).\r\nWhile this Note does not take a position as to the proper allocation of actions vis-\u00e0-vis in-house and federal court proceedings, several commentators have offered tenable proposals. Professor Joseph Grundfest has argued for an arrangement in which the federal courts act as \u201ctraffic cop[s],\u201d determining whether various actions are properly suited to an administrative or federal forum, dividing administrative actions into three categories: \u201cThe first category would include all cases statutorily required to be litigated in the admin\u00adistrative forum as well as all cases for which administrative proceedings are appropriate because of the nature of the question presented and the SEC\u2019s specialized expertise,\u201d \u201ca second category would be composed of cases that must be heard in federal court and that may not be brought in administrative proceedings except with defendants\u2019 consent\u201d (for example, those actions calling for remedies not available in administrative proceedings), and \u201c[t]he third category would be composed of cases that fall in neither of these two categories. In these residual cases, if the Commission decides to bring an administrative action, then the respondent would be permitted to petition a federal district court for removal at the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1154\u201355.[\/footnote] In light of the uncontested differences in procedural mechanisms available in federal court versus an ALJ proceeding[footnote]U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Examining U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement: Recommendations on Current Processes and Practices 3 (2015), http:\/\/www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/021882_SEC_\r\nReform_FIN1.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6K86-Y259] (\u201cWhile the types of actions and the remedies [available] are similar, the two forums have substantial differences in process. These differences can have a significant impact on the procedural rights of a defendant\/respondent and, ultimately, on the respondent\u2019s ability to obtain a full, fair, and impartial adjudication.\u201d).[\/footnote] (and bracketing, for a moment, claims that SEC ALJs are far more likely than Article III judges to return a guilty verdict), it is crucial for both the SEC and regulated parties to consider how to best differentiate the types of cases properly heard in front of an Article III judge versus an ALJ.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, the \u201cdebate\u201d regarding the propriety of expanded SEC jurisdiction and discretion has already begun, but without the essen\u00adtial component of guidelines to evaluate. For example, several have argued that allowing the SEC to continuously widen its enforcement scope will undercut the SEC\u2019s mission by limiting federal courts from develop\u00ading the law and effectively insulating SEC decisionmaking from meaningful checks.[footnote]Rakoff, supra note 1, at 12 (\u201cI would urge the S.E.C. to consider that it is neither in its own long-term interest, nor in the interest of the securities markets, nor in the interest of the public as a whole, for the S.E.C. to become, in effect, a law [unto] itself.\u201d). Note also that several have argued that forum selection ambiguity has also led to \u201cunder-criminalization.\u201d See, e.g., Eithan Y. Kidron, Systemic Forum Selection Ambiguity in Financial Regulation Enforcement, 53 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 693, 694 (2016). But see Gillian E. Metzger, Administrative Constitutionalism, 91 Tex. L. Rev. 1897, 1900\u201302 (2013) (defending \u201cadministrative constitu\u00adtionalism,\u201d that is, the \u201celaboration of new constitutional understandings by administrative actors\u201d).[\/footnote] Others, perhaps most prominently Professor David Zaring, argue that the complete discretion of the SEC to prosecute where it chooses is an essential component of its ability to enforce effectively.[footnote]Zaring, Enforcement Discretion, supra note 27, at 1159. For a direct response to Zaring\u2019s argument, see generally Gideon Mark, Response, SEC Enforcement Discretion, 94 Tex. L. Rev. See Also 261 (2016), http:\/\/texaslawreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/\r\nMark-94-SeeAlso.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/AU92-2TD4].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn either case, having clear forum selection guidelines offers an opportunity for parties to propose, without excessive speculation absent guidelines, ways to limit what many deem \u201cunacceptable systematic ambiguity.\u201d[footnote]Kidron, supra note 195, at 696. Moreover, it is important to note, however briefly, that Congress could inject a great deal of clarity via some type of federal overlay constraining the SEC or at the very least channeling the SEC\u2019s use of ALJs in a fashion that is more predictable to the industry. As the dissent in <em>Tilton <\/em>pointed out, the entire purpose of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> framework is to determine Congress\u2019s intent. Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 296 (2d Cir. 2016) (Droney, J., dissenting). As such, Congress would be within its Article I powers to clearly provide an answer on jurisdictional preclusion in this context.[\/footnote] Moreover, to the extent outlining forum selection guidelines mitigates the outrage of the regulated community, this solution might help anticipate and prevent the industry agitating for a destabilizing overreaction to the SEC\u2019s aggressive enforcement tactics.[footnote]Consider a recent proposal by Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, which would \u201ceffectively gut the use of [SEC] in-house courts for cases.\u201d Peter J.

Hanusik et al., What\u2019s Missing from the SEC\u2019s Forum Selection Guidance, Law360 (May 21, 2015), http:\/\/www.law360.com\/articles\/658532\/what-s-missing-from-the-sec-s-forum-selection-guidance (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (critiquing the SEC\u2019s 2015 public statement on forum selection).[\/footnote] doctrinal pro\u00adposals are far less frequent. Recall that in <em>Tilton<\/em>, the Second Circuit was faced with a district court split on this question of subject matter juris\u00addiction.[footnote]See <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 280 (\u201cWhile the district court heard argument and deliberated, several other federal judges reached conflicting decisions on the same jurisdictional issue, creating a split both within and outside the Southern District.\u201d); supra section II.B.1.[\/footnote] The court chose to affirm Judge Abrams\u2019s analysis in the trial court, thereby refusing to exercise subject matter jurisdiction, and in doing so rejected Judge Berman\u2019s alternative approach in <em>Duka v. SEC<\/em>, which involved the use of standard injunction analysis to review the con\u00adstitutional challenges. This Note argues that future courts hearing chal\u00adlenges akin to <em>Tilton <\/em>should apply the framework employed most explicitly in <em>Duka<\/em>, which allows aggrieved parties the opportunity for meaningful judicial review of constitutional claims in an Article III court while enabling the Article III court to quickly return the case to the SEC ALJ if the constitutional challenge appears unlikely to succeed on the merits.\r\n\r\n<em>Duka<\/em> involved a paradigmatic case as far as this Note is concerned: The SEC initiated an internal enforcement action against Barbara Duka for alleged violations of section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Duka countered by filing an injunction in the Southern District of New York, claiming that ALJs are unconstitutionally insulated from presidential oversight in violation of Article II of the Constitution.[footnote]Duka v. SEC, 103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), abrogated by <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d 276.[\/footnote] Judge Berman held that (1) the court had subject matter jurisdiction over Duka\u2019s consti\u00adtutional claims, <em>but<\/em> (2) the preliminary injunction ought to be denied on grounds that the court deemed Duka unlikely to succeed on the merits.[footnote]Id. at 385\u201386.[\/footnote] <em>Duka<\/em> thus provided both <em>meaningful <\/em>judicial review while avoiding the trap of entertaining (what the court deemed) a meritless challenge.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Putting the \u201cMeaningful\u201d Back in Meaningful Judicial Review.<\/em> \u2014 <em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s willingness to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the consti\u00adtutional claim intimated the Court\u2019s sensitivity to the frustration of defendants who feel that the inability to bring challenges in district court has unfairly stacked the deck in the SEC\u2019s favor.[footnote]In a telling maneuver, Judge Berman framed the opinion with a quotation from New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350 (1989), on the right of parties to choose federal court when jurisdiction is proper: \u201cWhen a Federal court is properly appealed to in a case over which it has by law jurisdiction, it is its duty to take such jurisdiction.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The right of a party plaintiff to choose a Federal court where there is a choice cannot be properly denied.\u201d <em>Duka<\/em>, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 385 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc.<\/em>, 491 U.S. at 358\u201359).[\/footnote] The <em>Duka <\/em>court took the position that \u201ceventual\u201d judicial review of a constitutional challenge to an administrative proceeding cannot in any real sense be <em>meaningful <\/em>if the challenge is relegated to the aftermath of the administrative action, indicating that money spent on litigation and reputational costs were worthy of consideration.[footnote]<em>Duka<\/em>, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 390.[\/footnote] That is to say, regardless of outcome, <em>Duka<\/em> framed the decision to clearly signal that the court took the constitu\u00adtional challenge seriously, as opposed to simply a defense mechanism to the SEC enforcement.[footnote]<em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s posture in this regard, that is, conveying sensitivity to the plight of a party faced with potential harsh sanctions, is arguably not without precedent in the history of federal equity. Indeed, under the <em>Ex parte Young<\/em> lineage, even with <em>Armstrong<\/em>\u2019s more recent gloss, private parties have long had the right to seek injunctions of purportedly unconstitutional actions by federal officers. See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1383\u201384 (2015); Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155\u201356 (1908). This remedial right has recently been characterized by the Court as the \u201ccreation of courts of equity,\u201d capable of displacement by express congressional action, but otherwise malleable by federal courts in the pursuit of equitable outcomes. <em>Armstrong<\/em>, 135 S. Ct. at 1384. As such, it is not out of the question to suggest that federal courts could formally fashion an injunctive remedy similar to the <em>Duka<\/em> approach to handle constitutional challenges to the SEC.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne possible objection to <em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s threshold consideration of the merits of the constitutional challenge would be to argue that this approach wastefully imposes costs on the SEC Enforcement Division, which must convince an Article III court to dismiss a constitutional challenge before proceeding with the administrative action. This may very well be true, but this argument ignores the possibility that the ire of the regulated community may, via lobbying or otherwise, encourage an overly heavy-handed legislative response that causes far more disruption to the SEC enforcement regime than the <em>Duka<\/em> approach.\r\n\r\nThis possibility is far from insubstantial\u2014in April of 2017, Congressman Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) introduced H.R. 2128, the Due Process Restoration Act, which proposes to \u201cprovide respondents in SEC enforcement cases with the option to have their proceedings advance in a federal district court instead of internal SEC administrative courts.\u201d[footnote]Press Release, U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson, Rep. Davidson Introduces the Due Process Restoration Act of 2017 (Apr. 26, 2017), http:\/\/davidson.house.gov\/media-center\/press-releases\/rep-davidson-introduces-due-process-restoration-act-2017 [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/G84Y-YDXT] [hereinafter Davidson Press Release]. Other similarly drastic, at least relative to the status quo, legislative proposals have also been introduced. See H. Comm. on Fin. Servs., The Financial Choice Act: Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs 96\u2013101 (2016), http:\/\/financialservices.house.gov\/\r\nuploadedfiles\/financial_choice_act_comprehensive_outline.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/H6EA-LN5B] (proposing to (1) allow defendants in SEC enforcement actions to remove at-will to federal district court and (2) eliminate judicial deference to ALJ findings).[\/footnote] Congressman Davidson\u2019s proposal, currently pending before the House Financial Services Committee, declines <em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s relatively middle-ground approach and instead would allow <em>all<\/em> defendants to simply opt out of administra\u00adtive enforcement.[footnote]Davidson Press Release, supra note 206. For a strong criticism of this proposal, see, e.g., David Zaring, The Due Process Restoration Act of 2015 Would Kill Administrative Adjudication at the SEC, Conglomerate (Nov. 3, 2015), http:\/\/www.theconglomerate.org\/\r\n2015\/11\/the-dueprocess-restoration-act-of-2015-would-kill-administrative-adjudication-at-the-secnd-.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/NN7M-GA7A].[\/footnote] Article III courts, as well as all believers in the merits of administrative adjudication, therefore have good reason to adopt a compromise approach of the <em>Duka<\/em> ilk rather than await current industry antipathy to manifest itself in an incautious rollback of SEC enforcement capabilities.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Granting Injunctions (or Not) Using Standard Injunction Analysis.<\/em> \u2014 The key decisional element that this Note argues makes <em>Duka<\/em> the desira\u00adble framework is the <em>second<\/em> step of the analysis, that is, considering the success of the constitutional challenge on the merits. By employing standard injunction analysis[footnote]<em>Duka<\/em>, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 392.[\/footnote]\u2014asking whether \u201cPlaintiff (1) is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim, (2) will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, and (3) the public interest weighs in favor of granting the injunction\u201d\u2014<em>Duka\u2019<\/em>s approach catalyzes several positive effects: First, entertaining subject matter jurisdiction and <em>then<\/em> reviewing likelihood of success on the merits allows defendants to receive a hearing in federal court without having to navigate the serpentine internal pro\u00adcesses of the SEC, with the very likely possibility of the parties settling during the interim.[footnote]See supra note 52.[\/footnote] Second, as was the case in <em>Duka<\/em>, the second step of injunction analysis, which includes review of the likelihood of success on the merits, will weed out frivolous constitutional challenges, thereby encouraging defendants ex ante to carefully consider whether to raise a constitutional challenge at all.\r\n\r\nConcern that allowing district courts to exercise subject matter jurisdiction allows wealthy defendants to deflect meritorious SEC prose\u00adcutions is not unreasonable. However, this Note takes the position that this concern is misguided. As Judge Rakoff explained in another recent case:\r\n<blockquote>To be sure, it would not be prudent to allow every subject of an SEC enforcement action who alleges \u201cbad faith\u201d and \u201cselective prosecution\u201d to be able to create a diversion by bringing a parallel action in federal district court. But such diversionary tactics can be quickly disposed of in the ordinary case through dismissal for failure to plead a plausible claim.[footnote]Gupta v. SEC, 796 F. Supp. 2d 503, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Judge Rakoff went on to explain, \u201cA fear of abuse by litigants in other cases should never deter a federal court from its unfailing duty to provide a forum for vindication of constitutional protections to those who can make a substantial showing that they have indeed been denied their rights.\u201d Id.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nMoreover, it is certainly not inconceivable that the SEC, emboldened by the current hands-off approach of the circuits addressing the issue, could become even more aggressive about prosecuting in-house and in so doing, cross the line into the unconstitutional, thus calling for more aggressive prophylactic measures.[footnote]In the case of this eventuality, \u201cinjunctive relief has long been recognized as <em>the proper means for preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally<\/em>,\u201d and <em>Duka<\/em> would align with this intuition. Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001) (emphasis added).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>The Cost of<\/em> Duka<em>.<\/em> \u2014 Implementing injunction analysis in keeping with <em>Duka<\/em> would not be without cost. Dodd-Frank, the spark behind the recent backlash toward SEC behavior, was enacted with the purpose of tightening regulation on the financial industry in the aftermath of one the worst financial crises the United States has experienced since the Great Depression.[footnote]Remarks by the President at Signing of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, White House Office of the Press Sec\u2019y (July 21, 2010), http:\/\/obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\/the-press-office\/remarks-president-signing-dodd-frank-wall-street-reform-and-consumer-protection-act [http:\/\/perma.cc\/24JU-YMBU] (\u201cOver the past two years, we have faced the worst recession since the Great Depression. Eight million people lost their jobs. Tens of millions saw the value of their homes and retirement savings plummet.\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, one could argue with little difficulty that Dodd-Frank was passed with the express purpose of placing a thumb on the scale in favor of entities like the SEC.[footnote]Id. (\u201c[T]hese reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history.\u201d).[\/footnote] Were Article III courts to adopt the approach in <em>Duka<\/em> and exercise subject matter jurisdiction, even cursorily to determine feasibility of a claim before returning the matter to the SEC, this would no doubt interrupt the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions, imposing costs on the SEC resulting from having to halt the in-house action and litigate in an Article III court before potentially return\u00ading in-house.[footnote]But see <em>Gupta<\/em>, 796 F. Supp. 2d at 514 (\u201cA fear of abuse by litigants in other cases should never deter a federal court from its unfailing duty to provide a forum for vindication of constitutional protections.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nStill, the countervailing costs may be even more troubling. In dis\u00admissing Tilton\u2019s claims, the Second Circuit noted: \u201cThe litigant\u2019s financial and emotional costs in litigating the initial proceeding are <em>simply the price of participating in the American legal system<\/em>.\u201d[footnote]Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 285 (2d Cir. 2016) (emphasis added).[\/footnote] On this view, the require\u00adment to endure an SEC in-house administrative action prior to reaching an Article III court acts as a kind of tax on such challenges. This cost is compounded, as already argued, by the reputational damage, litigation expense, and risk (particularly for public companies) entailed by seeing an action through the many layers of SEC review before reach\u00ading a court of appeals. These costs, in turn, strongly incentivize settlement prior to Article III adjudication.[footnote]See supra note 52 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] If this is an accurate picture, challenges based in constitutional and administrative law may <em>never<\/em> reach an Article III hearing, threatening to stunt the growth of both areas of law with respect to the administrative state at a time when the administrative state is heavily relied upon.[footnote]For an illustration of the SEC\u2019s potential to prevent Article III courts from developing federal securities law, see John P. Flannery and James D. Hopkins, Securities Act Release No. 9689, Exchange Act Release No. 73840, Advisers Act Release No. 3981, Investment Company Act Release No. 31374, at 12 (Dec. 15, 2014), http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/litigation\/opinions\/2014\/33-9689.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/87YY-S6RQ] (providing the SEC\u2019s own interpretation of the statute at issue to resolve \u201cinconsistencies,\u201d as characterized by the SEC, in federal district court).[\/footnote] Just as it may be exces\u00adsively dire to suggest that the entire SEC apparatus is unconstitutional, it may be too dismissive to suggest that the SEC, given sufficient insulation from Article III court review, will not be tempted to push the envelope into the realm of unconstitutional behavior.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nThe post-Dodd-Frank SEC operates in a climate that simultaneously demands rigorous regulation of financial actors and is character\u00adized by widespread attacks, both meritorious and otherwise, on the adminis\u00adtrative state itself. As such, it has become increasingly important for the SEC to clearly articulate a reasoned and diligent enforcement strategy while maintaining its legitimacy as a fair and apolitical body. The increased enforcement capabilities of the SEC combined with the move to pro\u00adsecute more frequently in-house has generated a mutual antipathy that undermines the legitimacy of the SEC and has materialized in chal\u00adlenges to the SEC that could destabilize the Commission.\r\n\r\nThis climate has only been exacerbated by the refusal of Article III courts to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional chal\u00adlenges to the nature of SEC administrative proceedings and the failure of the SEC to articulate clear forum selection guidelines.\r\n\r\nAllowing Article III courts to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to the SEC\u2019s in-house proceedings\u2014whether achieved doctrinally via <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>or legislatively through forum selection guidelines\u2014has the potential to reduce the temperature of the controversy surrounding SEC in-house proceedings, bolster the SEC\u2019s legitimacy as an enforcement body, and ensure that Article III courts remain independently capable of developing administrative and constitutional law.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7\u00a01 (\u201cThe Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\u201d).[\/footnote] from exercising parallel jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to the administrative proceeding itself, <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich<\/em> instructs Article III courts to presume a claim is <em>not<\/em> confined to administrative channels if: (1) preclusion would prevent \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d; (2) the suit is \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to a statute\u2019s review apparatus; and (3) the claims brought are \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d[footnote]510 U.S. 200, 212\u201313 (1994).[\/footnote] On June 17, 2016, in <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em>, a split Second Circuit panel evaluated a claim challenging the constitutionality of SEC ALJs\u2014after the SEC had already begun a separate in-house enforcement action against petitioners\u2014and held that subject matter jurisdiction was indeed precluded.[footnote]824 F.3d 276, 279 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] In doing so, the Second Circuit aligned with the Seventh, D.C., and most recently Eleventh and Fourth Circuits in interpreting <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> and its progeny to suggest both that \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d is the most important of the three \u201c<em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors\u201d identified above; and \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d is satisfied if an administrative scheme provides for any <em>eventual<\/em> judicial review of petitioner\u2019s claim.[footnote]Bennett v.

See Tilton v. SEC, 137 S. Ct. 29, 29 (2016) (denying certiorari); see also <em>Tilton v.

See, e.g., Lisa Lambert &amp; Sarah N. Lynch, Trump May Already Have a Plan Ready to Revamp Dodd-Frank, Reuters (Nov. 11, 2016), http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-election-trump-doddfrank-idUSKBN1361X0 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/NLR6-QJME] (discussing Trump\u2019s public indications of intent to weaken Dodd-Frank). In the summer of 2017, the Trump Administration released a 150-page report that took steps to weaken several key elements of Dodd-Frank, calling for the severe limitation of the so-called \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d and the curtailment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s (CFPB) enforcement capabilities (including a requirement that the CFPB prosecute its actions in federal court rather than via administrative proceedings). See U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities: Banks and Credit Unions 71\u201392 (2017), http:\/\/www.treasury.gov\/press-center\/press-releases\/Documents\/A%20Financial%20System.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/587F-VCWA]. However, as of this writing, the Trump Administration has neither materially changed nor threatened to materially change the SEC\u2019s internal enforcement apparatus. See generally id. (providing recommendations for reforming the U.S. financial system according to Trump\u2019s announced \u201cCore Principles\u201d but not suggesting changes to the SEC\u2019s internal enforcement mechanisms). Were Dodd-Frank to be eliminated in any meaningful capacity vis-\u00e0-vis SEC administrative proceedings, this would of course change the climate surrounding many of the issues addressed herein. However, the questions would remain of how and whether Article III courts exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to administrative proceedings, inside and outside of the SEC, and whether this provides a desirable check on administrative agencies.[\/footnote] is (1) a doctrinally dubious application of the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors, as it excises the \u201cmeaningful\u201d from \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d; (2) concern\u00ading insofar as it constrains the ability of Article III courts to develop admin\u00adistrative and constitutional law; and (3) undesirable as a policy matter in that it significantly hinders the ability of parties to challenge purported SEC constitutional violations, undercutting the legitimacy of the SEC at a time when skepticism toward the Commission and its enforcement strat\u00adegy runs relatively high.[footnote]The current skepticism arguably applies to the administrative state writ large, but even among critics of the administrative state, the SEC seems of late to attract particularly acute criticism. See, e.g., Ilan Wurman,\u00a0Constitutional Administration, 69 Stan. L. Rev. 359, 372 (2017) (\u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is perhaps the worst offender, routinely bringing enforcement actions in front of its own judges, who rarely rule against the SEC.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Note proposes two responses, one legislative and the other doc\u00adtrinal. Legislatively, the SEC or (ideally) Congress should promulgate binding and detailed forum selection guidelines for enforcement actions. Doctrinally, Article III courts that have yet to rule on this ques\u00adtion should employ standard injunction analysis, exercising jurisdiction over the constitutional claims and gauging the likelihood of success on the merits of those claims.[footnote]For a discussion of two recent district court opinions employing standard injunction analysis, see infra section III.B. By \u201cstandard injunction analysis,\u201d this Note refers to the framework routinely employed by federal courts determining whether or not injunctive relief is appropriate as an equitable matter, that is, by asking \u201cwhether Plaintiff (1) is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim, (2) will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, and (3) the public interest weighs in favor of granting the injunction.\u201d Duka v. SEC, 103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), abrogated by <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d 276.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe first proposal will help mitigate the industry uproar by improv\u00ading the transparency of SEC reasoning regarding forum selection and will encourage much-needed discussion regarding the types of cases that should properly be brought in each forum, that is, the administrative law court or Article III body. The second proposal will ensure that those prosecuted by the SEC have a meaningful opportunity for judicial review of their constitutional and administrative law claims in the district court while also weeding out frivolous defensive tactics camouflaged as consti\u00adtutional challenges.[footnote]From the outset, it is important to note that the proposals made herein are not without cost. Opening the door to threshold constitutional challenges may force enough expense upon the SEC in the form of litigation and transactional costs that the SEC will refuse to bring cases internally altogether, thereby disrupting or even dismantling the administrative scheme itself. See infra section III.B.3.[\/footnote] Allowing district courts to exercise jurisdiction over parallel constitutional challenges to SEC administrative proceedings will act as a prophylactic mechanism, cautioning the SEC against engaging in unconstitutional behavior, reassuring the industry that legitimate consti\u00adtutional violations will be subject to meaningful review, and preventing important questions of administrative and constitutional law from being decided outside Article III courts.\r\n\r\nPart I of this Note provides background on the SEC\u2019s use of internal enforcement actions and describes the doctrinal framework governing subject matter jurisdiction in cases challenging the constitutionality of ongoing administrative proceedings. Part I directs special attention to the tension between allowing meaningful Article III court review of chal\u00adlenges to administrative proceedings and reluctance to allow such challenges to disrupt congressionally enacted administrative schemes.[footnote]See infra section I.B.2 (discussing how the doctrines of administrative preclusion and exhaustion help courts navigate this tension and how these doctrines relate to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>). This tension largely animates the line of cases discussed in Part II.[\/footnote] Part II catalogues the recent line of cases refusing to exercise subject matter jurisdiction and then discusses in detail the reasoning in and impli\u00adcations of the Second Circuit\u2019s split <em>Tilton <\/em>decision. Part III outlines potential solutions to the problems identified in Parts I and II.\r\n<h2>I. Overview of the Legislative and Doctrinal Framework<\/h2>\r\nThis Part provides an overview of the legislative and doctrinal back\u00adground governing judicial consideration of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in constitutional challenges to ongoing administrative pro\u00adceedings, with a focus on the SEC, SEC ALJs, and SEC in-house proceed\u00adings. Section I.A offers a description of SEC in-house enforcement capabilities before and after Dodd-Frank, with a short subsection devoted to correcting some common misconceptions about the SEC ALJs tasked with overseeing SEC administrative proceedings. Section I.B then turns to the doctrinal framework used by Article III courts to determine whether an exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is appropriate.\r\n<h3>A. SEC Administrative Proceedings Before and After Dodd-Frank<\/h3>\r\nThis section briefly discusses the ways in which Dodd-Frank altered the SEC enforcement landscape.[footnote]For a thorough review of the SEC\u2019s institutional development, see generally Paul S. Atkins &amp; Bradley J. Bondi, Evaluating The Mission: A Critical Review of the History and Evolution of the SEC Enforcement Program, 13 Fordham J. Corp. &amp; Fin. L. 367 (2008). For a more targeted examination of the SEC\u2019s expansion of power via Dodd-Frank, see Giles D. Beal IV, Judge, Jury, and Executioner: SEC Administrative Law Judges Post-Dodd Frank, 20 N.C. Banking Inst. 413, 413 (2016) (\u201cDodd-Frank extended SEC ALJs\u2019 ability to levy civil penalties on non-registered individuals and entities, while simultaneously expanding the range of penalties available to ALJs in administrative hearings.\u201d).[\/footnote] The intent here is not to exhaustively chronicle changes to the SEC\u2019s regulatory apparatus but rather to high\u00adlight several modifications that have stoked industry ire and raised an array of constitutional eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether or not to grant exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to SEC administrative proceedings can appear to be a trivial or anomalous feature of a recent string of circuit cases, unless one appreciates the extent to which Dodd-Frank expanded SEC discretion and emboldened the Commission to prosecute in-house. In order to avoid muddying the waters of this discussion, this section simply provides a targeted snapshot of SEC administrative proceedings before (section I.A.1) and after (section I.A.2) Dodd-Frank\u2014rather than investigating the interim dynamics that catalyzed these changes\u2014before briefly addressing several common misconceptions regarding the nature of the ALJs tasked with overseeing these internal adjudications (section I.A.3). Section I.B then explains how the changes introduced by Dodd-Frank intersect with the doctrinal framework governing the question of exclu\u00adsive subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n1. <em>SEC Administrative Proceedings Before Dodd-Frank.<\/em> \u2014 Even before Dodd-Frank, the SEC was authorized under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and subsequent rules and amendments thereto, to pursue internal administrative proceedings as an alternative to bringing enforce\u00adment actions in federal district court.[footnote]See Joseph A. Grundfest, Fair or Foul?: SEC Administrative Proceedings and Prospects for Reform Through Removal Legislation, 85 Fordham L. Rev. 1143, 1145 n.4 (2016) [hereinafter Grundfest, Fair or Foul] (\u201cThe SEC has used administrative proceedings as an alternative to federal court litigation since the SEC\u2019s inception.\u201d); Tessa Stillings, Are the SEC\u2019s Administrative Law Courts Constitutional?: Recent Developments in the SEC\u2019s Increased Use of Administrative Proceedings, 35 Rev. Banking &amp; Fin. L. 96, 97 (2015) (\u201cThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. created the SEC and gave the agency the power to \u2018bring \u201cadministrative proceedings\u201d against regulated persons or entities who are alleged violators of the securities laws.\u2019\u201d (quoting Robert N.

The Supreme Court held early on that the SEC is permitted to develop new regulatory rules via these internal adjudications. See, e.g., SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947) (\u201cHence we refuse to say that the Commission, which had not previously been confronted with the problem of management trading during reorganization, was forbidden from utilizing [an administrative proceeding] for announcing and applying a new standard of conduct.\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, internal enforcement at the SEC preceded the SEC Division of Enforcement itself, as administra\u00adtive adjudication before the 1972 establishment of the Division simply took place in various decentralized SEC divisions.[footnote]Daniel M. Hawke, SEC Historical Soc\u2019y, Roundtable on Enforcement: A Brief History of the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Program 1934\u20131981, at 2 (2002), http:\/\/3197d6d14b5f19f2f440-5e13d29c4c016cf96cbbfd197c579b45.r81.cf1.rackcdn.com\/collection\/papers\/2000\/2002_0925_enforcementHistory.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/J7VA-WTXX] (\u201cIn August 1972, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission established its Division of Enforcement. Prior to this time, responsibility for enforcing the federal securities laws had been decentralized among the Commission\u2019s various operating divisions and regional offices.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhen the SEC chooses to bring an enforcement action internally\u2014at least since the inception of the SEC Division of Enforcement\u2014the SEC Division of Enforcement acts as a party to the dispute and aims to prove the SEC\u2019s case in front of an ALJ.[footnote]Beal, supra note 15, at 416.[\/footnote] Thereafter, \u201c[t]he ALJ\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. pre\u00adsides over the matter, including the evidentiary hearing, and issues an initial decision.\u201d[footnote]Thomas Glassman, Ice Skating Up <em>Hill<\/em>: Constitutional Challenges to SEC Administrative Proceedings, 16 J. Bus. &amp; Sec. L. 47, 52 (2016).[\/footnote] If a defendant loses before an ALJ, the defendant then may petition for the SEC to review the case de novo.[footnote]Id. at 53. Some have argued that this arrangement is circular. See, e.g., Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1162 (\u201cCritics also complain that the first-level appeal from the ALJ\u2019s decision is not to a federal court, but to the very same Commission that authorized the proceeding in the initial instance.\u201d); Eaglesham, In-House Judges, supra note 2 (arguing defendants appealing to the SEC will receive a decision from the \u201csame body that decided the case against [the defendants] should go forward in the first place\u201d). That being said, the Supreme Court has long condoned the practice of agency enforcement proceeding in-house. Stephen J. Choi &amp; A.C. Pritchard, The SEC\u2019s Shift to Administrative Proceedings: An Empirical Assessment, 34 Yale J. on Reg. 1, 3 (2017).[\/footnote] A party that loses in front of the SEC itself can petition for review by a federal court of appeals, either in the aggrieved party\u2019s home circuit or the D.C. Circuit.[footnote]15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a078y(a)(1) (2012); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a0201.410(e) (2017) (\u201cPursuant to Section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act,\u00a0a petition to the Commission for review of an initial decision is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d (citation omitted)); see also Hill v.

Dodd-Frank was not the first expansion of SEC enforcement power, but its alteration of these key structural limitations vis-\u00e0-vis jurisdictional discretion and punitive capabilities differentiates Dodd-Frank from prior adjustments to the SEC\u2019s enforcement capabilities and seems to be the catalyst behind the recent outpouring of public criticism. Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1148 (describing, colorfully, Dodd-Frank\u2019s effect by noting that \u201c[i]t was as though a dam holding back pent up rage about the fairness of the Commission\u2019s administrative proceedings had suddenly burst\u201d). Consider the Penny Stock Reform Act (PSRA) of 1990, a major expansion of SEC enforcement power that many characterize as the modern source of ALJ prominence. 3D Harold S. Bloomenthal &amp; Samuel Wolff, Securities and Federal Corporate Law \u00a7\u00a020:15 (2d ed. 2017) (\u201cThe Commission\u2019s extensive areas of adjudication and remedies in such adjudication were significantly broadened by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Bob Van Voris &amp; Matt Robinson, For the SEC\u2019s In-House Court, a Question of Justice for All, Bloomberg (Aug. 10, 2015), http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-08-10\/for-the-sec-s-in-house-court-a-question-of-justice-for-all (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). The PSRA allowed the SEC to bring suits for <em>punitive <\/em>rather than simply remedial disgorgement penalties, including the ability to bar or revoke securities licenses in some instances. David Zaring, Enforcement Discretion at the SEC, 94 Tex. L. Rev. 1155, 1164\u201365 (2016) [hereinafter Zaring, Enforcement Discretion]. And yet, while the PSRA increased the strength of the SEC\u2019s hand both with respect to settlement and adjudications themselves, it also \u201cleft the federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction over cases where the securities laws were violated but the defendants were not licensed to practice before the Commission.\u201d Id. at 1165.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt the risk of blurring history through generalization, several com\u00admentators seem to agree that in the early days of the SEC, and certainly in the days before Dodd-Frank, the SEC was both relatively constrained by Congress with respect to its choice of forum and, as a policy choice, less inclined to make frequent use of administrative proceedings. Both of these factors contributed to a regulatory ecosystem in which defendants viewed SEC administrative proceedings as largely noncontroversial.[footnote]See, e.g., Beal, supra note 15, at 416 (\u201cHistorically, congressional limitations on which proceedings could be brought in front of ALJs along with the SEC\u2019s infrequent use of ALJs resulted in little discontent among defendants participating in administrative law proceedings.\u201d); Ryan Jones, The Fight over Home Court: An Analysis of the SEC\u2019s Increased Use of Administrative Proceedings, 68 SMU L.

Another possible contributing factor to this lack of controversy is the fact that formal administrative adjudication dates back to before even the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), thereby ingraining the legitimacy of the practice in the collective consciousness of the regulated community.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2. <em>SEC Administrative Proceedings After Dodd-Frank<\/em>. \u2014 Dodd-Frank was signed into law in July 2010 amid the tumultuous aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.[footnote]Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.

As a fascinating aside, Rakoff points out that \u201cthe sole legislative history of Section 929P(a) in the House Report on Dodd-Frank states that \u2018This section streamlines the SEC\u2019s existing enforcement authorities by permitting the SEC to seek civil money penalties in cease-and-desist proceedings under Federal securities laws.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6 (quoting H.R.

The simplest explanation of the backlash seems to be the concerted policy effort by the SEC to bring a <em>significantly<\/em> larger percentage of cases in-house[footnote]See supra note 27 and accompanying text (providing data on the SEC\u2019s increased use of in-house proceedings); see also supra note 34 and accompanying text (noting the SEC\u2019s announced policy decision to channel more cases in-house).[\/footnote] coupled with the industry\u2019s suspicion, whether or not empirically supported, that cases brought before ALJs are more likely to return a favorable outcome for the SEC. One frequently cited piece observed that the SEC achieved favorable results in ninety percent of internal SEC proceedings between October 2010 and March 2015, compared to in sixty-nine percent of fed\u00aderal court cases during the same timeframe.[footnote]See Eaglesham, In-House Judges, supra note 2 (observing that \u201c[t]he commissioners decided in their own agency\u2019s favor concerning 53 out of 56 defendants in appeals\u201d from January 2010 to March 2015); see also Rachel E.

But see Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1182\u201384 (questioning the reliability of some empirical arguments accusing the SEC of wielding a statistically significant in-house advantage and of arguments attempting to counter these accusations); Velikonja, Are the SEC\u2019s ALJs Biased?, supra note 4, at 366 (\u201c[T]he data in this debate is no trump card.\u201d).\r\nWhat both sides of the empirical debate may fail to fully appreciate is the extent to which the <em>perception<\/em> of unfairness undercuts the legitimacy of the SEC in much the same way as actual unfairness. Even if empirical gamesmanship accusations reflect nothing more than industry paranoia, the appearance of impropriety that emerges from guiding more actions in front of SEC ALJs (coupled with the reluctance of the federal courts to entertain constitutional challenges to this arrangement) seems likely to draw into question the SEC\u2019s credibility. Cf. Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1153 (\u201cTypically, when a plaintiff selects a forum, the factfinder is not in the plaintiff\u2019s employ, the appeal is not to the plaintiff itself, and the plaintiff does not control the rules governing the proceeding.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe upshot has been clear: In the aftermath of Dodd-Frank, the SEC, invigorated with a significant expansion of enforcement capabilities and unaltered discretion as to when the Commission can bring enforcement actions in (purportedly SEC-favorable) administrative proceedings, began to bring more cases internally as opposed to in federal court.[footnote]Stillings, supra note 16, at 99 (\u201cA year before Dodd-Frank was enacted, the SEC filed 53% of its cases in the [administrative law courts], and by the end of 2014, 81% of the SEC\u2019s cases were filed in-house.\u201d); Jean Eaglesham, SEC Is Steering More Trials to Judges It Appoints, Wall St. J.

More pointedly: If parties feel that they do not have an opportunity for meaningful review\u2014in federal court\u2014of claims criticizing the very structure of the SEC ALJ enforcement apparatus, the industry frustration may very well continue to generate unnecessary litigation costs and perhaps even political backlash against the SEC, impeding the SEC\u2019s ability to pursue its goal to \u201cprotect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.\u201d SEC, What We Do, http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/about\/whatwedo.shtml [http:\/\/perma.cc\/2ZLS-RHMV] (last updated June 10, 2013).[\/footnote] The regu\u00adlated community has made essentially the following argument: First, the SEC is directing cases in-house more frequently[footnote]Eaglesham, In-House Judges, supra note 2 (\u201c[H]undreds of decisions show[] how much of a home-court advantage the SEC enjoys when it sends cases to its own judges rather than federal courts.

Exclusive Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Administrative Proceedings<\/h3>\r\nHaving discussed some of the most salient changes to SEC adminis\u00adtrative enforcement vis-\u00e0-vis Dodd-Frank, and by implication the motiva\u00adtion for industry actors to challenge the SEC\u2019s emboldened behav\u00adior, this section turns to the doctrinal framework governing these challenges. Section I.B.1 introduces the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> framework implicated by questions of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in admin\u00adistrative pro\u00adceedings. Section I.B.2 then reviews the jurisprudential backdrop to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> alongside a brief discussion of administrative preclusion and exhaustion.\r\n\r\n1. <em>The Doctrinal Framework: <\/em>Thunder Basin<em> Factors.<\/em> \u2014 When the SEC, or any government agency for that matter,[footnote]For an example of this type of constitutional challenge in the context of the CFPB, see John Doe Co. v. CFPB, 849 F.3d 1129, 1134\u201335 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (approvingly citing <em>Tilton<\/em> and referencing the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors to analyze the constitutional challenge to the CFPB).[\/footnote] elects to bring an action via administrative proceeding as opposed to in federal district court, the party subject to the enforcement action may challenge any or all aspects of the nature of the administrative proceeding itself.[footnote]See, e.g., Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236, 1239 (11th Cir. 2016) (challenging the SEC ALJ proceeding on Article II Appointments Clause grounds, among other constitutional claims); Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 768 (7th Cir. 2015) (challenging the SEC ALJ proceeding on equal protection grounds, among other constitutional claims). For a well-done summary of recent constitutional challenges to SEC administrative proceedings, see Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 11\u201322.[\/footnote] In the typical case in the context of SEC administrative proceedings, the target of the SEC\u2019s in-house enforcement action seeks to enjoin the SEC in an Article III court from further pursuing the internal enforcement;[footnote]See Gupta v. SEC, 796 F. Supp. 2d 503, 506 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (\u201cIn response to this seeming exercise in [SEC] forum-shopping, [Defendant] promptly filed in this Court a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. against the SEC.\u201d).[\/footnote] the SEC then responds by asserting that the statutory framework authorizing the inter\u00adnal enforcement scheme precludes review by an Article III court pending conclusion of the administrative proceeding.[footnote]See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 489 (2010) (noting the government argument that the administrative scheme provided an \u201cexclusive route to review\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt this point, the reviewing Article III court faces the dilemma of deter\u00admining whether or not it has jurisdiction over the request for injunc\u00adtive relief on constitutional grounds.[footnote]See, e.g., Duka v. SEC, 103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 390 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (\u201cThe Court notes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that the issue being reviewed here is whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim for injunctive and declaratory relief.\u201d), abrogated by Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] If the statute at issue does not expressly preclude federal court jurisdiction,[footnote]Section 701(a)(1) of the APA provides that judicial review may be expressly pre\u00adcluded by the relevant organic act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0701 (2012).[\/footnote] the court must resolve the jurisdictional question with a view to implicit delegation or withhold\u00ading of jurisdiction.[footnote]See <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 281 (\u201cThe statutes that establish the SEC\u2019s scheme of administrative and judicial review, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Advisers Act, do not expressly preclude federal district court jurisdiction over the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim. The crucial jurisdictional issue\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is whether the statutes do so implicitly.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this question, courts look to <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich<\/em>, which lays out a general framework within which courts are instructed to consider whether Congress intended to limit the jurisdic\u00adtion of federal courts pending the conclusion of an agency proceeding.[footnote]510 U.S. 200 (1994).[\/footnote] In <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>itself, the petitioning mine operator refused to comply with a regulation of the Department of Labor\u2019s Mine Safety and Health Administration requiring mine operators to publicly post cer\u00adtain union representative information, promulgated pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977.[footnote]Id. at 202\u201304.[\/footnote] Instead, petitioner \u201cfiled suit in the United States District Court\u201d and the \u201cDistrict Court enjoined respondents from enforcing [the regulation]\u201d on grounds that requiring the petitioner to challenge the interpretation of the Act in the statutory review process would constitute a Fifth Amendment Due Process violation.[footnote]Id. at 205\u201306.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision, concluding that the Act \u201cpreclude[d] district court jurisdiction over the pre-enforcement challenge made\u201d and that judicial review \u201cin the appropriate court of appeals\u201d is precluded until comple\u00adtion of the administrative review.[footnote]Id. at 206\u201308.[\/footnote] The Court identified three factors to help lower courts determine whether Congress intends, absent an explicit directive, to limit Article III court jurisdiction over such challenges:\r\n<blockquote>[W]e presume that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdic\u00adtion [1] if \u201ca finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review\u201d; [2] if the suit is \u201cwholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and [3] if the claims are \u201cout\u00adside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d[footnote]Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 489 (2010) (quoting <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, 510 U.S. at 212\u201313).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe so-called \u201c<em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors\u201d have remained operative, with little substantive change, in the years since <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> was decided.[footnote]It is worth emphasizing, particularly given the focus of this Note, that not a single Supreme Court case since <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> has explicitly questioned the framework itself; instead, courts adhere closely to the factors identified and vigorously debate application to the facts at hand. See, e.g., Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 15\u201316 (2012) (quoting the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors); <em>Free Enter.<\/em>, 561 U.S. at 489 (citing <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> as the appropriate framework).[\/footnote] The continued utility of the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>test seems to reflect, in part, a dual intuition that the administrative state is the proper forum for cer\u00adtain claims but not others (for example, constitutional claims) and the desire to give aggrieved parties the opportunity for meaningful judicial review before Article III judges.[footnote]Cf. <em>Elgin<\/em>, 567 U.S. at 16 (\u201c[A]djudication of the constitutionality of congressional enactments has generally been thought beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, 510 U.S. at 215)); New Orleans Pub.

The question of whether claims against an agency may be pre\u00adcluded or delayed from judicial review implicates the fairly robust bodies of administrative law on implied preclusion (which asks <em>if<\/em> judicial review will be available) and exhaustion (which asks <em>when<\/em> judicial review will be available). An in-depth discussion of either topic here is unnecessary, but even the cursory review provided below underscores three important points about these bodies of law relevant to this Note. First, courts as a gen\u00aderal matter seem to disfavor preclusion, particularly of constitutional ques\u00adtions.[footnote]See infra note 97 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Second, in cases where administrative action entails a <em>coercive<\/em> effect, courts appear skeptical of either preclusion or forcing the aggrieved party to exhaust its administrative remedies.[footnote]See infra notes 98\u201399 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Finally, notwith\u00adstanding the first and second points, courts recognize that imposing <em>no<\/em> preclusion or exhaustion requirements may improperly disrupt an administrative scheme.[footnote]See infra notes 100\u2013104 and accompanying text; see also Chau v. SEC, 72 F. Supp. 3d 417, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\u201cThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction is not an escape hatch for litigants to delay or derail an administrative action when statutory channels of review are entirely adequate.\u201d), aff\u2019d, 665 F. App\u2019x 67 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPreclusion is grounded in the language of the APA. Under \u00a7\u00a0701(a)(1) of the APA, judicial review is available \u201cexcept to the extent that\u2014(1) statutes preclude judicial review.\u201d[footnote]5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0701 (2012).[\/footnote] While there is an interest\u00ading line of cases demonstrating the ability of courts to creatively provide for review even in cases of <em>express<\/em> preclusion,[footnote]See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 368 n.9 (1974) (finding \u201cfinal and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review\u201d as not preclusive); Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 51 (1955) (finding \u201cfinal\u201d in the organic act not preclusive).[\/footnote] more pertinent here is the question of <em>implied<\/em> preclusion, as the SEC has not, to date, argued that judicial review of parallel constitutional challenges was <em>expressly<\/em> pre\u00adcluded by Congress.[footnote]See, e.g., Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir. 2016) (framing the discussion in terms of implied preclusion); Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 768 (7th Cir. 2015) (same).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUnder the doctrine of implied preclusion, the Supreme Court has held that the presumption of judicial review is a \u201cheavy burden\u201d[footnote]Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 672 (1986).[\/footnote] to overcome but also that this presumption may be countered when congres\u00adsional intent to preclude is \u201cfairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\u201d[footnote]Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 351 (1984) (\u201c[T]he presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d).[\/footnote] The Court has held that the presumption of review is strongest in cases raising questions of constitutional or statutory interpretation.[footnote]See, e.g., <em>Bowen<\/em>, 476 U.S. at 678 (\u201c[I]t is implausible to think [Congress] intended that there be <em>no<\/em> forum to adjudicate statutory and constitutional challenges\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Oestereich v. Selective Serv. Sys. Local Bd. No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 242 (1968) (\u201cAdjudication of the constitutionality of congressional enactments has generally been thought beyond the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn <em>Sackett v. EPA<\/em>, a relatively recent treatment of implied preclu\u00adsion, the Supreme Court refused to find a challenge to the issuance of an EPA compliance order (these orders entail potential fines of up to $75,000 per day for noncompliance) precluded from judicial review. [footnote]566 U.S. 120, 131 (2012).[\/footnote] The Court specifically rejected the Government\u2019s \u201cefficiency\u201d argument, that is, that compliance orders \u201ccan obtain quick remediation through volun\u00adtary compliance\u201d with the Clean Water Act:\r\n<blockquote>The APA\u2019s presumption of judicial review is a repudiation of the principle that efficiency of regulation conquers all. And there is no reason to think the [Act] was uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of regulated parties\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. without the oppor\u00adtunity for judicial review.[footnote]Id. at 130\u201331.

Community Nutrition Institute <\/em>(<em>C<\/em><em>NI<\/em>) illus\u00adtrates the Court\u2019s countervailing concern with <em>excessive<\/em> access to judicial review.[footnote]467 U.S. at 347\u201348 (describing how expanding judicial review would give regulated entities ways to circumvent the administrative procedures prescribed by Congress).[\/footnote] In <em>CNI<\/em>, the Court refused to allow individual milk <em>consumers<\/em> to challenge milk market orders issued under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.[footnote]Id. at 341.[\/footnote] The Court reasoned that access to review was intended only for milk <em>producers and handlers<\/em>, and to hold otherwise would disrupt the operation of the scheme enacted by Congress.[footnote]Id. at 348 (\u201cAllowing consumers to sue the Secretary would severely disrupt this complex and delicate administrative scheme.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>CNI <\/em>also provides an instructive segue to the closely related doctrine of exhaustion, which in some cases requires parties to present their argu\u00adments to the relevant agency before bringing these arguments into an Article III court. Although later cases have seemingly stymied the long\u00adstanding practice of judicial superimposition of exhaustion require\u00adments on top of the APA,[footnote]See, e.g., Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993).[\/footnote] <em>CNI<\/em> recognized the potential disruption that might result from parties using the presumption of reviewability to avoid exhaustion of administrative remedies: \u201cIt would provide handlers with a convenient device for evading the statutory requirement that they first exhaust their administrative remedies.\u201d[footnote]<em>CNI<\/em>, 467 U.S. at 348.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt the crux of this tension\u2014between impeding the ability of agen\u00adcies to function and depriving regulated entities from meaningful review\u2014lies <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>. <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> cobbled together several of the cases cited above, in addition to various others,[footnote]For example, the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> Court referenced <em>Mathews v. Eldridge<\/em> as an instance in which the Court found that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0405(g), the organic act at issue, required administrative exhaustion of Social Security disability benefits claims, but <em>not<\/em> of the constitutional due process questions raised simultaneously. Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 213 (1994) (citing Mathews v.

The <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> decision itself reflected the difficulty that courts face in determin\u00ading when judicial review will be \u201cmeaningful,\u201d suggesting in one instance that eventual judicial review can be meaningful,[footnote]Id. at 215 (finding that eventual review by the relevant court of appeals would provide meaningful judicial review).[\/footnote] while suggesting in another that eventual judicial review may lack meaning when parties cannot obtain \u201cfull postdeprivation relief.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 213.[\/footnote] The <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors provide a clear example of law implicating policy. As such, in keeping with the line of cases leading to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, courts are likely to achieve the best results by tying decisions to the practicalities of the par\u00adticular scheme at issue.\r\n<h2>II. Backlash: Constitutional Challenges and <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em><\/h2>\r\nThe recent line of cases leading to and including <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em> illus\u00adtrates the three general problems that have been exacerbated by Article III courts refusing to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitu\u00adtional challenges to SEC administrative proceedings pending completion of the administrative action. First, reading <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> to imply that \u201cmeaningful\u201d review is satisfied by any <em>eventual<\/em> review[footnote]Chau v. SEC, 72 F. Supp. 3d 417, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (holding that defendants seeking to enjoin administrative proceedings \u201cmust patiently await the denouement of proceedings within the Article II branch\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting USAA Fed. Sav. Bank v. McLaughlin, 849 F.2d 1505, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1988))), aff\u2019d, 665 F. App\u2019x 67 (2d Cir. 2016). While \u201ceventual\u201d review is often enough to moot claims of improper preclusion, courts appear generally less likely to preclude jurisdiction or require exhaustion when constitutional issues are raised or when the administrative action entails a coercive effect, as discussed above.

Second, given the incentive for parties to settle prior to reaching a trial, administrative or otherwise, this cabining of constitutional challenges constrains the ability of Article III courts to develop administrative and constitutional law. Third, the insulation of SEC administrative proceed\u00adings from constitutional challenge runs counter to fairness intuitions, feeding suspicions of games\u00admanship[footnote]Gamesmanship concerns have only been made more acute by the SEC\u2019s failure to articulate a clear standard for forum selection when bringing enforcement actions.

Constitutional Challenges<\/h3>\r\nThe manifestation of the industry-consternation zeitgeist vis-\u00e0-vis Dodd-Frank-induced SEC internal enforcement has been an array of attacks on the constitutionality of SEC administrative proceedings.[footnote]See, e.g., Peter J.

SEC, 844 F.3d 174, 186 (4th Cir. 2016).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Bebo v. SEC<\/em> provided the first example of a federal appeals court engaging this question of subject mat\u00adter jurisdiction.[footnote]799 F.3d 765.[\/footnote] In <em>Bebo<\/em>, after the SEC alleged that Laurie Bebo had committed various securities violations, Bebo brought suit in the district court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, alleging that the SEC\u2019s enforcement scheme violated the Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]Id. at 767.[\/footnote] The Seventh Circuit, affirming the district court, found that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a078(y), the statute governing the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme, indicated that \u201cCongress intended plaintiffs in Bebo\u2019s position \u2018to proceed exclusively through the statutory review scheme\u2019\u201d and refused to exercise subject matter jurisdiction.[footnote]Id. (quoting Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Bebo<\/em>\u2019s disposition was less significant than the Seventh Circuit\u2019s two notable observations on the<em> Thunder Basin<\/em> factors.[footnote]Note that the <em>Bebo<\/em> court refers at times to the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors as the \u201c<em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em>\u201d factors, referencing <em>Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board<\/em>, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), which, with a few glosses beyond the scope of this Note, restates the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors. See <em>Bebo<\/em>, 799 F.3d at 772. As such, to avoid confusion, this Note refers to the three-pronged test only as the \u201c<em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors.\u201d[\/footnote] First, the court con\u00adcluded that the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d prong is the most important of the three-pronged test, relegating the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside agency expertise\u201d prongs to an ambiguous role in the framework, to the extent they retain any force at all.[footnote]<em>Bebo<\/em>, 799 F.3d at 774 (\u201cWe think the most critical thread in the case law is the first <em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em> factor: whether the plaintiff will be able to receive meaningful judicial review without access to the district courts.\u201d).[\/footnote] Second, the court made clear that \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d could be satisfied by <em>any<\/em> eventual judicial review in an Article III court.[footnote]Id. (noting Bebo could \u201craise her objections in a circuit court of appeals established under Article III\u201d only \u201cafter the pending enforcement action has run its course\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s reading of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for parties to have constitutional claims heard in Article III courts prior to the conclusion of administrative pro\u00adceedings, even when these claims are outside the agency\u2019s expertise and wholly collateral to the statute\u2019s review provisions, so long as the statutory provision allows for <em>any<\/em> hearing in front of an Article III court. Indeed, this is exactly what happened in <em>Bebo<\/em>: The <em>Bebo <\/em>court conceded that \u201cBebo\u2019s suit can reasonably be characterized as \u2018wholly collateral\u2019 to the statute\u2019s review provisions and outside the scope of the agency\u2019s exper\u00adtise,\u201d and yet it still refused to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the claims because Bebo could eventually raise her complaints in the D.C. Circuit on appeal.[footnote]Id. at 767.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn rendering this final decision, the Seventh Circuit appeared pre\u00adoccupied with the possibility that allowing the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction could open the floodgates to defendants using constitutional challenges to evade SEC administrative proceedings.[footnote]Id. at 775 (\u201cEvery person hoping to enjoin an ongoing administrative proceeding could make this argument.\u201d). When this question ultimately reached the Fourth Circuit, the court raised a similar concern. See Bennett v. SEC, 844 F.3d 174, 188 (4th Cir. 2016) (\u201cAdopting Bennett\u2019s argument would provide no limiting principle: Anyone could bypass the judicial-review scheme established by Congress simply by alleging a constitutional challenge and framing it as \u2018structural,\u2019 \u2018prophylactic,\u2019 or \u2018preventative.\u2019\u201d).[\/footnote] Rather than risk introducing a potential avenue of evasion, the court raised a formidable jurisdictional barrier.[footnote]Cf. Jones, supra note 28, at 522 (noting that, if one assumes <em>any<\/em> judicial review will be meaningful, \u201cmeaningful judicial review will virtually always exist, and the claim would fail the first prong of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> test\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Bebo<\/em> requires parties to undergo the expense and negative publicity associated with an SEC prosecution and to endure several layers of adminis\u00adtrative review prior to the hearing of constitutional arguments before an Article III court, at which point the damage of the allegedly unconstitu\u00adtional proceeding will have already been done.[footnote]<em>Bebo<\/em>, 799 F.3d at 775 (explicitly rejecting Bebo\u2019s argument that \u201cby the time she is able to seek judicial review in a court of appeals, she will have already been subjected to an unconstitutional proceeding\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, in all likelihood the case will at that point have been settled.[footnote]See supra note 52.[\/footnote] Some obser\u00advers, surprised with this implication, predicted <em>Bebo<\/em> would become an outlier for its jurisdictional holding.[footnote]See, e.g., Joseph Quincy Patterson, Note, Many Key Issues Still Left Unaddressed in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Attempt to Modernize Its Rules of Practice, 91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1675, 1691 (2016) (\u201cCurrently, <em>Bebo<\/em> seems to be the exception, and more courts are deciding that defendants have subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis intuition was proven incorrect in <em>Jarkesy v. SEC<\/em>.[footnote]803 F.3d 9 (D.C. Cir. 2015).[\/footnote] Because <em>Jarkesy<\/em> gave voice to several policy concerns with allowing parallel subject matter jurisdiction for constitutional challenges to SEC in-house proce\u00addures, it merits close attention.\r\n\r\nIn <em>Jarkesy<\/em>, the SEC brought an administrative enforcement action against George Jarkesy, Jr. on the basis of alleged securities fraud.[footnote]Id. at 12.[\/footnote] After Jarkesy countered with a parallel suit in D.C. district court raising several constitutional challenges to the proceeding, the district court found Congress had \u201cimplicitly precluded concurrent district-court jurisdic\u00adtion.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] On appeal, the D.C. Circuit applied the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors and upheld the preclusion. Judge Srikanth Srinivasan, writing for the court, provided the following <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>gloss:\r\n<blockquote>We do not understand those considerations to form three dis\u00adtinct inputs into a strict mathematical formula. Rather, the con\u00adsiderations are general guideposts useful for channeling the inquiry into whether the particular claims at issue fall outside an overarching congressional design.[footnote]Id. at 17.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nJudge Srinivasan did not cite to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> to support this interpretive proposition. This is not to suggest Judge Srinivasan was necessarily incorrect in re\u00adfusing to \u201cmathematically\u201d apply the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors but rather to underscore the fact that the <em>Jarkesy<\/em> opinion appears to implicitly blur the factors and consequently privilege the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d fac\u00adtor over the remaining two. Perhaps more tellingly, Judge Srinivasan specifically noted, with approval, that the <em>Bebo<\/em> court appeared to merge several of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> steps in the fashion discussed above.[footnote]Id. at 22 (\u201c[T]he Seventh Circuit declined to find\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. jurisdiction on [the basis of meaningful judicial review] alone, which the court viewed to be the \u2018most critical\u2019 factor.\u201d); see also Chau v. SEC, 665 F. App\u2019x 67, 70 (2d Cir. 2016) (echoing the sentiment that \u201c[the court has] recognized that the first factor\u2014meaningful judicial review\u2014is most important\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Jarkesy<\/em> is noteworthy for two additional background elements that suggest an awareness of the general industry tumult reviewed above and a tendency toward defensive opining: First, the D.C. Circuit seemed con\u00adcerned that defendants like Jarkesy could use facial attacks on the constitutionality of a statute to deflect any SEC administrative enforce\u00adment to the federal forum.[footnote]<em>Jarkesy<\/em>, 803 F.3d at 25 (\u201c[A]n exception to an otherwise exclusive scheme for constitutional challenges in general\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would encourage respondents\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to frame their challenges to the [SEC\u2019s] actions in those terms.\u201d).[\/footnote] Second, the court indicated that the logistical kerfuffle and cost that would be permitted by exercising juris\u00addiction could throw into disarray the entire framework established by Congress.[footnote]Id. at 29 (\u201cThe rationale underlying Congress\u2019s decision to create statutory schemes like the one before us is that \u2018coherence and economy are best served if all suits pertaining to designated agency decisions are segregated in particular courts.\u2019\u201d (quoting City of Rochester v. Bond, 603 F.2d 927, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1982))).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Bebo <\/em>and <em>Jarkesy<\/em> demonstrate two crucial points: First, the courts evinced, not necessarily unreasonably, concern that exercising subject matter jurisdiction over these constitutional challenges could open the floodgates to use of these challenges as a dilatory vehicle[footnote]Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 773 (7th Cir. 2015) (concluding, among other things, that the court ought to consider \u201cwhether the constitutional claims are being raised as a \u2018vehicle\u2019 to challenge agency action taken during an administrative proceeding\u201d).[\/footnote] or, worse, a large-scale attack on the administrative state. Second, both courts read the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> three-factor test as prioritizing consideration of \u201cmeaningful judicial review,\u201d but with that factor interpreted purely as \u201ceventual\u201d judicial review. It is this second doctrinal mutation that comes to the fore in <em>Tilton<\/em>, and with which Judge Christopher Droney in dissent took issue.\r\n<h3>B. Tilton and Its Implications<\/h3>\r\nThis section provides a close reading of <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em>; such a reading suggests that the <em>Tilton<\/em> court ignored the fact that, even if the \u201cmeaning\u00adful judicial review\u201d prong of <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> overpowers in some sense the other two, review cannot be meaningful if defendants must suffer the very harm, that is, the reputational and expense costs of litigation (not to mention alleged constitutional impropriety), that they seek to enjoin.[footnote]For analogous reasoning, see Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. SEC, 609 F.2d 570, 577 (2d Cir. 1979) (\u201c[T]o require appellants to exhaust their administrative remedies would be to require them to submit to the very procedures which they are attacking.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n1. Tilton<em> Background.<\/em> \u2014 In March 2015, the SEC initiated an in-house proceeding against Lynn Tilton, known affectionately as the \u201cDiva of Distressed\u201d for her work with troubled companies,[footnote]Nate Raymond, SEC, \u2018Diva of Distressed\u2019 Tilton Face Off in Fraud Trial, Reuters (Oct. 24, 2016), http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-sec-tilton-idUSKCN12O2MM [http:\/\/perma.cc\/5G2L-647H].[\/footnote] for alleged violations of the Investment Advisers Act.[footnote]Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 280 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] The SEC alleged Tilton defrauded investors by mischaracterizing assets of her fund Patriarch Partners.[footnote]Raymond, supra note 141.[\/footnote] Tilton then filed suit in the Southern District of New York seeking an injunction, raising the affirmative defense that the in-house proceeding was unconstitutional because the presiding ALJ\u2019s appoint\u00adment violated Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause.[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 280. On the one hand, the nature of the challenge seems to entail an implausible outcome, insofar as it could destabilize much of the administrative state or at the very least require rethinking of the appointment and behavior of the ALJs active not only at the SEC but also at other administrative agencies. Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 17 (\u201cALJs are utilized across the federal bureaucracy. A judicial ruling finding them unconstitutional\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would be potentially transformative.\u201d (footnote omitted)); Philip J. Griffin, Comment, Developments in SEC Administrative Proceedings: An Evaluation of Recent Appointment Clause Challenges, the Rapidly Evolving Judicial Landscape, and the SEC\u2019s Response to Critics, 19 U. Pa. J. Bus. L. 209, 228 (2016) (\u201cA Supreme Court determination that the SEC\u2019s ALJ appointment process is unconstitutional would affect not only the SEC, but also all 31 other federal administrative agencies, which together appoint more than 1,300 ALJs.\u201d). Indeed, depending on one\u2019s views as to the degree of implausibility, one might take the more extreme position that these challenges are so \u201cobjectively unreasonable in constitutional law\u201d as to be a form of \u201cconstitutional bad faith.\u201d David E. Pozen, Constitutional Bad Faith, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 885, 933 (2016). On the other hand, this was not enough to stop a recent Tenth Circuit panel in Bandimere v. SEC, 844 F.3d 1168, 1188 (10th Cir. 2016), from accepting an Appointments Clause challenge identical to that put forth by <em>Tilton<\/em>, splitting with the opposite holding of the D.C. Circuit in Raymond J. Lucia Cos. v. SEC, 832 F.3d 277 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Indeed, after the D.C. Circuit declined to rehear <em>Lucia<\/em> en banc, Lucia v. SEC, 868 F.3d 1021, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 2017), the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari on January 12, 2018. Lucia v. SEC, No. 17-130, 2018 WL 386565 (Jan. 12, 2018). For background on the <em>Bandimere<\/em> challenge and its significance, see generally Casey M. Olesen, Case Note,\u00a0Creating Mischief: The Tenth Circuit Declares the SEC\u2019s Administrative Law Judges Unconstitutional in <em>Bandimere v. Securities Exchange Commission<\/em>, 70 Me. L.

SEC, 103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 382 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (holding that the Article III court had subject matter jurisdiction over the constitutional claims), abrogated by <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d 276; Gupta v. SEC, 796 F. Supp. 2d 503, 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (same).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOn appeal to the Second Circuit, Tilton argued that the failure of the SEC to appoint ALJs in accordance with the Appointments Clause rendered the administrative proceeding unconstitutional, warranting a permanent injunction of the administrative proceeding.[footnote]Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 10\u201311, 30\u201343, <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d 276 (No. 15-2103), 2015 WL 4400932.[\/footnote] As such, the ongoing proceeding would \u201citself constitute a grave constitutional injury that could not be redressed after the fact.\u201d[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 283.[\/footnote] To support this position, Tilton raised, among others, the following related arguments: First, <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> has been understood to evaluate \u201cnot whether denying district court jurisdiction could preclude <em>all<\/em> judicial review, but rather, whether such a denial would preclude all \u2018meaningful\u2019 judicial review.\u201d[footnote]Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants, supra note 147, at 17 (citing <em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em> as an example of this approach to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>).[\/footnote] Second, forcing exhaustion upon Tilton would lead to meaningless review in that it would fail to offer the relief sought, that is, an injunction to block an allegedly unconstitutional proceeding, and force injury upon Tilton in the form of \u201cthe attendant \u2018embarrassment, expense,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. ordeal[,]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

Writing for the majority, Judge Robert Sack reviewed the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors in the mode endorsed by <em>Bebo<\/em> and <em>Jarkesy<\/em>: Judge Sack acknowledged that the questions of whether the suit was \u201cwholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d and whether the claims were \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d presented close calls,[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 282.[\/footnote] but stressed that the Appointments Clause claim <em>would<\/em> be subject to meaningful judicial review through administrative channels and that this \u201cweigh[ed] strongly against district court jurisdiction.\u201d[footnote]Id. Judge Sack tellingly cited <em>Bebo<\/em> to support the proposition that meaningful judicial review is the \u201cmost important\u201d <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factor. Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn refusing to exercise jurisdiction, Judge Sack specifically rejected the argument that review cannot be meaningful as a product of \u201cinher\u00adent remedial limitations of post-proceeding review,\u201d and made clear, as did the <em>Bebo<\/em> and <em>Jarkesy <\/em>courts, that \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d may be satisfied by \u201cany\u201d judicial review.[footnote]Id. at 284 (noting the key to \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d is the \u201caccessibility of post-proceeding review by a federal court of appeals,\u201d not the adequacy of post-proceeding remedies). One peculiar feature here is Judge Sack\u2019s recognition that <em>Free Enterprise Fund<\/em>, heavily relied upon by Tilton to argue post-proceeding review would be meaningless, entailed a scheme that did not in fact entirely preclude review, although the remaining path to review was excessively \u201ccircuitous.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] Acknowledging that post-proceeding relief may fail to restore \u201cfinancial and emotional resources,\u201d Judge Sack nonetheless maintained that this \u201cimperfect\u201d relief \u201csuffices to vindicate the litigant\u2019s constitutional claim.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 285.[\/footnote] To support this proposition, Judge Sack pointed to <em>FTC v.

Regarding the question of whether Tilton\u2019s claim was wholly collateral to the administrative pro\u00adceeding, Judge Sack argued that the Appointments Clause claim <em>could<\/em> be \u201cnarrowly categorized as collateral to the statutory merits\u201d but was not \u201c<em>wholly<\/em> collateral to the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme more broadly,\u201d given that the claim was \u201cprocedurally intertwined\u201d with the proceed\u00ading.[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 287\u201388. As Judge Droney pointed out in dissent, this seems to effectively eliminate the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d question in any case in which an administrative proceeding has begun. Id. at 296 (Droney, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] Regarding expertise, Judge Sack briefly noted that perhaps the SEC could bring to bear its expertise in resolving factual issues related to the constitutional claims, even if this relationship between factual and constitutional issues was proven solely by the SEC\u2019s ability to \u201cobviate\u201d the need to hear Tilton\u2019s constitutional arguments with an order in favor of Tilton.[footnote]Id. at 289\u201390.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAll told, the Second Circuit added momentum to the interpretations given in <em>Bebo<\/em> and <em>Jarkesy<\/em>, finding both that \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d is the key prong of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> review and that this prong can be sat\u00adisfied by eventual review in an Article III court, even if the harm sought to be avoided has, by that time, already occurred.[footnote]See id. at 291.[\/footnote] Shortly after <em>Tilton<\/em>, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Northern District of Georgia\u2019s willing\u00adness to exercise subject matter jurisdiction, noting in part that the court \u201cagree[d] with the Second and Seventh Circuits that the first factor\u2014meaningful judicial review\u2014is \u2018the most critical thread in the case law.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Bebo v. SEC, 799 F.3d 765, 774 (7th Cir. 2015)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>Judge Droney\u2019s Dissent.<\/em> \u2014 Judge Droney\u2019s <em>Tilton<\/em> dissent provides the only example at the circuit level of serious concern regarding the prioriti\u00adzation of \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d over the remaining <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>factors. Judge Droney, seeing nothing in the case law to justify this emergent hierarchy within the <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>framework, argued that the majority\u2019s holding eviscerated the remaining two factors.[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 292 (Droney, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe majority\u2019s application of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> factors has stripped the \u2018wholly collateral\u2019 and \u2018outside the agency\u2019s expertise\u2019 factors of any significance: in its view, as long as administrative proceedings have been initiated, those two factors are always satisfied.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nJudge Droney reasoned that the majority\u2019s singular focus on whether the statutory scheme provides for Article III review (as a proxy for mean\u00adingful judicial review) changed the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> analysis from one aimed at <em>substantively<\/em> evaluating the constitutional claims at issue into one <em>procedurally<\/em> concerned with whether petitioners had the ability to eventually reach an Article III forum.[footnote]Id. at 293\u201395 (arguing the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> Court \u201cconsider[ed] the substance of the claims\u201d and \u201cmade no reference to the procedural aspects of the claim\u201d). For a similar intuition that <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> aims to encourage substantive case-specific analysis, see Chau v. SEC, 72 F. Supp. 3d 417, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\u201c<em>Thunder Basin<\/em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. teach[es] that the question of whether a special statutory scheme provides for adequate review of administrative actions involves case-specific determinations.

App\u2019x 67 (2d Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] To this end, the majority, per Judge Droney\u2019s interpretation, had misread <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> to suggest that \u201ca claim is not wholly collateral if it has been <em>raised in response to<\/em>, and so is procedurally intertwined with, an administrative proceeding,\u201d[footnote]<em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 295 (Droney, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting the <em>Tilton<\/em> majority) (emphasis added).[\/footnote] and that a claim was not outside agency expertise if the agency\u2019s decision \u201cmight fully dispose of the case.\u201d[footnote]Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 23 (2012)).[\/footnote] The end result, Judge Droney argued, was a reduction of the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201cagency expertise\u201d prongs to a binary analysis of whether or not administrative proceedings are ongoing.[footnote]Id. at 295\u201396 (suggesting this binary approach is inconsistent with <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> and its progeny). Judge Droney later points out that, under a substantive analysis of agency expertise, it is clear that \u201cthe SEC has no particular expertise in determining whether the system of appointing its [ALJs] comports with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.\u201d Id. at 297.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAfter critiquing the doctrinal shift away from <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>\u2019s \u201cholistic analysis\u201d of congressional intent, Judge Droney turned to the proverbial elephant in the Note: meaningful judicial review. Judge Droney began his discussion of meaningful judicial review by conceding that, per the majority\u2019s analysis, \u201cthis factor tends to weigh in favor of preclusion because a subsequent appeal to this Court following a final Commission order is available.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] And yet, perhaps spurred by \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201cagency expertise\u201d losing doctrinal significance in any substantive sense, Judge Droney raised the \u201csubstantial question as to whether subsequent judicial review here would be \u2018meaningful.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nJudge Droney reasoned that review cannot be meaningful if the pro\u00adceeding defendants seek to challenge has already occurred by the time defendants reach a federal court:\r\n<blockquote>Forcing the appellants to await a final Commission order before they may assert their constitutional claim in a federal court means that by the time the day for judicial review comes, they will already have suffered the injury that they are attempt\u00ading to prevent.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. In my view, this diminishes the weight of [the meaningful judicial review factor], for while there may be review, it cannot be considered truly \u201cmeaningful\u201d at that point.[footnote]Id. at 298. Another, albeit more extreme, form of Judge Droney\u2019s argument might take the position that eventual review is truly meaningless insofar as a court reviewing the constitutionality of an internal SEC proceeding after the proceeding has concluded would be forced to dismiss this challenge for mootness. See Weiss, supra note 119, at 1430 (\u201c[O]n direct review, a court would likely hold [the] challenge was moot, and thus presented a nonjusticiable question to the court. As such, the appeal would be denied without considering the merits of the challenge.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\n<a name=\"_Toc466202323\"><\/a>Judge Droney\u2019s dissent engaged the exact tension raised in the dis\u00adcussion of implied preclusion and exhaustion above.[footnote]See supra section I.B.2 (discussing the doctrinal frameworks governing implied preclusion and exhaustion).[\/footnote] In determining whether exhaustion or preclusion is appropriate, courts attempt to balance the \u201cinstitutional interest\u201d of the agency in forcing parties to proceed through administrative channels against the \u201cindividual interest\u201d in prompt Article III court review.[footnote]See, e.g., McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 146 (1992) (\u201cIn determining whether exhaustion is required, federal courts must balance the interest of the individual in retaining prompt access to a federal judicial forum against countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion.\u201d).[\/footnote] In some contexts, eventual review appears to be sufficient.[footnote]See, e.g., Mikuriya v. Leavitt, 248 F. App\u2019x 818, 820 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding the statutory scheme at issue required exhaustion unless \u201cadministrative procedures would mean denying all judicial review\u201d).[\/footnote] In other contexts, perhaps most saliently constitutional challenges or instances in which an administrative action is deemed coercive, courts appear highly uncomfortable with equating meaningful and eventual review.[footnote]See, e.g., Gray Fin. Grp., Inc. v. SEC, 166 F. Supp. 3d 1335, 1345 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (\u201c[T]he Court finds that the SEC\u2019s definition [that is, \u2018eventual judicial review\u2019] provides no <em>meaning<\/em> to the term \u2018<em>meaningful<\/em>.\u2019\u201d), vacated and remanded sub nom. Hill v. SEC, 825 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] Judge Droney is no doubt aware that preclusion is a permissible and longstanding feature of admin\u00adistrative law, but he seemed to dissent out of concern that an absolute reduction of preclusion analysis to a binary question of whether \u201ceventual\u201d review is available may not be a desirable outcome.\r\n\r\n4. Tilton <em>Epilogue.<\/em> \u2014 Suffice it to say, in light of all the foregoing, the present cocktail of industry outrage, expansion of SEC authority, and failure to grant the regulated community the opportunity for meaning\u00adful\u2014rather than \u201ceventual\u201d\u2014hearing of their constitutional complaints, is undesirable and unstable. Spirited challenges to the SEC\u2019s enforce\u00adment framework seem unlikely to subside,[footnote]See Sarah A. Good, Not the Last Challenge to SEC\u2019s Use of ALJs, Pillsbury (May 12, 2016), http:\/\/www.pillsburylaw.com\/en\/news-and-insights\/not-the-last-challenge-to-sec-s-use-of-aljs.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/S5A2-DN2C] (noting several emerging circuit splits borne out of challenges to the SEC\u2019s ALJs); supra note 144 (noting the recent creation of a circuit split on the Appointments Clause challenge to SEC ALJs).[\/footnote] the legitimacy-threatening accusations of gamesmanship seem unlikely to dissipate, and Article III courts will be impeded from developing administrative doc\u00adtrine and acting as a meaningful constitutional check on the behavior of adminis\u00adtrative agencies.[footnote]Cf. William F. Funk, To Preserve Meaningful Judicial Review, 49 Admin. L. Rev. 171, 178 (1997) (\u201cAbsent the threat of meaningful judicial review, agencies may well give short shrift to legal requirements and limitations.\u201d); Thornley &amp; Blount, supra note 25, at 281 (\u201cAll of these procedural shortcomings might be forgiven, or at least overlooked, if there were an opportunity for a meaningful appeal from the hearing. However, any appeal from an SEC ALJ\u2019s initial ruling proceeds to the SEC.\u201d). The aftermath of <em>Tilton v. SEC<\/em> is instructive in this regard. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari to Tilton\u2019s appeal from the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, Tilton ultimately won her case on the merits of the alleged securities violations, securing a dismissal from SEC ALJ Carol Fox Foelak. Lynn Tilton, SEC Release No. 1182, 117 SEC Docket 14, 2017 WL 4297256, at *49 (ALJ Sept. 27, 2017) (initial decision). One could argue that Tilton\u2019s victory before an SEC ALJ cuts against arguments of bias or gamesmanship. However, this argument fails to consider two critical points: First, Tilton\u2019s victory in defending against the securities charges ensured that her constitutional challenges never received a hearing in an Article III court, as her claims would have been moot. Second, as Tilton herself later acknowledged, her ability to spend \u201cmany tens of millions of dollars\u201d is not common to all SEC defendants, which suggests that Tilton\u2019s ability to see her defense through to a judgment on the merits may not be an option for other defendants pressured into a settlement before having the opportunity for review by the SEC Commissioners, let alone an Article III forum. See Alison Frankel, Lynn Tilton: It Took \u2018Many Tens of Millions of Dollars\u2019 to Beat Skewed SEC System, Reuters (Sept. 28, 2017), http:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/legal-us-otc-tilton\/lynn-tilton-it-took-many-tens-of-millions-of-dollars-to-beat-skewed-sec-system-idINKCN1C32ZT (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (\u201c\u2018I feel truly grateful to Judge Foelak,\u2019 Tilton said. \u2018But it doesn\u2019t change my opinion that cases like these belong in federal court.

Return to Meaningful Judicial Review<\/h2>\r\nIt should be clarified emphatically at the outset, before turning to the proposals below, that this Note is concerned with what Article III courts, the SEC, and Congress <em>should<\/em> do, rather than what each body <em>could <\/em>do within the bounds of the law. Notwithstanding the doctrinal critique\u2014a critique this author happens to believe is meritorious\u2014regarding the recent lack of faithfulness to <em>Thunder Basin<\/em>, concern with industry outrage, interest in preserving SEC legitimacy, and worry that SEC in-house prosecution may stunt Article III court development of administrative and constitutional law are all concerns of <em>policy<\/em> and insti\u00adtutional design.[footnote]Potentially, although surely not without considerable popular resistance, Congress could, pursuant to Article III, strip jurisdiction <em>entirely <\/em>from Article III courts for matters relating to securities enforcement. Daniel A. Farber, Legislative Constitutionalism in a System of Judicial Supremacy, <em>in <\/em>The Least Examined Branch: The Role of Legislatures in the Constitutional State 431, 442 (Richard W. Bauman &amp; Tsvi Kahana eds., 2006). And almost certainly, Congress has the power to amend Dodd-Frank to explicitly preclude Article III subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to ALJ proceedings pending the conclusion of the proceeding. See Griffin, supra note 144, at 221 (noting the conditions under which Congress can limit the original jurisdiction of federal district courts over constitutional claims). Arguably this type of radically revised congressional approach to the role of the Article III courts would be a more transparent method for raising the questions regarding allocation of authority between Article III courts and administrative agencies raised by this Note.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Note simply seeks to draw attention to a doctrinal development that has effectively stripped the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> evaluation of any serious attention toward substantive, <em>meaningful<\/em> review of constitutional chal\u00adlenges, which may have repercussions both insofar as it insulates the SEC from Article III court review given the incentives to settle[footnote]See supra note 52.[\/footnote] and in the sense that outright hostility from the regulated community is not a desirable policy outcome. Moreover, this niche jurisdictional question has proven a vehicle for shadowboxing over the proper role of the admin\u00adistrative state in pursuing complex statutory objectives, and as such, it offers an opportunity for more forthright dialogue between the SEC and the regulated community.\r\n\r\nThis Part proposes two solutions: (1) The SEC or Congress should promulgate detailed, and binding, forum selection guidelines, thereby reducing the impression that SEC forum decisions are arbitrary or evidence of gamesmanship; (2) future courts hearing challenges simi\u00adlar to <em>Tilton<\/em> should apply standard injunction analysis akin to <em>Duka v. SEC<\/em>.[footnote]103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 389 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), abrogated by Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276 (2d Cir. 2016); see also infra section III.B (discussing <em>Duka<\/em> in detail).[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>A. Forum Selection Guidelines<\/h3>\r\nThe SEC or Congress should clearly indicate the types of enforce\u00adment actions that will be brought internally within the SEC as opposed to those pursued in federal district court. Through this adoption of binding forum selection guidelines, private parties will be able to spend more time ensuring compliance with securities laws and preparing for the possibility of prosecution in a particular forum and less time contesting the nature of the forum. In May 2015, the SEC released a very brief commen\u00adtary on its process for forum selection.[footnote]SEC, Division of Enforcement Approach to Forum Selection in Contested Actions (2015), http:\/\/files.drinkerbiddle.com\/Templates\/media\/files\/pdfs\/SEC-Guidance(1).pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/E8DJ-D6AY]; see also Grundfest Testimony, supra note 52, at 3 (\u201c[T]he Commission has issued a statement describing four factors it considers when deciding whether to initiate proceedings in an administrative forum or in federal court. These factors have been criticized as exceptionally malleable and as not placing any meaningful limit on the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d).[\/footnote] However, this state\u00adment, identifying a \u201cnon-exhaustive list of factors\u201d to help determine the proper forum, was both nonbinding and too general to have meaningful impact on industry frustration.[footnote]Nicholas Bourtin et al., Sullivan &amp; Cromwell Discusses SEC Guidance on Approach to Forum Selection in Contested Actions, CLS Blue Sky Blog (June 15, 2015), http:\/\/clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu\/2015\/06\/15\/sullivan-cromwell-discusses-sec-guidance-on-approach-to-forum-selection-in-contested-actions\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/72RF-8X46] (noting that, notwithstanding the issuance of forum selection guidelines, the SEC maintains \u201cthe circumstances of each particular case will ultimately govern where the case is brought\u201d); see also Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 2\u20133 (\u201cThese changes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would surely be a step in the right direction if adopted. But they are too little, too late. Challengers will not be deterred and critics will not be won over unless the SEC undertakes a broader, deeper review and recalibration.\u201d).[\/footnote] That is to say, when the forum guide\u00adlines are drafted such that the SEC has enough wiggle room to effectively retain complete discretion, the guidelines will do little to assuage the regulated community\u2019s suspicions that the SEC is leveraging the forum purely to secure an advantage.\r\n\r\nProviding more specific forum selection guidelines, and binding the SEC to these guidelines, should appeal both to the regulated community insofar as it avoids being blindsided by SEC forum choice and also to the SEC, given the SEC\u2019s explicit recognition of the souring public impression of internal enforcement.[footnote]See Platt, Backlash, supra note 3, at 46 (noting that former SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar \u201csuggested the agency adopt guidelines governing the choice of forum, in order to \u2018avoid the perception that the Commission is taking its tougher cases to its in-house judges, and to ensure that all are treated fairly and equally\u201d (quoting Michael S. Piwowar, Comm\u2019r, SEC, A Fair, Orderly, and Efficient SEC, Remarks at 2015 SEC Speaks Conference (Feb. 20, 2015), http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/022015-spchcmsp.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/2C87-23P2])).[\/footnote] While \u201cindustry outrage\u201d is not necessarily itself cause for concern,[footnote]See supra note 49 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] the fact that this outrage translates to chal\u00adlenges threatening major changes to the SEC\u2019s enforcement appa\u00adratus should give the SEC reason for pause.[footnote]Consider <em>Bandimere v. SEC<\/em>, discussed above, in which the Tenth Circuit upheld an Appointments Clause challenge\u2014finding ALJs unconstitutionally appointed\u2014with far-reaching implications for the functionality of the SEC and administrative state more broadly. 844 F.3d 1168, 1188 (10th Cir. 2016).[\/footnote] If the SEC or Congress were to adopt forum selection guidelines, this would allow the SEC or Congress to take command of the SEC\u2019s future rather than wait for a potentially adverse outcome in challenges to the very nature of the SEC.\r\n\r\nSection III.A.1 argues that detailed and binding forum selection guidelines will help to bolster the SEC\u2019s legitimacy insofar as they coun\u00adter the impression that forum selection has become an exercise in pro\u00adsecutorial advantage. Section III.A.2 then presents the related argument that forum selection guidelines, regardless of the allocation codified, will serve as a starting point for a much-needed discussion over the proper scope and role of SEC internal enforcement among legisla\u00adtors, the SEC, and the regulated community.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Maintain SEC Legitimacy.<\/em> \u2014 Forum selection guidelines may go a long way toward bolstering the perceived legitimacy of the SEC as an enforcement body to the extent that these guidelines could combat the critique that the SEC is leveraging the bias of in-house judges to prosecute difficult cases.[footnote]See, e.g., Morgenson, Home-Court Edge, supra note 34 (\u201c[S]ome legal experts say these proceedings suffer from potential bias because the judges operate within the agency bringing them. The possibility of a home-court advantage or a sympathetic adjudicator, critics say, raises questions of fairness\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] That being said, several have argued that, much like the SEC\u2019s in-house judges, Article III judges have problematic biases of their own. In <em>The Real World of Arbitrariness Review<\/em>, Professors Thomas Miles and Cass Sunstein, after empirical review, conclude that judges\u2019 \u201c[p]olitical commitments\u201d significantly impacted their ability to unbiasedly review agency adjudicative decisions in cases involving the EPA and NLRB.[footnote]Thomas J. Miles &amp; Cass R. Sunstein, The Real World of Arbitrariness Review, 75 U. Chi. L. Rev. 761, 767 (2008).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Note can muster two brief responses to this objection: First, the biases of Article III judges, unlike the supposed one-directional biases of SEC ALJs, are cross-cutting\u2014that is, Democrat-appointed and Republican-appointed judges are more likely to be sympathetic to liberal and con\u00adservative agency decisions, respectively.[footnote]Id. (\u201cWhen the agency decision is liberal, the Democratic validation rate is 72 percent and the Republican validation rate is 58 percent. When the agency decision is conservative, the Democratic validation rate drops to 55 percent and the Republican validation rate rises to 72 percent.\u201d). The SEC has taken the claims of ALJ bias seriously enough to conduct an internal investigation on the matter. See supra note 68. It may very well be the case, however, that the <em>appearance<\/em> of bias is just as significant as the question of whether bias <em>actually<\/em> exists. See infra note 188 (discussing the psychological impacts of appearances of bias).[\/footnote] Second, and more importantly, regardless of the extent to which actual bias exists in either the SEC or Article III courts, it is difficult to contest the fact that a body (in this case, the SEC) with the ability to investigate, prosecute, and judge parties in-house gives rise to a somewhat troubling fairness aesthetic. If this is indeed the case, the absence of forum selection guidelines may lead skeptics to question the propriety of the SEC\u2019s forum choices, even when these choices are justified. In the words of one commentator: \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t create actual bias, it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d[footnote]Morgenson, Home-Court Edge, supra note 34 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Ronald J. Riccio, Dean Emeritus, Seton Hall Law Sch.); see also Louis L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 320 (1965) (\u201cThe availability of judicial review is the necessary condition, psychologically if not logically, of a system of administrative power which purports to be legitimate, or legally valid.\u201d); Barnett, Administrative Judges, supra note 70, at 1671 (\u201cBy prohibiting the appearance of partiality, one primarily seeks to protect the integrity of the adjudicating body and validate the process.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [A] valid process helps to validate final agency action with litigants, reviewing courts, Congress, and the public.\u201d (footnote omitted)); Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1153 (\u201cThe appearance of impropriety under these circumstances is clear, even if one believes that the administrative process is itself largely fair and efficient.\u201d).[\/footnote] In an oft-cited passage, Professor Gary Lawson outlines one stylized progression of agency enforce\u00adment that reflects the intuitive distaste for intra-agency combina\u00adtion of functions:\r\n<blockquote>Consider the typical enforcement activities of a typical federal agency\u2014for example, of the Federal Trade Commission. The Commission promulgates substantive rules of conduct. The Commission then considers whether to authorize investigations into whether the Commission\u2019s rules have been violated. If the Commission authorizes an investigation, the investigation is conducted by the Commission, which reports its findings to the Commission. If the Commission thinks that the Commission\u2019s findings warrant an enforcement action, the Commission issues a complaint. The Commission\u2019s complaint that a Commission rule has been violated is then prosecuted by the Commission and adjudicated by the Commission. This Commission adjudica\u00adtion can either take place before the full Commission or before a semi-autonomous Commission administrative law judge. If the Commission chooses to adjudicate before an administrative law judge rather than before the Commission and the decision is adverse to the Commission, the Commission can appeal to the Commission. If the Commission ultimately finds a violation, then, and <em>only<\/em> then, the affected private party can appeal to an Article III court. But the agency decision, even before the bona fide Article III tribunal, possesses a very strong presumption of correctness on matters both of fact and law.[footnote]Gary Lawson, The Rise and Rise of the Administrative State, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1231, 1248\u201349 (1994) (footnotes omitted). The Supreme Court has proven highly unreceptive to Lawson\u2019s separation of powers critique, acknowledged by Lawson himself. Id. at 1249 (\u201cThe post-New Deal Supreme Court has never seriously questioned the constitutionality of this combination of functions in agencies.\u201d). Still, there is little doubt that the modern administrative state, and agency adjudication in particular, has exerted considerable pressure on at least some traditional constitutional understandings, such that it is not impossible to imagine the regulatory community reaching a breaking point of sorts and agitating for a reinvigoration of nondelegation principles. Cf. Caleb Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 594 (2007) (describing the ways in which modern administrative adjudication has exerted pressure on the traditional \u201cpublic rights\u201d and \u201cprivate rights\u201d dichotomy).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nOne could perhaps counter with the point that SEC ALJs are well aware that they will ultimately be subjected to Article III review, however circuitous the procedure to get there, and will therefore render unbiased decisions.[footnote]There are several who take this position. See, e.g., William F. Pedersen, Jr., Formal Records and Informal Rulemaking, 85 Yale L.J. 38, 59\u201360, 70 (1975) (suggesting that judicial review of agency decisionmaking can impose \u201cuseful discipline\u201d on the agency).[\/footnote] However, the fact that most SEC enforcement actions set\u00adtle[footnote]See supra note 52 and accompanying text (discussing pressures to settle).[\/footnote] calls into question the constraining effect of subsequent judicial review. Ultimately, given the troubling aesthetic of the SEC both prose\u00adcuting and judging the same action,[footnote]Grundfest Testimony, supra note 52, at 2 (\u201cWhile respondents have the right to appeal any Commission ruling to a federal court of appeals, the Kafka-esque quality of an appeal to the body that authorized the prosecution cannot be denied.\u201d).[\/footnote] forum selection guidelines could improve confidence in the regulated community.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Encourage Dialogue Regarding the Proper Role of SEC Internal Enforcement.<\/em> \u2014 Promulgation of detailed forum selection guidelines would provide the opportunity for all interested parties\u2014the SEC, Con\u00adgress, regulated actors, and so on\u2014to constructively debate a baseline forum allocation.[footnote]Henning, Rocket Docket, supra note 112 (\u201cRequiring the S.E.C. to provide\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. some guidance about what drives a case to a particular forum would help potential defendants understand what they are up against\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Guidelines would impose a measure of accountability on the S.E.C. to explain how it will treat violations in a fair and consistent manner.\u201d).\r\nWhile this Note does not take a position as to the proper allocation of actions vis-\u00e0-vis in-house and federal court proceedings, several commentators have offered tenable proposals. Professor Joseph Grundfest has argued for an arrangement in which the federal courts act as \u201ctraffic cop[s],\u201d determining whether various actions are properly suited to an administrative or federal forum, dividing administrative actions into three categories: \u201cThe first category would include all cases statutorily required to be litigated in the admin\u00adistrative forum as well as all cases for which administrative proceedings are appropriate because of the nature of the question presented and the SEC\u2019s specialized expertise,\u201d \u201ca second category would be composed of cases that must be heard in federal court and that may not be brought in administrative proceedings except with defendants\u2019 consent\u201d (for example, those actions calling for remedies not available in administrative proceedings), and \u201c[t]he third category would be composed of cases that fall in neither of these two categories. In these residual cases, if the Commission decides to bring an administrative action, then the respondent would be permitted to petition a federal district court for removal at the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d Grundfest, Fair or Foul, supra note 16, at 1154\u201355.[\/footnote] In light of the uncontested differences in procedural mechanisms available in federal court versus an ALJ proceeding[footnote]U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Examining U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement: Recommendations on Current Processes and Practices 3 (2015), http:\/\/www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/021882_SEC_\r\nReform_FIN1.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6K86-Y259] (\u201cWhile the types of actions and the remedies [available] are similar, the two forums have substantial differences in process. These differences can have a significant impact on the procedural rights of a defendant\/respondent and, ultimately, on the respondent\u2019s ability to obtain a full, fair, and impartial adjudication.\u201d).[\/footnote] (and bracketing, for a moment, claims that SEC ALJs are far more likely than Article III judges to return a guilty verdict), it is crucial for both the SEC and regulated parties to consider how to best differentiate the types of cases properly heard in front of an Article III judge versus an ALJ.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, the \u201cdebate\u201d regarding the propriety of expanded SEC jurisdiction and discretion has already begun, but without the essen\u00adtial component of guidelines to evaluate. For example, several have argued that allowing the SEC to continuously widen its enforcement scope will undercut the SEC\u2019s mission by limiting federal courts from develop\u00ading the law and effectively insulating SEC decisionmaking from meaningful checks.[footnote]Rakoff, supra note 1, at 12 (\u201cI would urge the S.E.C. to consider that it is neither in its own long-term interest, nor in the interest of the securities markets, nor in the interest of the public as a whole, for the S.E.C. to become, in effect, a law [unto] itself.\u201d). Note also that several have argued that forum selection ambiguity has also led to \u201cunder-criminalization.\u201d See, e.g., Eithan Y. Kidron, Systemic Forum Selection Ambiguity in Financial Regulation Enforcement, 53 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 693, 694 (2016). But see Gillian E. Metzger, Administrative Constitutionalism, 91 Tex. L. Rev. 1897, 1900\u201302 (2013) (defending \u201cadministrative constitu\u00adtionalism,\u201d that is, the \u201celaboration of new constitutional understandings by administrative actors\u201d).[\/footnote] Others, perhaps most prominently Professor David Zaring, argue that the complete discretion of the SEC to prosecute where it chooses is an essential component of its ability to enforce effectively.[footnote]Zaring, Enforcement Discretion, supra note 27, at 1159. For a direct response to Zaring\u2019s argument, see generally Gideon Mark, Response, SEC Enforcement Discretion, 94 Tex. L. Rev. See Also 261 (2016), http:\/\/texaslawreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/\r\nMark-94-SeeAlso.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/AU92-2TD4].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn either case, having clear forum selection guidelines offers an opportunity for parties to propose, without excessive speculation absent guidelines, ways to limit what many deem \u201cunacceptable systematic ambiguity.\u201d[footnote]Kidron, supra note 195, at 696. Moreover, it is important to note, however briefly, that Congress could inject a great deal of clarity via some type of federal overlay constraining the SEC or at the very least channeling the SEC\u2019s use of ALJs in a fashion that is more predictable to the industry. As the dissent in <em>Tilton <\/em>pointed out, the entire purpose of the <em>Thunder Basin<\/em> framework is to determine Congress\u2019s intent. Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 296 (2d Cir. 2016) (Droney, J., dissenting). As such, Congress would be within its Article I powers to clearly provide an answer on jurisdictional preclusion in this context.[\/footnote] Moreover, to the extent outlining forum selection guidelines mitigates the outrage of the regulated community, this solution might help anticipate and prevent the industry agitating for a destabilizing overreaction to the SEC\u2019s aggressive enforcement tactics.[footnote]Consider a recent proposal by Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, which would \u201ceffectively gut the use of [SEC] in-house courts for cases.\u201d Peter J. Henning, S.E.C. Victories Delay Challenge on In-House Judges, N.Y. Times: DealBook (July 5, 2016) http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/06\/\r\nbusiness\/dealbook\/sec-victories-delay-challenge-on-in-house-judges.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). For Representative Hensarling\u2019s proposal, see H.R. 5983, 114th Cong. (2016), http:\/\/financialservices.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/choice_act-_discussion_\r\ndraft.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6CA6-9YJG].[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. <em>Duka<\/em>, Meaningful Judicial Review, and Injunction Analysis<\/h3>\r\nWhile forum selection guidelines\u2014both their creation and improvement\u2014have been proposed in other contexts,[footnote]See, e.g., Thomas A. Hanusik et al., What\u2019s Missing from the SEC\u2019s Forum Selection Guidance, Law360 (May 21, 2015), http:\/\/www.law360.com\/articles\/658532\/what-s-missing-from-the-sec-s-forum-selection-guidance (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (critiquing the SEC\u2019s 2015 public statement on forum selection).[\/footnote] doctrinal pro\u00adposals are far less frequent. Recall that in <em>Tilton<\/em>, the Second Circuit was faced with a district court split on this question of subject matter juris\u00addiction.[footnote]See <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d at 280 (\u201cWhile the district court heard argument and deliberated, several other federal judges reached conflicting decisions on the same jurisdictional issue, creating a split both within and outside the Southern District.\u201d); supra section II.B.1.[\/footnote] The court chose to affirm Judge Abrams\u2019s analysis in the trial court, thereby refusing to exercise subject matter jurisdiction, and in doing so rejected Judge Berman\u2019s alternative approach in <em>Duka v. SEC<\/em>, which involved the use of standard injunction analysis to review the con\u00adstitutional challenges. This Note argues that future courts hearing chal\u00adlenges akin to <em>Tilton <\/em>should apply the framework employed most explicitly in <em>Duka<\/em>, which allows aggrieved parties the opportunity for meaningful judicial review of constitutional claims in an Article III court while enabling the Article III court to quickly return the case to the SEC ALJ if the constitutional challenge appears unlikely to succeed on the merits.\r\n\r\n<em>Duka<\/em> involved a paradigmatic case as far as this Note is concerned: The SEC initiated an internal enforcement action against Barbara Duka for alleged violations of section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Duka countered by filing an injunction in the Southern District of New York, claiming that ALJs are unconstitutionally insulated from presidential oversight in violation of Article II of the Constitution.[footnote]Duka v. SEC, 103 F. Supp. 3d 382, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), abrogated by <em>Tilton<\/em>, 824 F.3d 276.[\/footnote] Judge Berman held that (1) the court had subject matter jurisdiction over Duka\u2019s consti\u00adtutional claims, <em>but<\/em> (2) the preliminary injunction ought to be denied on grounds that the court deemed Duka unlikely to succeed on the merits.[footnote]Id. at 385\u201386.[\/footnote] <em>Duka<\/em> thus provided both <em>meaningful <\/em>judicial review while avoiding the trap of entertaining (what the court deemed) a meritless challenge.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Putting the \u201cMeaningful\u201d Back in Meaningful Judicial Review.<\/em> \u2014 <em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s willingness to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the consti\u00adtutional claim intimated the Court\u2019s sensitivity to the frustration of defendants who feel that the inability to bring challenges in district court has unfairly stacked the deck in the SEC\u2019s favor.[footnote]In a telling maneuver, Judge Berman framed the opinion with a quotation from New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350 (1989), on the right of parties to choose federal court when jurisdiction is proper: \u201cWhen a Federal court is properly appealed to in a case over which it has by law jurisdiction, it is its duty to take such jurisdiction.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The right of a party plaintiff to choose a Federal court where there is a choice cannot be properly denied.\u201d <em>Duka<\/em>, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 385 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc.<\/em>, 491 U.S. at 358\u201359).[\/footnote] The <em>Duka <\/em>court took the position that \u201ceventual\u201d judicial review of a constitutional challenge to an administrative proceeding cannot in any real sense be <em>meaningful <\/em>if the challenge is relegated to the aftermath of the administrative action, indicating that money spent on litigation and reputational costs were worthy of consideration.[footnote]<em>Duka<\/em>, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 390.[\/footnote] That is to say, regardless of outcome, <em>Duka<\/em> framed the decision to clearly signal that the court took the constitu\u00adtional challenge seriously, as opposed to simply a defense mechanism to the SEC enforcement.[footnote]<em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s posture in this regard, that is, conveying sensitivity to the plight of a party faced with potential harsh sanctions, is arguably not without precedent in the history of federal equity. Indeed, under the <em>Ex parte Young<\/em> lineage, even with <em>Armstrong<\/em>\u2019s more recent gloss, private parties have long had the right to seek injunctions of purportedly unconstitutional actions by federal officers. See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1383\u201384 (2015); Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155\u201356 (1908). This remedial right has recently been characterized by the Court as the \u201ccreation of courts of equity,\u201d capable of displacement by express congressional action, but otherwise malleable by federal courts in the pursuit of equitable outcomes. <em>Armstrong<\/em>, 135 S. Ct. at 1384. As such, it is not out of the question to suggest that federal courts could formally fashion an injunctive remedy similar to the <em>Duka<\/em> approach to handle constitutional challenges to the SEC.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne possible objection to <em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s threshold consideration of the merits of the constitutional challenge would be to argue that this approach wastefully imposes costs on the SEC Enforcement Division, which must convince an Article III court to dismiss a constitutional challenge before proceeding with the administrative action. This may very well be true, but this argument ignores the possibility that the ire of the regulated community may, via lobbying or otherwise, encourage an overly heavy-handed legislative response that causes far more disruption to the SEC enforcement regime than the <em>Duka<\/em> approach.\r\n\r\nThis possibility is far from insubstantial\u2014in April of 2017, Congressman Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) introduced H.R. 2128, the Due Process Restoration Act, which proposes to \u201cprovide respondents in SEC enforcement cases with the option to have their proceedings advance in a federal district court instead of internal SEC administrative courts.\u201d[footnote]Press Release, U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson, Rep. Davidson Introduces the Due Process Restoration Act of 2017 (Apr. 26, 2017), http:\/\/davidson.house.gov\/media-center\/press-releases\/rep-davidson-introduces-due-process-restoration-act-2017 [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/G84Y-YDXT] [hereinafter Davidson Press Release]. Other similarly drastic, at least relative to the status quo, legislative proposals have also been introduced. See H. Comm. on Fin. Servs., The Financial Choice Act: Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers, and Entrepreneurs 96\u2013101 (2016), http:\/\/financialservices.house.gov\/\r\nuploadedfiles\/financial_choice_act_comprehensive_outline.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/H6EA-LN5B] (proposing to (1) allow defendants in SEC enforcement actions to remove at-will to federal district court and (2) eliminate judicial deference to ALJ findings).[\/footnote] Congressman Davidson\u2019s proposal, currently pending before the House Financial Services Committee, declines <em>Duka<\/em>\u2019s relatively middle-ground approach and instead would allow <em>all<\/em> defendants to simply opt out of administra\u00adtive enforcement.[footnote]Davidson Press Release, supra note 206. For a strong criticism of this proposal, see, e.g., David Zaring, The Due Process Restoration Act of 2015 Would Kill Administrative Adjudication at the SEC, Conglomerate (Nov. 3, 2015), http:\/\/www.theconglomerate.org\/\r\n2015\/11\/the-dueprocess-restoration-act-of-2015-would-kill-administrative-adjudication-at-the-secnd-.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/NN7M-GA7A].[\/footnote] Article III courts, as well as all believers in the merits of administrative adjudication, therefore have good reason to adopt a compromise approach of the <em>Duka<\/em> ilk rather than await current industry antipathy to manifest itself in an incautious rollback of SEC enforcement capabilities.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Granting Injunctions (or Not) Using Standard Injunction Analysis.<\/em> \u2014 The key decisional element that this Note argues makes <em>Duka<\/em> the desira\u00adble framework is the <em>second<\/em> step of the analysis, that is, considering the success of the constitutional challenge on the merits. By employing standard injunction analysis[footnote]<em>Duka<\/em>, 103 F. Supp. 3d at 392.[\/footnote]\u2014asking whether \u201cPlaintiff (1) is likely to succeed on the merits of her claim, (2) will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, and (3) the public interest weighs in favor of granting the injunction\u201d\u2014<em>Duka\u2019<\/em>s approach catalyzes several positive effects: First, entertaining subject matter jurisdiction and <em>then<\/em> reviewing likelihood of success on the merits allows defendants to receive a hearing in federal court without having to navigate the serpentine internal pro\u00adcesses of the SEC, with the very likely possibility of the parties settling during the interim.[footnote]See supra note 52.[\/footnote] Second, as was the case in <em>Duka<\/em>, the second step of injunction analysis, which includes review of the likelihood of success on the merits, will weed out frivolous constitutional challenges, thereby encouraging defendants ex ante to carefully consider whether to raise a constitutional challenge at all.\r\n\r\nConcern that allowing district courts to exercise subject matter jurisdiction allows wealthy defendants to deflect meritorious SEC prose\u00adcutions is not unreasonable. However, this Note takes the position that this concern is misguided. As Judge Rakoff explained in another recent case:\r\n<blockquote>To be sure, it would not be prudent to allow every subject of an SEC enforcement action who alleges \u201cbad faith\u201d and \u201cselective prosecution\u201d to be able to create a diversion by bringing a parallel action in federal district court. But such diversionary tactics can be quickly disposed of in the ordinary case through dismissal for failure to plead a plausible claim.[footnote]Gupta v. SEC, 796 F. Supp. 2d 503, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Judge Rakoff went on to explain, \u201cA fear of abuse by litigants in other cases should never deter a federal court from its unfailing duty to provide a forum for vindication of constitutional protections to those who can make a substantial showing that they have indeed been denied their rights.\u201d Id.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nMoreover, it is certainly not inconceivable that the SEC, emboldened by the current hands-off approach of the circuits addressing the issue, could become even more aggressive about prosecuting in-house and in so doing, cross the line into the unconstitutional, thus calling for more aggressive prophylactic measures.[footnote]In the case of this eventuality, \u201cinjunctive relief has long been recognized as <em>the proper means for preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally<\/em>,\u201d and <em>Duka<\/em> would align with this intuition. Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001) (emphasis added).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n3. <em>The Cost of<\/em> Duka<em>.<\/em> \u2014 Implementing injunction analysis in keeping with <em>Duka<\/em> would not be without cost. Dodd-Frank, the spark behind the recent backlash toward SEC behavior, was enacted with the purpose of tightening regulation on the financial industry in the aftermath of one the worst financial crises the United States has experienced since the Great Depression.[footnote]Remarks by the President at Signing of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, White House Office of the Press Sec\u2019y (July 21, 2010), http:\/\/obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\/the-press-office\/remarks-president-signing-dodd-frank-wall-street-reform-and-consumer-protection-act [http:\/\/perma.cc\/24JU-YMBU] (\u201cOver the past two years, we have faced the worst recession since the Great Depression. Eight million people lost their jobs. Tens of millions saw the value of their homes and retirement savings plummet.\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, one could argue with little difficulty that Dodd-Frank was passed with the express purpose of placing a thumb on the scale in favor of entities like the SEC.[footnote]Id. (\u201c[T]hese reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history.\u201d).[\/footnote] Were Article III courts to adopt the approach in <em>Duka<\/em> and exercise subject matter jurisdiction, even cursorily to determine feasibility of a claim before returning the matter to the SEC, this would no doubt interrupt the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions, imposing costs on the SEC resulting from having to halt the in-house action and litigate in an Article III court before potentially return\u00ading in-house.[footnote]But see <em>Gupta<\/em>, 796 F. Supp. 2d at 514 (\u201cA fear of abuse by litigants in other cases should never deter a federal court from its unfailing duty to provide a forum for vindication of constitutional protections.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nStill, the countervailing costs may be even more troubling. In dis\u00admissing Tilton\u2019s claims, the Second Circuit noted: \u201cThe litigant\u2019s financial and emotional costs in litigating the initial proceeding are <em>simply the price of participating in the American legal system<\/em>.\u201d[footnote]Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 285 (2d Cir. 2016) (emphasis added).[\/footnote] On this view, the require\u00adment to endure an SEC in-house administrative action prior to reaching an Article III court acts as a kind of tax on such challenges. This cost is compounded, as already argued, by the reputational damage, litigation expense, and risk (particularly for public companies) entailed by seeing an action through the many layers of SEC review before reach\u00ading a court of appeals. These costs, in turn, strongly incentivize settlement prior to Article III adjudication.[footnote]See supra note 52 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] If this is an accurate picture, challenges based in constitutional and administrative law may <em>never<\/em> reach an Article III hearing, threatening to stunt the growth of both areas of law with respect to the administrative state at a time when the administrative state is heavily relied upon.[footnote]For an illustration of the SEC\u2019s potential to prevent Article III courts from developing federal securities law, see John P. Flannery and James D. Hopkins, Securities Act Release No. 9689, Exchange Act Release No. 73840, Advisers Act Release No. 3981, Investment Company Act Release No. 31374, at 12 (Dec. 15, 2014), http:\/\/www.sec.gov\/litigation\/opinions\/2014\/33-9689.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/87YY-S6RQ] (providing the SEC\u2019s own interpretation of the statute at issue to resolve \u201cinconsistencies,\u201d as characterized by the SEC, in federal district court).[\/footnote] Just as it may be exces\u00adsively dire to suggest that the entire SEC apparatus is unconstitutional, it may be too dismissive to suggest that the SEC, given sufficient insulation from Article III court review, will not be tempted to push the envelope into the realm of unconstitutional behavior.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nThe post-Dodd-Frank SEC operates in a climate that simultaneously demands rigorous regulation of financial actors and is character\u00adized by widespread attacks, both meritorious and otherwise, on the adminis\u00adtrative state itself. As such, it has become increasingly important for the SEC to clearly articulate a reasoned and diligent enforcement strategy while maintaining its legitimacy as a fair and apolitical body. The increased enforcement capabilities of the SEC combined with the move to pro\u00adsecute more frequently in-house has generated a mutual antipathy that undermines the legitimacy of the SEC and has materialized in chal\u00adlenges to the SEC that could destabilize the Commission.\r\n\r\nThis climate has only been exacerbated by the refusal of Article III courts to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional chal\u00adlenges to the nature of SEC administrative proceedings and the failure of the SEC to articulate clear forum selection guidelines.\r\n\r\nAllowing Article III courts to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to the SEC\u2019s in-house proceedings\u2014whether achieved doctrinally via <em>Thunder Basin <\/em>or legislatively through forum selection guidelines\u2014has the potential to reduce the temperature of the controversy surrounding SEC in-house proceedings, bolster the SEC\u2019s legitimacy as an enforcement body, and ensure that Article III courts remain independently capable of developing administrative and constitutional law.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

While the 2016 election has heightened these concerns, the fact is that for over a decade those who follow politics closely have been sounding alarm bells about the myriad ways the party system in the United States is failing to live up to its intended democratic function. Some have been preoccupied with ideo\u00adlogical polarization and legislative gridlock,[footnote]See, e.g., Richard H. Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, Political Fragmentation, and the Decline of American Government, 124 Yale L.J. 804, 809 (2014) [hereinafter Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy]; Richard H. Pildes, Why the Center Does Not Hold: The Causes of Hyperpolarized Democracy in America, 99 Calif. L. Rev. 273, 276\u201381 (2011) [hereinafter Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold].[\/footnote] others with the apparent disconnect between the policies pursued and the preferences of the constituencies represented,[footnote]See, e.g., Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, 57 B.C.

Known in the literature as \u201crespon\u00adsible party government,\u201d the theory, which, as it happens, also accounts for the specifics of the recent calls for party reform, presumes that electoral accountability emerges from the choice between ideologically distinct political parties during competitive elections.[footnote]For an explanation of responsible party government and a comparison to promi\u00adnent theories of political parties, see John H. Aldrich, Why Parties? A Second Look 8\u201316 (2011).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nResponsible party government theory underpins the Court\u2019s juris\u00adprudence on the First Amendment rights of political parties. It is responsible party government that explains not only why current constitutional doctrine entrenches the two-party system but also why it invariably sides with the leaders of the two major parties when internal disputes arise.[footnote]See infra notes 65\u201379 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Accordingly, whatever the precise ruling might have been in <em>Republican Party of Louisiana v. FEC<\/em>, one thing was virtually certain: The Court\u2019s reasoning would have taken place within the confines of this particular account of how to harness the imperfect incentives of political parties to produce democratic accountability. Thus, its recent decisions not to take up important cases involving the First Amendment rights of political parties provide an opportunity to revisit the commitment to responsible party government and, potentially, to head off any efforts to constitutionalize a party-reform agenda that appears doomed to fail.\r\n\r\nThe commitment to responsible party government in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, and also among party reformers, is a colossal mistake. Responsible party government has not panned out. The political parties are stronger and more ideologically distinct than in any prior era.[footnote]See Pew Research Ctr., Political Polarization in the American Public 6 (2014), http:\/\/www.people-press.org\/2014\/06\/12\/political-polarization-in-the-american-public\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/ML83-37QW] (\u201cRepublicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines\u2014and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive\u2014than at any point in the last two decades.\u201d).

Indeed, as one promi\u00adnent political scientist has concluded, \u201c[t]he scope for independent action by elected leaders\u201d is especially great today, with the \u201cpaucity of elite responsiveness to public opinion extend[ing] even to issues on which public opinion seems to be unusually firm and stable.\u201d[footnote]Larry M. Bartels, Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age 287 (1st ed. 2008); see also Stephen Ansolabehere et al., Candidate Positioning in U.S. House Elections, 45 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 136, 152\u201354 (2001) (arguing that it is the utility to incumbents of ideological coherence within the party that accounts for this pattern).[\/footnote] To the extent there is accountability today, it is almost entirely to party donors and ideological groups.[footnote]Cf. Mann &amp; Corrado, supra note 4, at 1 (highlighting the effects of increased involvement of \u201c[i]deologically-based outside groups financed by wealthy donors\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhereas the debate in legal-academic and policy circles has been driven by fidelity to responsible party government despite its well-documented failures, this Essay argues that it is time to admit that responsible party government has run its course as a means for achieving democratic accountability and, therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s political party jurisprudence is in desperate need of a theoretical overhaul. Respon\u00adsible party government is premised on the existence of competi\u00adtive elections that provide each party with an incentive to mobilize the electorate and, accordingly, address the interests of the median voter.[footnote]See Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 308 (\u201cIf general elections were competitive, winning candidates would, in theory, have to be responsive to the median voter in the general election.\u201d).[\/footnote] We, however, live in a world of increasingly uncompetitive elections, and there is no reason to expect that to change anytime soon.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7 (noting that in recent cycles only about one out of twenty House elections were competitive\u2014defined as a margin of victory of less than 5%\u2014and that the numbers are only marginally better for the Senate); see also Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 309\u201310 (discussing the decline of competitive elections).[\/footnote] For one, although the Supreme Court has shown fidelity to the need for strong parties, it has been singularly unreceptive to adopting a procompetition theory of the First Amendment that would ensure the requisite condi\u00adtions for competitive elections.[footnote]The architects of this approach are Samuel Issacharoff and Richard H. Pildes. See generally Samuel Issacharoff &amp; Richard H. Pildes, Politics as Markets: Partisan Lockups of the Democratic Process, 50 Stan. L. Rev. 643 (1998). Although many continue to pin their hopes on a change of heart, to date, the Court has yet to take the bait. See Benisek v. Lamone, 266 F. Supp. 3d 799 (D. Md. 2017), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 543 (2017); Whitford v. Gill, 218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (W.D. Wis. 2016), argued, Transcript of Oral Argument, No. 16-1161 (U.S. Oct. 3, 2017).[\/footnote] Thus, absent mechanisms for direct democratic reform, increasing party competition would depend on legis\u00adlatures acting against their self-interest. Further, there is good reason to believe that the lack of party competition in most places is substantially, and increasingly, a result of ideological geographic self-sorting rather than partisan gerrymandering.[footnote]See, e.g., Drutman, supra note 7 (noting the geographic divide in partisan identi\u00adties); Reiham Salam &amp; Rob Richie, Opinion, How to Make Congress Bipartisan, N.Y. Times (July 7, 2017), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/07\/opinion\/how-to-make-congress-bipartisan.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (\u201cToday\u2019s voters\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. are self-sorting such that the median county in the 2016 presidential race was won by more than 40 percentage points.\u201d).[\/footnote] Finally, at least for the moment, reforms aimed to shore up the party leadership\u2019s ability to control its political brand appear politically unpalatable, given the pervasive public mistrust of party insiders.[footnote]Rauch, supra note 8 (noting that \u201cthe politics of [party reform aimed at shoring up the leadership] are hard\u201d because, among other things, \u201c[t]he public is wedded to an anti-establishment narrative\u201d).[\/footnote] The bottom line is that we have no choice but to fundamentally reconceive how we might elicit responsive and responsible governance from our political parties.\r\n\r\nWithout claiming that there are easy solutions to our democratic dysfunctions, this Essay develops the contours of an alternate path to democratic responsiveness and accountability and identifies ways to incorporate it into existing First Amendment doctrine.[footnote]See infra Part III.[\/footnote] The proposed alternative path seeks to address our current crisis of responsiveness by reforming political parties <em>as associations<\/em>.[footnote]See infra Part II.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nViewed as associations, the capacity of political parties to foster a functioning democracy depends less on party leaders defining and enforcing a coherent platform and more on the depth and breadth of the party\u2019s political networks. The primary impediment to responsive governance is not weak, mealy-mouthed political parties. It is candidates and political parties that lack effective social networks and feedback loops through which the interests of ordinary Americans can be filtered up to party elites.

L. Rev. 53, 59, 87 n.164 (2014) [hereinafter Abu El-Haj, Friends, Associates, and Associations] (noting that critiques of the importance of personal ties emphasize organization, not speech or ideology, in their accounts of civic and political engagement).[\/footnote] Once we appreciate that the decision to take political action is only partly a matter of belief, enthusiasm, or ideological commitment, it is possible to see why strengthening and broadening social ties within partisan networks presents an alternative and as yet underappreciated path to responsive and responsible governance.[footnote]See infra section II.A.[\/footnote] It is also possible to see why uncontrolled deregulation of party financing is not necessarily the answer.[footnote]See infra notes 273\u2013281 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nParty theorists have largely been blind to the democratic potential arising out of the fact that parties are political networks comprised of individuals and groups with social ties to one another and the broader electorate. Conceiving of parties almost exclusively <em>as ideological speakers<\/em>, they have failed to systematically explore the part associations can play in mobilizing and informing citizens and in facilitating a two-way street of communication between party leaders and ordinary voters, let alone the ways such efforts could contribute to good governance.[footnote]See infra section II.C.2.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is important to acknowledge up front that, unlike traditional responsible party government theory, an associational-party perspective starts from the premise that \u201cAmerican political parties are not solely elite institutions selling their brand to a passive public\u201d[footnote]Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 203\u201304.[\/footnote] and seeks a thicker form of democracy in which the political participation of ordinary citizens is not confined to \u201cthe general election, with the table already set and the menu already chosen.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 204. In this regard, the associational-party perspective unapologetically rejects the notion that \u201cthe people are a sovereign that \u2018can speak only when spoken to,\u2019 and \u2018whose vocabulary is limited to two words, \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d\u2019\u201d Michael S. Kang, The Hydraulics and Politics of Party Regulation, 91 Iowa L. Rev. 131, 167 (2005) (quoting E.E. Schattschneider, Party Government 52 (Greenwood Press 1977) (1942)) [hereinafter Kang, Hydraulics].[\/footnote] But it does so without ignoring the fact that \u201c<em>somebody <\/em>is going to organize politics,\u201d and that somebody is likely to be somebody with money, who may well \u201cdemand a price.\u201d[footnote]Seth E. Masket, No Middle Ground: How Informal Party Organizations Control Nominations and Polarize Legislatures 203 (2009).[\/footnote] In this regard, the associational-party perspective offers a marriage between the pragmatic tradition, which accepts political parties for what they are\u2014associations dominated by self-interested political elites\u2014and the romantic tradition, which seeks enhanced democratic accountability through the political participation of ordinary citizens as agents rather than consumers.[footnote]Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 815\u201316 (defining the two tradi\u00adtions while denigrating the latter).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is equally important to acknowledge upfront that the associational-party path is predicated on the assumption that entrenched problems demand multifaceted interventions aimed at incremental change. The current party system is unsustainable in the long term, and reforms grounded in responsible party government are not promising. It is, therefore, critically important not only to entertain alternative theoret\u00adical foundations but also to identify corresponding opportunities to address the dysfunctions of our party system in an incremental fashion.\r\n\r\nThis Essay concentrates on the Court\u2019s First Amendment jurispru\u00addence, identifying opportunities within existing doctrine to avoid consti\u00adtutionally requiring wholesale deregulation of party finances. In so doing, it illustrates how that same doctrinal vehicle would permit courts to strategically underwrite the strength of those segments of the partisan network that enhance opportunities for social contact between party elites and the broader electorate (including with the aid of money) and thus further the goals of an associational path to responsive governance.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this Essay argues for extending the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework, which the Supreme Court developed in cases involving burdens on the right to participate in elections,[footnote]See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 782 (1983).[\/footnote] to cases implicating the associational rights of the major political parties. The <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework has the distinct virtue of requiring courts to weigh the severity of constitutional burdens <em>before<\/em> imposing strict scrutiny.[footnote]<em>Burdick<\/em>, 504 U.S. at 434 (\u201cUnder this standard, the rigorousness of our inquiry\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\u201d). Thus, under the standard, when First and Fourteenth Amendment rights are subjected to \u201csevere\u201d restrictions, the regulation must be \u201cnarrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.\u201d Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992). \u201cBut when a state election law provision imposes only \u2018reasonable, nondiscriminatory restric\u00adtions\u2019 upon\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [the] rights of voters, \u2018the State\u2019s important regulatory interests are gener\u00adally sufficient to justify\u2019 the restrictions.\u201d <em>Burdick<\/em>, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting <em>Anderson<\/em>, 460 U.S. at 788).[\/footnote] Developed to wrestle with the reality that the legitimacy of our democracy frequently depends on establishing election procedures, the test explicitly foregrounds analysis of the burdens, reserving strict scrutiny for cases in which regulatory burdens are severe.[footnote]<em>Burdick<\/em>, 504 U.S. at 433\u201334 (recounting that only those regulations severely restricting voting \u201cmust be \u2018narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance\u2019\u201d because to operate otherwise \u201cwould tie the hands of States seeking to assure that elections are operated equitably and efficiently\u201d insofar as \u201c[e]lection laws will invariably impose some burden[s]\u201d (quoting <em>Norman<\/em>, 502 U.S. at 289)).[\/footnote] Because it is already sensitive to determining which burdens are of constitutional dimension, it provides a suitable vehicle for integrating the associational-party path into existing doctrine. As such, the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> frame\u00adwork is also well positioned to attend to the longstanding goal of the Court\u2019s political party cases\u2014ensuring responsible governance.\r\n\r\nThe associational-party perspective, however, requires two modifica\u00adtions to current doctrine. First, the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework would be extended to all contexts implicating the right to associate, including those involving the two major political parties. Second, and more import\u00adantly, the associational-party perspective demands a new scale with which to weigh and differentiate the burdens on a party\u2019s First Amendment rights. In the typical <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> case, courts balance the character and magnitude of the alleged burden on voting against state interests.[footnote]See, e.g., Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 190, 202\u201303 (2008) (applying the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework and determining that requiring voters to provide a photo identification did not, in principle, impose a severe burden on the right to vote).[\/footnote] In the party context, in weighing the severity of constitutional burdens, the focus would shift to assessing the regulatory impact on a party\u2019s capacity to mobilize broad and representative political participation and facilitate a two-way street of information transmission through party activists. It would, thereby, ensure that First Amendment rights are allo\u00adcated in ways that are more, rather than less, likely to encourage political parties and their candidates to heed the concerns of their constituents.\r\n\r\nThe principal mistake of the Court\u2019s doctrine has been its singular preoccupation with protecting political parties, as speakers, from bur\u00addens placed on their brand.[footnote]Cf. McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 352 (2003) (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (explaining that \u201cthe national political parties are exemplars of political speech,\u201d \u201cpro\u00admot[ing] coordinated political messages\u201d and existing often \u201cprimarily for the purpose of expressing ideas and generating debate\u201d), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] The latter modification provides a way to redirect the doctrinal focus from shoring up party elites and their ability to define and control a distinct political brand. Instead, courts would allocate First Amendment rights in ways that prevent regulation from undermining the socioeconomic and intergenerational breadth or the interpersonal depth of partisan networks.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, this doctrinal proposal is not entirely a professor\u00adial pipe dream. The Supreme Court\u2019s political party jurisprudence is ripe for reform. First, it is already structured around the idea that First Amendment rights must be allocated to facilitate democratic account\u00adability.[footnote]See infra section I.A.[\/footnote] As such, it provides a relatively easy point of entry. Further, the extension of the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework would merely rationalize the doctrine. Second, a growing consensus has emerged that our political party system needs fundamental reform if responsible and responsive governance is to emerge.[footnote]See supra notes 4, 7\u20139 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Thus, there is a good deal of political will, possibly even among the Justices in light of the Court\u2019s recent decisions, for change.\r\n\r\nPart I of this Essay begins by recounting the origins of responsible party government and explaining the ways it underpins the Court\u2019s entire party jurisprudence. Part I\u2019s central contribution, however, is the evidence it provides of the growing consensus that responsible party government has given way to irresponsible party governance. In doing so, it sets up the central argument of this Essay: that we have no choice but to consider alternative paths to responsive and accountable governance. Part II proceeds to make the case that an alternate path to democratic responsiveness and accountability emerges when one focuses on political parties <em>as associations<\/em>. It reviews the empirical evidence supporting the importance of social ties to political mobilization, organization, and information transmission as well as the implications of recent changes to the associational qualities of partisan networks. Finally, Part III identifies opportunities within existing First Amendment doctrine to sustain and build partisan networks more capable of producing democratic respon\u00adsiveness and accountability. Integrating an associational-party perspective into existing First Amendment doctrine is obviously only a first step. The fact, however, that there are no simple fixes to the ills of our party system should not diminish the value of incremental change.\r\n<h2>I. From Responsible Party Government to Irresponsible Party Governance<\/h2>\r\nResponsible party government theory underpins both the Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the First Amendment rights of political parties and the particulars of recent calls to reform our party system. This Part first recounts the origins and specifics of the theory of responsible party government, and how this theory is reflected in the case law. It then sets out the evidence demonstrating that the theory of responsible party government has not panned out as expected.\r\n<h3>A. Responsible Party Government and the First Amendment Rights of Political Parties<\/h3>\r\nNotwithstanding the Founding Fathers\u2019 opposition to political parties as quintessential factions, the Supreme Court has consistently afforded political parties robust First Amendment rights given their critical part in \u201cthe transformation of the voters\u2019 will into a government that reflects that will.\u201d[footnote]Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 357 (2004) (Breyer, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] In fact, the Court has consciously allocated First Amendment rights in ways believed to encourage broader democratic goals, including participation and accountability.[footnote]See Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 138 (identifying and criticizing courts and commentators for their unrelenting efforts to devise regulatory proposals and judicial doctrines that encourage political parties \u201cto promote democratic values like political participation, an informed electorate, and\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. democratic responsiveness\u201d).[\/footnote] Unfortunately, it is attached to a theory of how to harness parties\u2019 self-interest to democratic ends that\u2014whatever its original merits\u2014has not panned out as anticipated.\r\n\r\nParties are a puzzle for democracies. On the one hand, representa\u00adtive government in the modern nation state is unimaginable without a party system to organize voters, candidates, and legislators.[footnote]Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 574 (2000) (\u201cRepresentative democ\u00adracy in any populous unit of governance is unimaginable without the ability of citizens to band together in promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse their political views.\u201d); see also Aldrich, supra note 18, at 3\u201364 (explaining that without party identifica\u00adtions, voters would not be able to hold individual elected officials accountable for acts of government and elected officials would not be able to muster a record on which to be judged).[\/footnote] As Jonathan Rauch colorfully puts this point: \u201cIf the Constitution [is] the system\u2019s DNA, the parties\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [are] its RNA, translating the Founders\u2019 bare-bones framework\u201d into a working government.[footnote]Rauch, supra note 8.[\/footnote] On the other hand, \u201cparties are no great friends of popular sovereignty.\u201d[footnote]Kathleen Bawn et al., A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics, 10 Persp. on Pol. 571, 572 (2012).[\/footnote] In the business of reelec\u00adtion, their <em>preferred <\/em>mode of operation is to persuade voters to accept their preexisting agendas; only infrequently and reluctantly, and often in the face of defeat, do political parties modify their platforms to reflect the preferences of their members.[footnote]Id. (noting that political parties seek to \u201ccede as little policy to voters as possi\u00adble\u201d); see also Martin Gilens, Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America 163 (2012) (concluding that data reveals \u201cparties behave more like pol\u00adicy maximizers than vote maximizers, responding to the preferences of the public (and disproportionately to the most affluent segment of the public) when necessary but pursu\u00ading their own policy agendas when they can\u201d).[\/footnote] Their traditional manifestation is the \u201cmachine[]\u201d and its somewhat unseemly \u201cpowerbrokers.\u201d[footnote]Rauch, supra note 8 (noting further that \u201c[p]arties, machines, and hacks may not have been pretty, but at their best they did their job so well the country forgot why it needed them\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis tension between the <em>realpolitik<\/em> of political parties and the constitutional aspiration of self-governance gives rise to a central preoccu\u00adpation among scholars of American democracy: Given their primary interest in aggrandizing power, how can political parties and the candidates they field be induced to govern responsively?\r\n\r\nEnter responsible party government theory. In the 1950s, a group of prominent political scientists, under the auspices of the American Political Science Association (APSA), theorized a resolution to the paradoxical role parties play in modern democracies\u2014a resolution that has dominated the field of political science since its inception. Known in the literature as responsible party government, it posited that the key to achieving democratic accountability is to provide the electorate a clear choice between candidates representing distinct political parties on election day.[footnote]Am. Political Sci. Ass\u2019n, Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System: A Report of the Committee on Political Parties of the American Political Science Association, 44 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 1, 15 (1950) [hereinafter APSA Report].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUnderlying the theory was a market metaphor: Political parties should be conceptualized as the producers of a product (candidates and platforms) that voters consume.[footnote]Nancy L. Rosenblum, Primus Inter Pares: Political Parties and Civil Society, 75 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 493, 496 (2000) [hereinafter Rosenblum, Primus Inter Pares] (explain\u00ading that mainstream political science views \u201celectoral parties as cadres of candidates, professional organizers, and hired consultants, and of citizens as consumers of their prod\u00aducts\u201d); see also Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 201 &amp; n.94 (noting the marketplace metaphor was brought into the legal literature by the work of Samuel Issacharoff and Richard H. Pildes).[\/footnote] Just as consumers\u2019 interests are served by competition among producers to make appealing products, the electorate\u2019s interests are served by competition between parties to produce an appealing political brand\u2014one that voters \u201cpurchase\u201d on election day. The basic theory is nicely summarized by Justice Breyer in his dissent in <em>Vieth v. Jubelirer<\/em>:\r\n<blockquote>[P]olitical parties play a necessary role in [transforming the will of the majority into effective government]. At a minimum, they help voters assign responsibility for current circumstances, thereby enabling those voters, through their votes for individual candidates, to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the political status quo. Those voters can either vote to support that status quo or vote to \u201cthrow the rascals out.\u201d A party-based political system that satisfies this minimal condition encourages democratic responsibility. It facilitates the transformation of the voters\u2019 will into a government that reflects that will.[footnote]541 U.S. 267, 356\u201357 (2004) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citations omitted); see also Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 531 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting) (\u201cVoters with little infor\u00admation about individuals seeking office traditionally have relied upon party affiliation as a guide to choosing among candidates.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe theory\u2019s principal payoff was that it appeared to offer a cheap solution to the persistent problem ignorant voters pose for democratic accountability. Faced with the limited capacity of individual citizens to monitor elected officials, responsible party government theory side\u00adstepped the difficult task of producing an informed electorate. Instead, it sought to create a mechanism by which accountability to the electorate would be achieved indirectly through a strong two-party system in which ideologically distinct political parties competed for votes on election day. Critical to the success of the system was to empower party leaders to produce brands that would offer ignorant political consumers significant information about candidates at low cost, thereby \u201c\u2018reducing the transaction costs\u2019 of democracy.\u201d[footnote]Rosenblum, Primus Inter Pares, supra note 55, at 497.[\/footnote] Professor Michael McConnell summarizes the basic hypothesis well:\r\n<blockquote>To be sure, ideological labels are crude and one-dimensional, but they provide more accurate signals for the rationally igno\u00adrant voter than the old party labels, under which a \u201cDemocrat\u201d might be far more conservative than his \u201cRepublican\u201d opponent\u00a0. . . . Ideologically coherent party identification can be seen as a form of \u201ctruth in labeling\u201d: the voter knows what he or she is getting. Voters then have a clearer choice between directions for the country, which enables them to force a shift in policy.[footnote]Michael W. McConnell, Moderation and Coherence in American Democracy, 99 Calif. L. Rev. 373, 379 (2011); see also John H. Aldrich &amp; John D. Griffin, Parties, Elections, and Democratic Politics, <em>in<\/em> Oxford Handbook of American Elections and Political Behavior 595, 598\u2013606 (Jan E. Leighley ed., 2010).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nResponsible party government, in other words, took political parties as they were, while promising to harness the self-interest of these elite organizations toward \u201csmall-d\u201d democratic ends.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, legal reforms were necessary. The APSA Report recommended a series of reforms aimed to balance party discipline and voice.[footnote]See APSA Report, supra note 54, at 67 (emphasizing two-way communication between the national party council and its members); see also id. at 22, 65\u201367 (addressing efforts to increase voice and membership).[\/footnote] Reforms to the nomination process, in particular, took a central place. The closed primary was the key to the entire initiative. It would provide party members a voice, thereby reducing intraparty conflicts.[footnote]Id. at 10.[\/footnote] The APSA Report hypothesized that increasing the say of party members with respect to both candidates and platforms by adopting a direct primary would improve buy-in to a national platform from the party faithful.[footnote]Id. at 66\u201367 (arguing that \u201cgeneral and wholehearted support of the party pro\u00adgram\u201d would follow from the reorganization of the party \u201con democratic lines\u201d and that \u201ccohesion [would] spring[] naturally from willingness to support aims which the member himself has helped to shape and has come to accept\u201d).[\/footnote] At the same time, limiting participation in the primary to party members would provide an opportunity to produce more ideologically distinct candidates and platforms. Candidates and elected officials selected by a more coherent party base would be more capable of holding a party line, especially if party leaders maintained informal control over the selection of primary contenders.[footnote]Id. at 10, 66, 72 (observing \u201c[u]nity among leaders\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is difficult if they speak for members with entirely different objectives and fundamentally different ideas on public policy\u201d and noting \u201c[t]he formal or informal proposal of candidates by preprimary meet\u00adings of responsible party committees or party councils is a healthy development\u201d).[\/footnote] The APSA Report\u2019s analysis of the various alternative nominating processes makes clear its thinking:\r\n<blockquote>The direct primary probably can be adapted to the needs of parties unified in terms of national policy. <em>The closed primary deserves preference<\/em> because it is more readily compatible with the development of a responsible party system. <em>The open primary tends to destroy the concept of membership<\/em> as the basis of party organization. <em>Cross filing is bound to obscure program differences between the parties<\/em>, and to eliminate any sense of real membership on the part of the rank and file. The Washington <em>blanket primary corrupts the meaning of party even further by permitting voters at the same primary to roam at will among the parties<\/em>.[footnote]Id. at 10 (emphasis added). A blanket primary is one in which voters are pre\u00adsented with a single ballot, listing all the contenders, and are able to switch party primaries from office to office. See generally Alexander R. Podkul &amp; Elaine Kamarck, The Primaries Project: Blanket Primaries Have Yet to Deliver, Brookings Inst.

The Court\u2019s commitment to responsible party government\u2019s account of the path to democratic accountability explains both why the Court has consistently sided with the leaders of the two major parties when internal party conflicts arise and why it has taken positions in favor of entrench\u00ading the two-party system.\r\n\r\nFor one, the Court consistently rules in favor of the party leader\u00adship\u2019s control of the brand in conflicts between leaders and members. In decision after decision, the Court has permitted the party leadership to utilize the First Amendment as a shield by which it may secure exclusive control of the candidates it will field.[footnote]See N.Y.

Most notably, in 2000, the Supreme Court struck down California\u2019s blanket primary, which was open to nonparty voters.[footnote]Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 586 (2000).[\/footnote] In doing so, it criticized the State\u2019s effort to \u201cchang[e] the parties\u2019 message\u201d and explained it was the decision to deprive the party of control over its preferred candidate that rendered the scheme constitu\u00adtionally infirm.[footnote]Id. at 581\u201382; see also Democratic Party of Wash.

See, e.g., Democratic Party of Haw. v. Nago, 833 F.3d 1119, 1124 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2114 (2017); see also Ravalli Cty. Republican Cent. Comm. v. McCulloch, 655 F. App\u2019x 592, 593 (9th. Cir. 2016) (dismissing as moot the appeal of a denial of injunctive relief regarding an election that had already occurred).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Supreme Court\u2019s commitment to robust First Amendment rights frequently fades when the political party asserting those rights is a minor party.[footnote]Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 367 (1997) (noting \u201c[t]he Constitution permits the Minnesota legislature to decide that political stability is best served through a healthy two-party system\u201d and thus permits the enactment of \u201creasonable election regulations that may, in practice, favor the traditional two-party system\u201d); see also Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 199 (1986) (upholding a state statute that conditioned a candidate\u2019s appearance on the ballot in a general election on the candidate having received at least 1% of the votes in a primary election).

Beaver<\/em>\u2019s rejection of the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma\u2019s challenge to the state\u2019s semiclosed primary, which permitted political parties to invite independent voters but not voters registered as partisans of other parties into their primary, is thus not an anomaly, as some have suggested.[footnote]544 U.S. 581, 584, 598 (2005) (plurality opinion).[\/footnote] Invoking the line of cases that protect party leaders\u2019 control of the brand, the Libertarian Party argued it had a constitutionally protected right to diffuse its brand by allowing in voters who were Democrats and Republicans in the interest of selecting a more viable candidate for the general election.[footnote]Id. at 594 (\u201cIt does not matter that the LPO is willing to risk the surrender of its identity in exchange for electoral success.\u201d).[\/footnote] This argument fell on deaf ears. Instead, the Court found that the burden placed by the semiclosed primary on the party, which it characterized as minimal, was easily justified by the state\u2019s interest in protecting strong parties.

In [<em>California Democratic Party v.<\/em> <em>Jones<\/em>], the Court concluded that the associational interests of the parties trumped state interests that were much more compelling than those asserted in this case. Here, by contrast, where the associational interests are being asserted by a minor party rather than by one of the dominant parties, the Court has reversed course and rejected those associational interests as insubstantial compared to the interests asserted by the State.[footnote]Id. at 619 n.11 (Stevens, J., dissenting).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nIn sum, the Supreme Court has long accepted that the First Amendment rights of political parties should be allocated in ways that channel their self-interest to produce democratic accountability. The problem, as will be shown in the next section, is that the theoretical assumptions upon which the Supreme Court has predicated its party jurisprudence do not hold true in the real world of contemporary politics.\r\n<h3>B. Irresponsible Party Governance and the Need to Revisit the Theoretical Foundation of the Court\u2019s Party Jurisprudence<\/h3>\r\nWhatever the merits of responsible party government as a solution to the problems faced by mid-twentieth-century American parties, it has not panned out as anticipated. More ideologically distinct than in any prior era, the Democratic and Republican parties today are closer than ever before to the ideal called for by the APSA Committee on Political Parties.[footnote]See Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 276\u201377 (summarizing consensus on the polarization of the parties). One succinct measure of this trend is the changing perceptions of the political parties among independent voters. In 1956, around the time of the APSA Report, \u201c64% of independents in 1956 failed to see a difference between the two parties on at least one of the five more salient issues, compared to 21% of strong partisans;\u201d by contrast, in 2012, only 14% of independents failed to recognize some issue differences between the parties. Corwin D. Smidt, Polarization and the Decline of the American Floating Voter, 61 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 365, 365, 368\u201369, 369 fig.2, 371, 373 (2017) (demonstrating \u201cthe clarity of differences between the two polarized parties makes it easy for\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

As Professors Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson note wryly, \u201cWhat the committee coveted\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. was responsible party government.

The verdict, on this point, is unequivocal. Professor Larry Bartels has summed up the data as follows: \u201cWhatever elections may be doing, they are <em>not <\/em>forcing elected officials to cater to the policy preferences of the \u2018median voter.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Bartels, supra note 21, at 287.[\/footnote] In fact, while \u201c[t]he scope for independent action by elected leaders\u201d is \u201cespecially great in cases where public sentiment is divided, unstable, confused, or simply nonexistent[,]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the paucity of elite responsiveness to public opinion extends even to issues on which public opinion seems to be unusually firm and stable.\u201d[footnote]Id. Bartels further notes that \u201c[i]n most cases, even massive differences in the preferences of middle- and upper-income constituents\u201d have little \u201ceffect on senators\u2019 policy choices\u201d especially as compared to \u201ctheir own partisan ideologies.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] He is not alone in his assessment.[footnote]See, e.g., Gilens, supra note 52, at 83, 163, 166 (\u201cWhatever empirical validity median voter models may hold with regard to the professed positions of parties and candi\u00addates, the findings presented above [with respect to the years 1981 through 2002] clearly show that actual government policy does not respond to the preferences of the median voter.\u201d); Anthony Fowler &amp; Andrew B. Hall, Long-Term Consequences of Election Results, 47 Brit. J. Pol. Sci. 351, 354, 358, 366 (2015) (concluding a study of policy responsiveness in competitive moderate districts with the assessment that \u201c[a]cross American legislatures, elected representatives do not converge to the median voter in their constituency\u201d); Joe Soss &amp; Lawrence R.

Q. 95, 116 (2009) (\u201cIn recent decades, government officials have exhibited weak and declining levels of responsiveness to median public preferences.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEqually as important, the political parties that have emerged are remarkably ineffective at governing.[footnote]See, e.g., Sarah A. Binder, Stalemate: Causes and Consequences of Legislative Gridlock 25\u201326, 67\u201369 (2003) (demonstrating ways that party homogeneity undermines policy responsiveness by breeding polarization and gridlock); Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 808 (noting the government\u2019s inability to act even with res\u00adpect to issues that are pressing and with respect to which there is broad consensus).[\/footnote] Responsible party governance was predicated on the notions that the elected party would be capable of adopting the programs to which it had committed and, thus, could be judged on its legislative record come election day.[footnote]APSA Report, supra note 54, at 1.[\/footnote] The recent norm, however, has been gridlock in Congress and aggrandized presidential power to compensate for Congress\u2019s inability to act.[footnote]One\u2019s normative assessment of gridlock, obviously, varies depending on whether one is generally opposed to federal legislative action as unnecessary or an infringement on states\u2019 rights. Those who adhere to responsible party government, however, generally do not have a principled objection to governance at the federal level. Cf. Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 808 (assuming that in \u201carenas where there is broad consensual agreement that government <em>must <\/em>act, in some fashion,\u201d it is a problem that it \u201cseems incapable of doing so\u201d).[\/footnote] Nor has the return of unified government produced decisive governance.[footnote]See, e.g., Sheryl Gay Stolberg &amp; Nicholas Fandos, As Gridlock Deepens in Congress, Only Gloom Is Bipartisan, N.Y.

Professor Alan I. Abramowitz, for example, concedes that \u201calthough the conditions for responsible party government have largely been met on the electoral side, with ideologically defined parties offering voters a clear choice between alternative sets of policies,\u201d responsible and effective party governance has not followed.[footnote]Alan I. Abramowitz, The Disappearing Center: Engaged Citizens, Polarization, and American Democracy 160 (2010) [hereinafter Abramowitz, The Disappearing Center]. Abramowitz further argues that it is the structural features of divided government that are the \u201cmajor obstacle to effective party governance,\u201d rather than the prescriptions of the strong party thesis or the absence of party competition. Id.[\/footnote] Professor Seth Masket, meanwhile, grants that while the two major political parties are more ideologically distinct, including at the state level, than ever before, the accountability that has emerged has largely been to primary voters, donors, and other policy demanders capable of mounting credible primary challenges.[footnote]Masket, supra note 38, at 24\u201325 (noting a \u201cvirtual consensus\u201d that \u201c[c]andidates no longer converge on the median voter\u201d but rather \u201crepresent[] the ideologically extreme elements within their parties, despite the electoral risk that this strategy carries\u201d).[\/footnote] In Masket\u2019s view, the primary obstacle to accountability has been the unforeseen conse\u00adquences of the move to closed primary elections, which lead \u201clegislators [to] look to their party first and to their district second.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 93. Masket argues that \u201cthe view of officeholders as single-minded seekers of reelection,\u201d who tack back to the median voter, \u201chas little relevance [today], not because officeholders don\u2019t care about the electoral connection\u201d but because strong nominating parties today \u201cinterpose themselves between officeholders and voters and often thoroughly dominate the relationship.\u201d Id. at 19; see also Gilens, supra note 52, at 9\u201310 (\u201cMy findings seem to support the notion that parties in the United States have evolved from broad-based, vote-maximizing organizations attentive to the preferences of large and diverse publics to coalitions of intense, narrow \u2018policy demanders.\u2019\u201d); Soss &amp; Jacobs, supra note 84, at 117\u201318 (summarizing evidence that \u201c[t]he rising power of party activists has created strong incentives for politicians to discount the preferences of broad public opin\u00adion\u201d including, for instance, popular opinion on immigration reform). But see Ansolabehere et al., supra note 21, at 154 (arguing that it is the usefulness of a coherent legislative party to self-interested incumbents, rather than the presence of an ideologically extreme base, that accounts for candidates\u2019 failure to closely hew to constituents\u2019 preferences).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nYet, political scientists and legal academics continue to adhere to responsible party government almost as an article of faith.[footnote]See, e.g., Masket, supra note 38, at 24\u201325, 95\u201396, 195 (asserting that accountabil\u00adity to the party base, notwithstanding its failures, is preferable to diffuse accountability to the electorate insofar as the base and party operatives are better positioned to monitor the actions of legislators and thus thwart lobbyists from buying elected officials); see also Issacharoff, Outsourcing Politics, supra note 4, at 855, 861 (noting that members of the party in government \u201cforemost look[] to winning elections\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. by hewing close enough to the center of the political distribution of voters\u201d and concluding that \u201c\u2018stronger parties\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. might be the most effective vehicle for enabling the compromises and deals necessary to enable more effective governance\u2019\u201d (quoting Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 809\u201310)).[\/footnote] Meanwhile, there is little evidence that the general public\u2019s experience of the United States\u2019 newly polarized democracy is positive.[footnote]See John Wagner &amp; Scott Clement, \u2018It\u2019s Just Messed Up\u2019: Most Think Political Divisions as Bad as Vietnam Era, New Poll Shows, Wash.

Instead, the tendency in legal circles has been to focus on the most obvious fix, a theoretical patch, so to speak: increase party competition.[footnote]See, e.g., Samuel Issacharoff, Gerrymandering and Political Cartels, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 593, 629\u201330 (2002) (\u201c[A] focus on the competitive implications of rules governing the political process allows for confined yet effective court oversight to guard against con\u00adduct that frustrates democratic accountability.\u201d); Issacharoff &amp; Pildes, supra note 25, at 707 (arguing that there is a \u201chistorical basis\u201d for believing that political competition could counter vote dilution); see also Michael S. Kang, Race and Democratic Contestation, 117 Yale L.J. 734, 801\u201302 (2008) (noting that a theory of democratic contestation can provide a \u201csubstantive vision for healthy democratic politics\u201d); David Schleicher, \u201cPolitics as Markets\u201d Reconsidered: Natural Monopolies, Competitive Democratic Philosophy and Primary Ballot Access in American Elections, 14 Sup. Ct. Econ. Rev. 163, 176\u201387 (2006) (analyzing models of political contestation).[\/footnote] On this account, the strategic choice to cater to the ideologically extreme party base depends on knowing one is a shoo-in during the general election because the district is safe for one\u2019s party.[footnote]Jonathan Rauch summarizes the view succinctly: \u201cWalled safely inside their gerry\u00admandered districts, incumbents are insulated from general-election challenges that might pull them toward the political center, but they are perpetually vulnerable to primary challenges from extremists who pull them toward the fringes.\u201d Rauch, supra note 8; see also Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1151 (\u201c[T]he lack of partisan competition has unmoored political parties and candidates from the interests of their constituents. With the rise of safe districts, the party primary has increasingly become the most important election.\u201d).[\/footnote] Increasing party competition should therefore resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nWhether this would in fact work is somewhat disputed. On the one hand, data do show increased responsiveness where there is party competition and decreased responsiveness while one party dominates.[footnote]Martin Gilens\u2019s seminal investigation of policy responsiveness finds, for instance, that party competition, both in the electoral sphere and in legislatures, somewhat increases convergence toward the preferences of the public. See Gilens, supra note 52, at 192, 194 (concluding that \u201chigh levels of political competition in the form of an evenly divided Congress\u201d increases policy responsiveness while \u201celections appear to be only modestly successful at aligning policy outcomes with the preferences of the public\u201d). See generally id. at 162\u2013233 (comprehensively analyzing the degree to which elections prompt responsiveness as well as the effect of divided versus unified government on policy responsiveness). More specifically, Gilens found that \u201cpolicy responsiveness is\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. highest during the first congressional session after a shift in partisan control of the presidency\u201d but that dominance of one party generally reduces responsiveness to the elec\u00adtorate over time and enables the party to pursue its own agenda. Id. at 83, 163, 166. Despite these modest findings Gilens recommends \u201creforms that enhance political competition\u201d insofar as they \u201ccan intensify\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the responsiveness of policy makers.\u201d Id. at 10.[\/footnote] On the other hand, there are data questioning how much competition affects responsiveness given that voters rarely cast their votes based on overall legislative performance as theorized in the traditional model of responsible party government.[footnote]For example, a recent study by Anthony Fowler and Andrew B. Hall of competi\u00adtive moderate districts found Democratic and Republican legislators represent identical districts differently, demonstrating that officials elected in competitive elections do not necessarily cater to the median voter in their roll-call votes. Fowler &amp; Hall, supra note 84, at 351\u201352. Moreover, the discrepancy between legislators\u2019 roll-call votes and the prefer\u00adences of their districts does not lessen over time, and despite what one might expect, those elected officials are not kicked out of office for their policy divergence. Id. at 354\u201359. In sum, the authors conclude that \u201c[a]cross American legislatures, elected representatives do not converge to the median voter in their constituency.\u201d Id. at 352, 354\u201359, 364\u201368; accord Binder, supra note 85, at 108\u201311 (demonstrating that incumbents \u201cdo not pay an electoral price\u201d for legislative performance); Ansolabehere et al., supra note 21, at 154 (arguing partisanship rather than the presence of an ideologically extreme base accounts for candi\u00addates\u2019 failure to closely hew to constituents\u2019 preferences); see also Drutman, supra note 7 (summarizing recent literature).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBut here is the catch: Even if increasing party competition would substantially improve policy responsiveness, as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, that patch is off the table. The Court has been singularly unreceptive to structuring First Amendment doctrine in ways that increase party competition.[footnote]Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos, Elections and Alignment, 114 Colum. L. Rev. 283, 288, 291\u201398 (2014) (defending alignment theory, in part, on grounds that the existing literature\u2019s focus on structural concerns\u2014participation and competition\u2014has had no traction with the Court).[\/footnote] At times, it has even been openly hostile to the suggestion that there might be a constitutional interest in fostering electoral competition. In <em>New York State Board of Elections v. Lopez Torres<\/em>, a case in which judicial candidates challenged New York\u2019s cumbersome ballot access rules, the Court declared:\r\n<blockquote>The reason one-party rule is entrenched may be (and usually is) that voters approve of the positions and candidates that the party regularly puts forward.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The States can, within [constitutional] limits\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. discourage party monopoly\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But the Constitution provides no authority for federal courts to prescribe such a course. <em>The First Amendment creates an open marketplace where ideas<\/em>, most especially political ideas, may compete without government interference. <em>It does not call on the federal courts to manage the market by preventing too many buyers from settling upon a single product.<\/em>[footnote]N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, 208 (2008) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nLegislators, meanwhile, have zero incentive to approve measures aimed to increase partisan competition.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, time to reckon with the need for a theoretical overhaul. Whatever its merits at the time, a variety of developments in American politics since the 1950s, including those in election law, have undercut responsible party government\u2019s usefulness as a framework through which to achieve democratic responsiveness and accountability.\r\n\r\nThe Court\u2019s recent refusal to consider two cases involving First Amendment challenges on behalf of political parties squarely framed in terms of responsible party government theory provides a window of opportunity, possibly indicating that some members of the Court are growing wary of the path it has forged.[footnote]Democratic Party of Haw. v. Nago, 833 F.3d 1119, 1124 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2114 (2017); Republican Party of La. v. FEC, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86, 90\u201391 (D.D.C. 2016), summarily aff\u2019d, 137 S. Ct. 2178 (2017).[\/footnote] In fact, cracks in the responsible party government consensus may already be evident.\r\n\r\n<em>Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party<\/em> involved a challenge to the primary system Washington voters adopted when its blanket primary was struck down in the wake of <em>California Democratic Party v. Jones<\/em>.[footnote]552 U.S. 442, 444 (2008); see also Democratic Party of Wash. State v. Reed, 343 F.3d 1198, 1201\u201302 (9th Cir. 2003) (describing the history of Washington\u2019s blanket primary system).[\/footnote] Under Washington\u2019s new system, voters, regardless of party affil\u00adiation, are permitted to vote for any of the candidates seeking nomina\u00adtion for a given seat. The top two vote-getters for each office advance to the general election, creating the possibility that two candidates from the same party may run against one another in the general election.[footnote]See <em>Wash. State Grange<\/em>, 552 U.S. at 444.[\/footnote] Unlike in the traditional blanket primary, candidates select their party affiliation.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe challengers argued that the new blanket primary procedure was constitutionally infirm because nominees associated with the political party were not exclusively chosen by members of the party.[footnote]Id. at 452\u201353.[\/footnote] In this regard, the fundamental constitutional burden placed on a political party was exactly the same as in <em>Jones<\/em>: The party had been stripped of control over its brand, as candidates selected by the system were not authentic representatives of the party.[footnote]Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 581\u201382 (2000).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Court, however, dismissed these arguments out of hand, noting, \u201cThe nonpartisan blanket primary \u2018has all the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a party\u2019s nominee.\u2019\u201d[footnote]<em>Wash. State Grange<\/em>, 552 U.S. at 452 (quoting <em>Jones<\/em>, 530 U.S. at 585\u201386).[\/footnote] Washington\u2019s new primary system was constitutional under <em>Jones <\/em>because it did not purport to select party representatives; it selected the two most popular candidates for office to be placed on the general election ballot regardless of party affiliation.[footnote]Id. at 453 (\u201cThe flaw\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. in [the challengers\u2019] argument is that, unlike the California primary, the I\u2013872 primary\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018does not serve to determine the nominees of a political party but serves to winnow the number of candidates to a final list of two for the general election.\u2019\u201d (quoting Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a0434-262-012 (2005))).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe reasoning in <em>Washington State Grange<\/em> cannot easily be squared with a commitment to responsible party government theory. As Justice Scalia argued in dissent, the very purpose of a blanket primary\u2014partisan or nonpartisan\u2014is to moderate the candidates that appear on the general election ballot.[footnote]Id. at 470 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cThere is no state interest behind this law except the Washington Legislature\u2019s dislike for bright-colors partisanship, and its desire to blunt the ability of political parties with noncentrist views to endorse and advocate their own candidates.\u201d).[\/footnote] Driving the point home, he wrote:\r\n<blockquote>Among the First Amendment rights that political parties possess is the right to associate with the persons whom they choose and to refrain from associating with persons whom they reject. Also included is the freedom to choose and promote \u201c\u2018the standard bearer who best represents the party\u2019s ideologies and preferences.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen an expressive organization is compelled to associate with a person whose views the group does not accept, the organization\u2019s <em>message<\/em> is undermined; the organization is understood to embrace, or at the very least tolerate, the views of the persons linked with them.[footnote]Id. at 463 (emphasis added) (citations omitted) (quoting Eu v. S.F. Cty. Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 224 (1989)).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe constitutional foul of the nonpartisan primary remains the same, according to Justice Scalia, for individuals are allowed to \u201cappropriate the parties\u2019 trademarks\u201d at the critical juncture in an election, thus muddying the parties\u2019 messaging.[footnote]Id. at 471.[\/footnote] Further, the general election ballot may require a party to associate with a candidate that it perceives as being non\u00adrepresentative of its views.[footnote]Id. at 462. Justice Scalia went on to remark:\r\n\"Recognizing that parties draw support for their candidates by giving them the party <em>imprimatur<\/em>, Washington seeks to reduce the effectiveness of that endorsement by allowing <em>any<\/em> candidate to use the ballot for draw\u00ading upon the goodwill that a party has developed, while preventing the party from using the ballot to reject the claimed association or to iden\u00adtify the genuine candidate of its choice.\"\r\nId. at 464\u201365.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn sum, responsible party government has run its course as a basis either for allocating First Amendment rights to political parties or for devising party regulations in the interest of good governance. A variety of developments in American politics and law since the 1950s have undercut responsible party government\u2019s usefulness as a framework through which to achieve democratic responsiveness and accountability. In this regard, the Court\u2019s recent decisions are an invitation to consider a fresh path to responsive and accountable democratic governance.\r\n<h2>II. Forging a New Path to Responsive and Accountable Governance<\/h2>\r\nIt is time, therefore, to turn to the central contribution of this Essay: the development of an alternative theoretical foundation for achieving policy responsiveness through political parties. Drawing upon the empirical research on the drivers of political participation in both political science and sociology, this Part explains why measures targeted toward cultivating, strengthening, and broadening social ties within partisan networks present an alternative, and underappreciated, path to responsive and accountable governance. The argument is developed in four stages. Section II.A lays out key premises, including the operative definition of a political party, while introducing an overview of an associational-party path to responsive governance. Section II.B describes the empirical basis for believing that social ties not only breed political participation but also offset the limits to voters\u2019 interest and knowledge in politics by facilitating information transmission. The heavy lifting comes in section II.C, which draws out the implications of the empirical research for an alternative path to responsive governance. Finally, section II.D squarely addresses various bases for skepticism, arguing that, whatever its limits, a party-reform agenda tailored to strengthening the associational life of political parties\u2014including by redirecting the flow of money\u2014is significantly more promising than one that is singularly focused on strengthening the political power of party leaders.\r\n<h3>A. An Associational Path to Responsive Party Government<\/h3>\r\nThe puzzle of how to curb the tendency of elected officials to act out of self-interest or at the behest of special interests has plagued the repub\u00adlic since the Founding. Even as the Founders aspired to a republican form of government in which legislators would govern in the public interest, rather than simply vindicate their constituents\u2019 particularized advantages, they fretted over the potential for elected representatives to act out of self-interest or at the behest of special interests.[footnote]Robert C. Post, Citizens Divided: Campaign Finance Reform and the Constitution 15 (2014) (explaining the Founding generation\u2019s understanding that \u201ca representative government can fulfill the promise of self-government only if there is a close connection between representatives and their constituents\u201d).[\/footnote] Throughout the ratification debates, for instance, Anti-Federalists raised concerns that the new Constitution would give rise to \u201ca system in which the people would be effectively excluded from the world of public affairs and in which national leaders, only weakly accountable, would have enormous discretion to make law and policy.\u201d[footnote]Geoffrey R. Stone, Louis Michael Seidman, Cass R. Sunstein, Mark V. Tushnet &amp; Pamela S. Karlan, Constitutional Law 10 (7th ed. 2013).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution\u2019s primary answer to the threat of unaccountable politicians is periodic elections.[footnote]See Post, supra note 114, at 13 (noting the Federalists\u2019 position that frequent elections would serve to keep elected officials responsive); see also The Federalist No. 53, at 330 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (noting that \u201cwhere annual elections end, tyranny begins\u201d while wrestling with the question of the optimal interval for elec\u00adtions).[\/footnote] Regular elections, it was thought, would guarantee that representatives remained bound to their constitu\u00adents. The structural features of separation of powers and federalism would provide \u201cauxiliary precautions.\u201d[footnote]The Federalist No. 51, at 322 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (describing the structural devices of federalism and separation of powers as \u201cauxiliary precautions\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe shortcomings of elections as instruments for ensuring respon\u00adsiveness are well known.[footnote]While some argue that it is incoherent to speak of responsive governance because the electorate is incapable of having a preference, this Essay takes a pragmatic stance. In some theoretical sense this is no doubt true, but it is too far from our political culture or the law to be a valuable critique. For a summary of this extreme skepticism, see Schleicher, supra note 96, at 181\u201386 (explaining the critique but arguing that it is sufficient that voters have some political views and some capacity to judge their interests and preferences).[\/footnote] Among their myriad limitations as vehicles for producing accountability, one has proven particularly intractable: the quality of political participation. Even in a world of competitive districts in which turnout is high and representative, democratic accountability turns on voters having sufficient information to assess the adequacy of representation.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1152 (noting \u201c[v]oters cannot hold elected officials accountable if they do not know [what those offi\u00adcials have done]\u201d and observing that \u201celected officials who engage in off-center politics depend on the voting public not noticing\u201d); cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14\u201315 (1976) (recognizing that \u201c[i]n a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citi\u00adzenry <em>to make informed choices among<\/em> candidates for office is essential\u201d (emphasis added)).[\/footnote] Unfortunately, individuals face significant barriers when it comes to monitoring elected officials, and policy ignorance among voters is much more common than is policy knowledge.[footnote]See, e.g., Bawn et al., supra note 51, at 577\u201378 (identifying a large \u201cblind spot\u201d with respect to information about official behavior, which renders ordinary voters incapa\u00adble of holding politicians accountable through monitoring).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nResponsible party government pursued an indirect solution to the pervasiveness of voter ignorance. Presenting voters on election day with a choice between clear ideological brands, it hypothesized, would substi\u00adtute for actual knowledge.[footnote]See supra notes 52\u201355 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Meanwhile, an interest in winning office would incentivize the production of brands responsive to voter prefer\u00adences.[footnote]See Daniel Hays Lowenstein, Associational Rights of Major Political Parties: A Skeptical Inquiry, 71 Tex. L. Rev. 1741, 1760\u201363 (1993) (discussing the theory of responsi\u00adble party government).[\/footnote] As in the economic market, political parties would compete to provide the most desirable good, and accountability would follow.\r\n\r\nThe shortcut proved to be fool\u2019s gold. Merely consuming the political brands manufactured by party elites has not been enough to produce accountability.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7 (summarizing recent literature).[\/footnote] Despite the increasingly clear choice voters face, the weight of the evidence confirms the Anti-Federalists\u2019 worst fears.[footnote]See supra notes 115\u2013117 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] At the national level, our leaders are millionaires, \u201conly weakly accountable\u201d to the people, who leverage their enormous policy discretion largely to the advantage of others like themselves.[footnote]Stone et al., supra note 115, at 10; see also Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1136\u201340 (reviewing literature demonstrating that Congress is significantly more responsive to the wealthy than to the broader electorate).[\/footnote] Donors and ideological partisans have become the target audience for party brands, and concern for the preferences of the general electorate is largely coincidental.[footnote]See, e.g., Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1163\u201370 (explaining how party primaries today drive a wedge between elected officials and their constituents); Martin Gilens &amp; Benjamin I.

It is worth emphasizing that none of the main critics of Professors Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page\u2019s study substantially under\u00admine their conclusion that the United States is a \u201cdemocracy by coincidence.\u201d See, e.g., Peter K.

The relationship between electoral participation and democratic accountability is certainly complex. Still, the necessity of a threshold level of representative political participation\u2014including on election day\u2014is indisputable. No one, not even the authors of the APSA Report, denies that participation of citizens is necessary for account\u00adability.[footnote]See APSA Report, supra note 54, at 76 (\u201cIt is only at the polls that a party can be held finally accountable for its promises and its deeds. And it is through the act of election to a greater extent than through anything else that more widespread popular participation may be achieved in the political process.\u201d).[\/footnote] In fact, the APSA Report identified the \u201c<em>failure to bring about adequate popular participation in politics<\/em>\u201d as one of the two \u201cconspicuous failings\u201d of the two political parties.[footnote]Id. at 25 (emphasis added); see also id. at 30, 76 (arguing low voter turnout \u201cis the result of disappointment as well as inertia\u201d and that \u201c[m]ore significant operation of the party system would create greater interest in voting\u201d but also in party membership).[\/footnote] The primary dispute, therefore, turns on whether it is possible to create an informed electorate.[footnote]See generally Michael X.

Democracy 65, 66 (1995) (\u201cThe norms and networks of civic engagement also powerfully affect the performance of representative government.\u201d).[\/footnote] It is no accident that federal policy is highly solicitous of the needs of older Americans; they succeed in asserting their interests because they are more politically active and better organized than most Americans.[footnote]See, e.g., Hacker &amp; Pierson, supra note 81, at 77\u201379 (2005); see also Jacob S.

Similarly, gun-rights supporters who are members of the National Rifle Association (NRA) are notably more politically active than gun owners who do not belong to the NRA. Some 46% of gun owners in the NRA say they have contacted a public official to express their opinion on gun policy, including 24% who have done so in the past 12 months. Far fewer gun owners who do not belong to the NRA have reached out to a public official regarding gun policy: only 15% have ever done this, and just 5% have done this in the past 12 months.

In this regard, it is important to acknowledge the ways in which theory shapes research agendas. Most studies of differential voter knowledge are predicated on the assumption that knowledge is the springboard to participation, not the inverse. It is, thus, not an accident that polls on differential knowledge among voters rarely ask about the partisan associa\u00adtions to which such individuals belong, let alone whether those individuals have been con\u00adtacted by partisan networks. See, e.g., Michael Dimock et al., Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology 93\u201398 (2014), http:\/\/assets.pewresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\r\n\/5\/2014\/06\/6-26-14-Political-Typology-release1.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/E34E-58UZ].[\/footnote]While voter igno\u00adrance is certainly pervasive, it need not preclude a path to political accountability in which informed political participation plays a critical role. That route, however, becomes visible only when one puts social ties and membership organizations back into the picture.[footnote]Compare Bruce E. Cain, Democracy More or Less: America\u2019s Political Quandary 11, 16 (2015) (emphasizing voter ignorance as an explanation for why \u201cpopular sover\u00adeignty\u201d is an \u201cillusion\u201d and why we must return to a pluralistic approach to politics in which democratic accountability is achieved through democratic competition between interest groups and political parties), with infra section II.B (arguing that social ties, relationships, and associations play a vital role in political mobilization and engagement).[\/footnote] A substantial body of empirical work supports the hypothesis that intermediary associations, including political parties, can spur political participation and facilitate a two-way street of communication between elites and ordinary citizens.[footnote]See infra section II.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAn associational path to responsive and accountable party govern\u00adance emerges from this empirical evidence demonstrating the critically important role that association and associations play in mobilizing and informing citizens. It capitalizes on the fact that, as Professor Daniel Lowenstein has astutely remarked, \u201cthe term \u2018party\u2019 can be and is used with greatly disparate referents.\u201d[footnote]Lowenstein, supra note 122, at 1760.[\/footnote] While responsible party government adopted a relatively formalist conception of the party as its officers, the associational-party path exploits the sociological fact that the contempo\u00adrary party organization is a network of individuals and groups connected formally and informally in their efforts to influence elections and government policy.[footnote]See, e.g., Masket, supra note 38, at 19, 45 (noting \u201cthe shape of the modern party is more of a network than a machine hierarchy\u201d while emphasizing its focus on shared electoral goals); Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 143 (noting the \u201cdiversity of motiva\u00adtions and interests\u201d of partisan actors but emphasizing their broader \u201coverlapping political goals\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFrom an associational-party perspective, the relevant definition of a political party is a sociological one in which \u201c[t]he term \u2018party\u2019 is a colloquial shorthand to describe\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. <em>a loose collection of political relation\u00adships<\/em>, some legal and some non-legal, among a diverse set of actors and institutions, all of whom perform important work in furtherance of a common [electoral, policy, and ideological] agenda.\u201d[footnote]Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 133 (emphasis added).[\/footnote] The party network certainly includes the well-known trinity of elected officials (also known as \u201cthe party in office or seeking office\u201d); \u201cparty activists,\u201d including paid party operatives and volunteers; and voters (\u201cthe party in the electorate\u201d).[footnote]Larry J. Sabato, The Party\u2019s Just Begun: Shaping Political Parties for America\u2019s Future 26\u201327 (1988).[\/footnote] But it is significantly broader, including not only legislative caucuses[footnote]For an interesting account of congressional membership organizations and their success in pooling resources and disciplining members in the quest for donations and power, see generally Andrew J. Clarke, Party Sub-Brands and American Party Factions (2017) (unpublished working paper), http:\/\/www.andrewjclarke.net\/uploads\/2\/8\/0\/2\/\r\n28027431\/party_sub-brands_and_american_party_factions__clarke_.pdf (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] but also nonparty entities and policy demanders such as the AFL-CIO, Club for Growth, and NRA.[footnote]Some political scientists exclude these partisan civic associations from their definition. See, e.g., Richard Skinner et al., 527 Committees, Formal Parties, and Party Adaptation, 11 Forum 137, 144 (2013) (distinguishing between 527s that are \u201cdeeply embedded within the formal party structure[]\u201d and subservient to their partisan goals, and certain policy-demanding groups, such as Club for Growth or Planned Parenthood, which while \u201cgenerally aligned with a party\u201d are not \u201cautomatically subservient to th[e] party\u2019s desires\u201d). Donors, which most political scientists include within the definition, however, are also not \u201cautomatically subservient\u201d to the party, so it is not entirely satisfactory to treat the two groups differently as some definitions do. Id.[\/footnote] As Professor Michael Kang summarizes:\r\n<blockquote>Beyond a party\u2019s nominees or titular officials (such as the party chairman, spokespeople, and employees), the party comprises\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a teeming, polyarchic aggregation of politically interested constituents. The kaleidoscopic mass of political activists, volunteers, financial contributors, interest groups, PACs, lawyers, consultants, journalists, and intellectuals who perform important work aligned with the party\u2019s collective agenda are not necessarily bound formally to or paid by the official party.[footnote]Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 143.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe sociological perspective further recognizes that elected officials and party leaders operate within the confines of the official party organiza\u00adtion only when it suits their interests.[footnote]Id. at 147, 158 (noting an early instance in which Wisconsin political parties\u2014in response to Progressive-era reforms\u2014transformed themselves into civic associations and explaining how this shift into an informal network pushed \u201cstrategic behavior\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. deeper into the quiet background of politics\u201d); see also Skinner et al., supra note 141, at 141 (arguing that 527s emerged as an adaptation within the party network to accommodate the legislative ban on soft money and providing as evidence that the \u201cbest-connected 527s tend[ed] to have a high[er] percentage of employees who ha[d] also worked for formal party organizations and top presidential campaigns\u201d).[\/footnote] The legal entities of campaign finance are largely window dressing, even as the formal rights of such entities can and do reshape the texture of partisan networks.[footnote]The Obama campaign\u2019s concerted effort to obscure the existence of different legal entities by naming them such that they could all be referred to by the same acro\u00adnym\u2014\u201cOFA\u201d\u2014nicely illustrates this point. Elizabeth McKenna &amp; Hahrie Han, Groundbreakers: How Obama\u2019s 2.2 Million Volunteers Transformed Campaigning in America 4 n.2 (2014) (describing how the acronym blurred the distinction between Obama for America (the official campaign) and Organizing for America (a 501(c)(4)), inducing campaign workers to think of themselves as working for state parties even though the money to cover their salaries came from transfers from Obama for America); see also Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 142\u201343 (noting \u201cthe core constellation of leading actors in a political party extends far beyond the party\u2019s legal apparatus\u201d and further that \u201cthe law captures only a small portion of the activity and people referenced when we refer colloquially to a \u2018political party\u2019\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOnce we see the full scope of the party, it is evident that legal efforts to sustain and build out political parties <em>as associations<\/em> provide an alternate, and far more promising, path to democratic responsiveness and accountability, especially when married with similar efforts to enhance the associational life of contemporary civic associations.\r\n\r\nContemporary party organizations, while not the membership organizations of bygone eras, have yet to shed their essential associational attributes.[footnote]See James L. Gibson et al., Assessing Party Organizational Strength, 27 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 193, 199\u2013201 (1983) (describing the division of labor in and professionalization of state party organizations between 1960 and 1980).[\/footnote] The era of nineteenth-century urban machine politics that depended on the confluence of relatively strong personal ties and a formal organization bound by patronage is long gone.[footnote]See McKenna &amp; Han, supra note 144, at 26\u201330 (describing the demise of local parties centered around ward and precinct workers who maintained personal connections with voters precisely in order to create a sense of indebtedness that would be paid on elec\u00adtion day). For a vivid history of nineteenth-century political parties, see generally Jean H. Baker, Affairs of Party (1983) (exploring the \u201cparty experience\u201d of mid-nineteenth-century Democrats); Gerald Leonard, The Invention of Party Politics (2002) (examining political parties in the early nineteenth century).[\/footnote] Yet, even in the twenty-first century, political parties remain networks of individuals and groups\u2014activists, donors, officeholders, and dealmakers\u2014tied together and to the electorate by social connections of various strengths.[footnote]Masket, supra note 38, at 19, 108\u201358 (depicting, vividly, the various associational qualities of these networks in California).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBeyond their capacity to act as vehicles for aggregating and amplify\u00ading preferences and perspectives, the formal parties have an associational life, although there is great variation in the depth and breadth of that life. The national committees of the two major political parties, for exam\u00adple, largely function as vessels through which to collect and distribute donations. Like other tertiary associations based in Washington, D.C., they are professionally managed and donor funded.[footnote]Compare Daniel J. Galvin, The Transformation of Political Institutions: Investments in Institutional Resources and Gradual Change in the National Party Committees, 26 Stud. Am. Pol. Dev. 50, 50\u201353 (2012) (describing the transition to \u201cparties in service\u201d), with Mark E. Warren, Democracy and Association 39 (2001) (describing ter\u00adtiary associations as professionally run membership-based interest groups funded by foundations or other donors, rather than by membership dues).[\/footnote] Their professional staffs are selected for their strong ties to elected officials and donors.[footnote]Cf. Gregory Koger et al., Partisan Webs: Information Exchange and Party Networks, 39 Brit. J. Pol. Sci. 633, 652 (2009) (finding \u201cformal party organizations tend to be information receivers\u201d that collect potential-donor and -voter lists from interest groups and partisan-affiliated media sources); Emily Cahn, DSCC Announces 2016 Staff, Roll Call (Nov. 21, 2014), http:\/\/www.rollcall.com\/news\/home\/dscc-announces-2016-staff-roster [http:\/\/perma.cc\/KMD5-CXUU] (introducing the 2016 members of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, many of whom had strong ties to the incoming DSCC chairman).[\/footnote] The primary interaction these committees have with the broader public is through membership donations, with at least some emphasis on small donors\u2014both because it is to their electoral advantage to do so and because federal law constrains their ability to solicit big donations.[footnote]Cf. Kenneth P. Vogel et al., Hillary\u2019s Cash Flow Issue: Red Flags in Finance Reports for Clinton, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Politico (Oct. 16, 2015), http:\/\/\r\nwww.politico.com\/story\/2015\/10\/hillary-clinton-fec-filing-cash-flow-problem-214870 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/R2PF-ENK7] (recognizing that Hillary Clinton\u2019s big donors were quickly maxing out and recommending that she \u201csignificantly expand her fundraising base to include more small donors, who can\u2014and usually do\u2014continue giving throughout the race\u201d).[\/footnote] Small donations do not necessarily lead to social interaction with party elites. Even so, such entities are able to collect money only because they are situated within a partisan social network capable of mobilizing voters on election day. Other nodes within the formal party operate more like the parties of the nineteenth century. Organizations like the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) remain participatory and federated, and they regularly bridge ties between party elites and activists.[footnote]See Democratic National Committee\u20142016, Democracy in Action, http:\/\/\r\nwww.p2016.org\/parties\/dnc16.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/FCH4-VKCE] (last visited Jan. 17, 2018) (listing the members of the DNC and their diverse backgrounds and affiliations).[\/footnote] Super donors, meanwhile, operate in insular social and professional networks; their strong ties to one another enhance both their ability to fundraise and their access to party leaders.[footnote]Cf. Nicholas Confessore et al., The Families Funding the 2016 Presidential Election, N.Y. Times (Oct. 10, 2015), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2015\/10\/11\/\r\nus\/politics\/2016-presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (noting that \u201cacross party lines, [super donors] are patrons of the same symphonies, art museums or at-risk youth pro\u00adgrams,\u201d that they are \u201cbusiness partners, in-laws and, on occasion, even poker buddies,\u201d and that they frequently have pre-existing \u201cpersonal, regional and professional ties to the candidates\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe picture is equally complicated at the local level. While some local party organizations are well integrated with membership-based associations, such as labor unions, churches, and firefighter and law enforcement organizations, others are dominated by business interests and socially insulated from district constituencies.[footnote]See, e.g., Masket, supra note 38, at 14, 119\u201320, 180\u201384 (depicting local party net\u00adworks and their variations).[\/footnote] The power of the latter derives from the money that they provide to bankroll candidates rather than from the social networks they are capable of tapping on election day.[footnote]Id. at 182\u201383 (noting local party leaders, as business leaders, \u201caren\u2019t well known by rank-and-file primary voters;\u201d instead, their political power derives from \u201cthe funding advantage they provide\u201d to candidates).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWed to responsible party government and conceiving of parties narrowly and almost exclusively <em>as ideological speakers<\/em>, party reformers have been blind to the democratic potential arising out of the associational diversity within the partisan network. This blindness has prevented systematic consideration of both the part association can play in mobilizing and informing citizens and the ways that building out the associational life of contemporary political parties\u2014by shoring up those nodes of the partisan network capable of fostering social ties between elected officials and activists and between activists and constituents\u2014could contribute to good governance.\r\n<h3>B. The Democratic Returns of a Party\u2019s Associational Life<\/h3>\r\nWith a clearer sense of what is being proposed, it is time to review the empirical evidence demonstrating the critically important role that association and associations play in mobilizing and informing citizens. The existence of an associational path to responsive party governance derives from marrying the insight that contemporary political parties retain significant associational qualities with two relatively uncontrover\u00adsial empirical findings pointing to the significant political returns of those associational qualities. First, social ties, far more than ideological commitment, drive civic and political participation.[footnote]See infra notes 158\u2013166 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Second, infor\u00admation travels best through social networks.[footnote]See infra notes 182\u2013183 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe drivers of political participation are unquestionably multi\u00adfaceted, with time, money, education, civic skills, and political interest all playing significant roles.[footnote]See generally Henry H. Brady et al., Beyond SES: A Resource Model of Political Participation, 89 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 271, 271 (1995) [hereinafter Brady et al., Beyond SES] (identifying time, money, civic skills, political interest, and recruitment through social networks as the dominant explanations of individual political participation, based on a review of the literature).[\/footnote] Still, one finding emerges time and again: Individuals who are asked to engage civically and politically are far more likely to do so than those who are not.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, Friends, Associates, and Associations, supra note 32, at 80\u201385 (reviewing the empirical literature on this point). See generally Sidney Verba et al., Voice and Equality: Civic Voluntarism in American Politics 3\u20134 (1995) (finding \u201c[t]hose who have both the motivation and the capacity to become active are more likely to do so if they are asked,\u201d and further that motivation and capacity arise out of the social experiences, institutions, and associations to which individuals are exposed).[\/footnote] A recent inquiry into the drivers of participation in state politics, for example, found that \u201ccontact from the political parties and other organizations\u201d was \u201cespecially important in motivating participation in state politics.\u201d[footnote]Andrea McAtee &amp; Jennifer Wolak, Why People Decide to Participate in State Politics, 64 Pol. Res. Q. 45, 52 (2011) (using survey data from the 1990 American Citizen Participation Study to assess the drivers of political participation).[\/footnote] In doing so, it noted further that the organizational strength of state and local parties shaped the time and effort of those activated (a point to which this Essay will return later).[footnote]Id. at 51\u201352.[\/footnote] In this regard, it should not be surprising that a key attribute of nonvoters is that they have not been asked to vote.[footnote]See Benjamin Highton &amp; Raymond E.

Res. 331, 340 (2013) (finding \u201cthose who attend religious services more often are more likely to engage in civic activities and infor\u00admal helping not because of beliefs, politics, or general sociability, but because they have strong religious social networks\u201d); Doug McAdam, Recruitment to High-Risk Activism: The Case of Freedom Summer, 92 Am.

Second, they are efficient vectors when it comes to information transmission. These dynamics, moreover, are likely to be quite familiar to many of us: the discovery of the risks that the shortage of large-animal vets poses to our food supply learned from a college-age babysitter, the novel read based on a friend\u2019s recommenda\u00adtion, or the campaign house party attended because the host is a family friend.\r\n<h3>C. Party Strength\u2014Envisioning the Shape of a Responsive Party System<\/h3>\r\nThe heavy theoretical lifting that remains is an exploration of the implications of this empirical research for strengthening the political parties in the interest of responsive and accountable governance. First, what can we infer from this empirical research about the shape partisan networks would need take to yield democratic returns? Equally important, is it possible to nudge parties in that direction under current sociopolitical conditions? Ultimately, the remaining two sections of this Part aim to explain how a party-reform agenda tailored to broadening and strengthening the associational life of political parties could improve policy responsiveness notwithstanding what we know about the myriad sources of electoral dysfunction today.[footnote]For an overview of some of the salient dynamics that increasingly render elections incapable of tethering elected officials to the preferences of their constituents, see generally Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1151\u201357, 1161\u201374.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n1. <em>The Shape of Partisan Networks<\/em>. \u2014 Without denying that the causes of our crisis in representation are numerous, an associational path to responsible party governance takes as its starting point a significantly under\u00adappreciated transformation of the political landscape: the increas\u00ading social isolation of political elites and its impact on both participation and the flow of political information between ordinary Americans and their leaders.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the social networks of political elites today and those in prior eras of American history is both stark and revealing. While democratic politics is frequently a contest among elites,[footnote]The notion that democratic politics has long consisted of a contest among elites is the primary insight of the pluralist tradition of American politics, even as key figures within the tradition differ over how impenetrable elite power is. See generally Robert A. Dahl, Who Governs? Democracy and Power in an American City (1st ed. 1961); C. Wright Mills, The Power Elite (1st ed. 1956); E.E. Schattsneider, The Semisovereign People: A Realist\u2019s View of Democracy in America 35 (2d ed. 1975).[\/footnote] prior to the advent of mass media, candidates needed \u201cto build extensive interper\u00adsonal networks not confined to particular occupational or social circles\u201d to garner reputation and votes.[footnote]Theda Skocpol, Diminished Democracy: From Membership to Management in American Civic Life 113 (2004).[\/footnote] As such, the path to political power ran through membership in socioeconomically integrated civic associa\u00adtions\u2014the Shriners, the Rotary Club, the American Legion.[footnote]Id. at 108\u201313 (noting \u201cinvolvement in cross-class membership federations\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. contributed to U.S. electoral campaigns and helped democratic politicians to legitimate their aspirations for governmental leadership\u201d).[\/footnote] These groups required regular attendance at meetings and frequently involved election to higher offices and attendance at federated meetings.[footnote]Id. at 78\u201379, 85\u201393.[\/footnote] Political elites were thereby prevented from becoming socially insulated from the rest of American society.[footnote]See id. at 110 (noting further that biographies of prominent businessmen, politi\u00adcians, and professionals and their wives often involved long accounts of their membership in the same civic associations that record numbers of ordinary Americans joined as well).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBy contrast, electoral incentives today pull candidates and parties into a narrow social network of extremely unrepresentative and socially isolated donors and activists.[footnote]Cf.

A behavioral economist might describe this in terms of the availability heuristic; an anthropologist might describe it in terms of culture and social practice. The bottom line, however, is the same: Social context shapes what one prioritizes (e.g., tax cuts or social security), finds reasonable (e.g., accepting extravagant gifts from donors or engaging in an illicit market to make ends meet), and perceives as being problematic (e.g., what constitutes sexual harassment or racism).[footnote]See Carnes, White-Collar Government, supra note 197, at 89\u201391.[\/footnote] No amount of data or polling can compensate for the fact that polls are written by the very elites whose world experiences are increasingly insular.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe associational life of partisan elites inevitably affects responsiveness and accountability. The absence of consideration of this phenomenon by responsible party government theorists can probably be attributed to the fact that through the 1950s, elected officials and party leaders had robust ties to their constituents through membership associations based on socioeconomic status (if not race or gender).[footnote]See, e.g., Noah Feldman, Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR\u2019s Great Supreme Court Justices 51\u201359 (2010) (discussing the relationship of the Klan to Southern politics).[\/footnote] Churches, veterans\u2019 groups, and even the Ku Klux Klan in the South were extremely well integrated into the party network.[footnote]See, e.g., id.

This is for two reasons. First, incorporating younger voters and increasing socioeconomic diversity will inevitably increase racial and ethnic diversity in those regions that are diverse. Younger Americans appear to operate in much more diverse social contexts\u2014at least at work\u2014than older Americans. Skocpol &amp; Williamson, supra note 183, at 72\u201373. Second, the goal of racial integration is politically and normatively charged, arguably itself polariz\u00ading. In fact, on one view, the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan of the Donald Trump campaign reflected, at least partially, a nostalgia for a period when there was less racial integration.

It would be better able to disseminate political information during and between elections.\r\n\r\nThe vital link in developing strong parties is the \u201cparty faithful\u201d\u2014defined to include volunteers for campaigns, staff of state and local parties, and activists involved with groups such as Indivisible, the Tea Party, the National Right to Life, or the Sierra Club.[footnote]Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 195.[\/footnote] Such activists are much more likely to be the neighbors of ordinary people.[footnote]Id. at 179, 205 (arguing that \u201cin crucial ways the party faithful are more like ordi\u00adnary voters than party elites\u201d which makes them \u201cuniquely positioned to convey some of the concerns of ordinary voters to party leaders and campaign operatives\u201d).[\/footnote] As a result, they are exceptionally well positioned to mobilize and inform others.[footnote]Regrettably, McKenna and Han do not explore either the effects of the Obama campaign\u2019s community organizing on the knowledge base of contacted Obama voters or whether the activist network it built subsequently influenced the policies of the administra\u00adtion. See McKenna &amp; Han, supra note 144. This gap is typical of the literature, which assumes knowledge precedes participation. For example, the vast literature on the ways that union membership significantly increases political participation, especially for those with the fewest pre-existing resources, such as educational attainment, rarely addresses the political knowledge among such union members separately. See generally Jasmine Kerrissey &amp; Evan Schofer, Union Membership and Political Participation in the United States, 91 Soc. Forces 895 (2013) (examining the effect of union membership on civic and political participation in the late twentieth century in the United States). Similarly, the literature on the effects of face-to-face contact from campaigns for purposes of voter mobilization almost exclusively measures behavior (not knowledge) as the outcome measure. See, e.g., David Broockman &amp; Joshua Kalla, Durably Reducing Transphobia: A Field Experiment on Door-to-Door Canvassing, 352 Science 220, 223\u201324 (2016) (finding signifi\u00adcant and durable persuasive effects from face-to-face canvassing by strangers on attitudes toward transgender individuals).[\/footnote] Even beyond the basic influence of personal ties on recruitment and information transmission, evidence indicates that ordinary citizens have devised their own ways to get \u201c[political] information on the cheap\u201d: They turn to \u201cpolitically knowledgeable individuals\u201d within their social networks\u2014preferably, but <em>not exclusively<\/em>, those \u201cwho hold compatible political biases.\u201d[footnote]Robert Huckfeldt, The Social Communication of Political Expertise, 45 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 425, 426, 437 (2001). Huckfeldt specifically notes that \u201cthe perception of political disagreement produces a relatively minor and inconsequential effect on the perception of expertise\u201d among friends and associates with whom one has in-person conversations. Id. This study was based on a network analysis of a large sample of residents of Indiana and Missouri, and it objectively verified the expertise of alleged experts. Id. at 427\u201328.[\/footnote] The strategy works because people, it turns out, are relatively good judges of actual expertise, and political junkies have a knack for clearly communicating their political knowledge.[footnote]Id. at 436.[\/footnote] Unsurprisingly, individuals are more likely to be drawn into politics if their social networks include persons with political expertise.[footnote]Ronald La Due Lake &amp; Robert Huckfeldt, Social Capital, Social Networks, and Political Participation, 19 Pol.

Rosenblum, On the Side of Angels: An Appreciation of Parties and Partisanship 47 (2008) (observing that one advantage of single-party and anti-pluralist regimes over dynastic or military dictatorships is the party\u2019s ability to function as a channel of communication with party activists, helping party leaders to keep track of the demands of the masses).[\/footnote] And the best evidence of this is the fact that the heyday of membership-based routes to political power was also the New Deal period during which federal policy was significantly more attentive to the needs of middle-class Americans.[footnote]Cf. Bartels, supra note 21, at 12\u201315 &amp; fig.1.4 (arguing that current levels of income inequality rival those of the Roaring Twenties and are the consequence of political choices, and implicitly contrasting the current economic state to the relative income equality during the New Deal period); Skocpol, supra note 186, at 108\u201313 (describing social integration of political figures in the mid-twentieth century).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2. <em>Opportunities and Constraints in the Reshaping of Partisan Networks.\u00a0<\/em>\u2014 Success, unquestionably, depends on diversifying the party faithful.

In this regard, the recent influence of the Koch network and the Tea Party activists with whom it connected is relevant.[footnote]See generally Jane Mayer, Covert Operations: The Billionaire Brothers Who Are Waging a War Against Obama, New Yorker (Aug. 30, 2010), http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/\r\nmagazine\/2010\/08\/30\/covert-operations (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] Scholars of the Koch network are unequivocal that, beyond money, \u201cthe most pervasive and subtle form of leverage by the Koch network on the Republican Party\u201d derived from \u201cthe flow of people back and forth between\u201d Koch-funded organizations and the formal party.[footnote]Theda Skocpol &amp; Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, The Koch Network and Republican Party Extremism, 14 Persp. on Pol. 681, 692 (2016).[\/footnote] Face-to-face social and political networking\u2014from the institution of an annual seminar that brings together millionaires and billionaires, to the cultivation of a network of party professionals and activists sympathetic to their cause\u2014has been the lynchpin for developing party support for their libertarian philosophy.[footnote]Id. at 685\u201392.[\/footnote] It is the absence of a similar social network that has rendered comparable expenditures on the Democratic side less effective.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the Koch strategy testifies to the ways that partisan networks can influence national party platforms, but it does not itself demonstrate the communication of the worldview of ordinary Americans to party leaders.[footnote]Cf.

Certainly, the unelected operatives, whose power is exercised within the formal party, are likely to be wary of broad mobilization. Their power derives from their control over the nomination process, which in turn depends on low voter turnout in low-information primaries.[footnote]Cf. Masket, supra note 38, at 46\u201347 (arguing the informal party organizations that control nominations today, like the party machines of bygone times, depend on low voter turnout during the primary election to consolidate their power because their ability to effectively determine the outcome of the primary depends on predictability).[\/footnote] Ideologi\u00adcal activists, meanwhile, will have their own reasons to resist undertakings that would increase responsiveness to constituents\u2019 interests and preferences.[footnote]Where the electorate is more moderate than the ideological policy demanders, such groups may fear broader mobilization will undercut their policy goals. Perhaps the most salient example is the NRA, whose leadership is known to have much more expansive views of gun rights than either Republicans generally or its own members.

Renewed political engagement combined with heightened levels of concern for the state of our democratic institutions provide a window of opportunity and, as such, an appropriate nudge from the Supreme Court could go a long way toward putting us on a path to a more responsive and accountable political order.\r\n<h3>D. Assessing the Likelihood of Success<\/h3>\r\nThe most important question, of course, is whether an associational focus would work. Given the various dysfunctions of American politics today, what reasons are there to believe that regrounding political elites in the broader electorate while extending representative and informed political participation would, in fact, improve democratic policy responsiveness? Even a sympathetic reader might ask how strengthening the associational life of political parties would make a difference given the incentives that push elected officials to cater to primary voters and wealthy donors in a world of uncompetitive elections. Moreover, assum\u00ading an associational focus could work, shouldn\u2019t we be worried that peer-to-peer engagement will make polarization even worse? The party faithful are known to be ideologically extreme.[footnote]See, e.g., Pew Research Ctr., Partisanship and Political Animosity in 2016, at 14, 34, 44, 53 (2016) [hereinafter Pew Research Ctr., Partisanship and Political Animosity], http:\/\/www.people-press.org\/2016\/06\/22\/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/G9MX-8FYA] (noting high levels of agreement with the positions of their own party and hostility toward members of the other party among respondents who are \u201chighly engaged in politics,\u201d defined as \u201cthose who nearly always vote and have either donated money or volunteered for a campaign in the last year\u201d).[\/footnote] Shouldn\u2019t we, therefore, worry that this approach will exacerbate polarization and further ease the spread of misinformation and damaging populist rhetoric?\r\n\r\nThese are all valid concerns. The relevant question, however, is: How do the potential obstacles to an associational-party path compare with the known ones under responsible party government? By that measure, the associational-party path is a clear winner. Given the failures of responsi\u00adble party government, an associational approach presents the only viable way to induce responsible government. Before making that case, however, it is important to address these challenges on their own terms.\r\n\r\nFirst, how might broadening electoral participation improve demo\u00adcratic responsiveness given that it does not appear to undercut the existing incentives, which uncompetitive elections create, to cater to the preferences of wealthy donors and an ideologically extreme base of the party? It is important, first and foremost, to acknowledge that the relationship between party competition and policy responsiveness is decidedly imperfect. Efforts to increase party competition\u2014including efforts to end partisan gerrymandering\u2014are certainly worthwhile.[footnote]Currently, efforts to expand electoral competition are primarily directed at con\u00advincing the Supreme Court to hold that partisan gerrymanders are both unconstitutional and justiciable. See generally Benisek v. Lamone, 266 F. Supp. 3d 799, 801 (D. Md. 2017), (\u201c[T]he Court now\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [stays] this case pending the outcome of <em>Whitford<\/em>.\u00a0.\u00a0. . [S]uch action is necessary because the justiciability of political gerrymandering claims remains in doubt, but the Supreme Court will likely resolve or clarify this threshold jurisdictional matter in its <em>Whitford<\/em> decision.\u201d), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 543 (2017); Whitford v. Gill, 218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (W.D. Wis. 2016), stay granted, 137 S. Ct. 2289 (June 19, 2017) (staying the judgment of the district court pending resolution of an appeal). Legislative efforts to adopt nonpartisan redistricting commissions are also underway. Such efforts are most likely to succeed in states with direct democratic mechanisms.[\/footnote] Nevertheless, the fact remains that the evidence is decidedly mixed as to whether, let alone how much, party competition improves policy responsiveness.[footnote]See supra notes 98\u201399.[\/footnote] That relationship is even more attenuated when the electorate that actually turns out on election days is increasingly polarized.[footnote]Smidt, supra note 80, at 366 (\u201cPolarization limits the number of floating voters and the electoral payoff of appealing to their moderate or pragmatic concerns.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is equally important to come to terms with the fact that uncompetitive elections are, for the moment, an entrenched feature of the American electoral system. Partisan gerrymanders explain only some of the absence of party competition currently evident.[footnote]See Fred Dews, A Primer on Gerrymandering and Political Polarization, Brookings (July 6, 2017), http:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/brookings-now\/2017\/07\/06\/\r\na-primer-on-gerrymandering-and-political-polarization\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/DLT2-8TVX] (reviewing the debate about the degree to which partisan gerrymandering causes polarization and to which its end would improve electoral competition).[\/footnote] In the main, the lack of party competition is a result of ideological geographic self-sorting rather than partisan gerrymandering.[footnote]See, e.g., Drutman, supra note 7 (\u201cDemocrats and Republicans have more and more become regional parties.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. As a result, a large number of single-member House districts are going to be dominated by one party or the other\u2014no matter how the lines get drawn.\u201d); Salam &amp; Richie, supra note 26 (noting, \u201c[r]egardless of how you slice the map, the majority of Americans will live in so-called landslide districts,\u201d meaning voters who \u201cdefy stereotypes of left and right\u201d are often \u201clocked out of representation\u201d).[\/footnote] Even if the Supreme Court puts an end to partisan gerrymandering, only a limited\u2014albeit extremely important\u2014set of swing districts would be affected.[footnote]See Laura Royden &amp; Michael Li, Brennan Ctr. for Justice, Extreme Maps 1\u20132 (2017), http:\/\/www.brennancenter.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/Extreme%20Map\r\ns%205.16_0.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6C5U-ZMSJ] (identifying seven extremely gerry\u00admandered states, including swing states such as Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia); Dews, supra note 252 (endorsing the assessment that \u201cthe clustering of Americans into like-minded communities\u201d limits the likelihood that ending partisan gerrymandering will significantly increase the number of competitive legislative districts).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, while we must fight fading party competition, it is time to devise strategies to address policy responsiveness in the absence of party competition. The associational-party path\u2019s emphasis on expanding the electorate seeks to do just that. By focusing on drawing in more voters and creating a more representative electorate, it points to opportunities to radically shift electoral expectations.[footnote]Most recently, this phenomenon was seen in the Democrat Doug Jones\u2019s special-election win in solidly Republican Alabama, which was attributed to unprecedented black turnout, driven, at least in part, by civic groups within the partisan network. As reported by journalist Al Giordano on Twitter, the success was in large part the result of old-fashioned grassroots mobilization efforts by the Democratic Party and its civil-society allies. For exam\u00adple, \u201c[t]he state NAACP instructed its local branches to call every registered voter in the state who did not vote in 2016.\u201d Al Giordano (@AlGiordano), Twitter (Dec. 12, 2017), http:\/\/twitter.com\/algiordano\/status\/940657230499733504 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/B427-KGXT].

Arguably, Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign operated similarly, redefining which states were swing states partly by changing the electorate. See William H. Frey, Population Studies Ctr., Report No. 09-688, How Did Race Affect the 2008 Presidential Election? 4 (2009), http:\/\/www.psc.isr.umich.edu\/pubs\/pdf\/rr09-688.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/2QM6-4QGG] (showing \u201chow the changing racial composition and voting of minorities and whites affected the 2008 results\u201d in several states, including Virginia, North Carolina, Nevada, and New Mexico, which swung to the Democrats for the first time in several elections).[\/footnote] In particular, it creates the opportunity to use strong associational parties to significantly increase turnout during party primaries, thereby undercutting the current hold that primary voters have on the system.[footnote]The gap between the actual electorate and the eligible electorate is quite signifi\u00adcant. See, e.g., Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1162\u201370, 1175\u201383 (providing charts of turnout in both primary and general elections and describ\u00ading strategies for making primary turnout more akin to turnout in the general election as a way to overcome the incentives created by party primaries in uncompetitive districts).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTurning now to the second concern: Wouldn\u2019t a peer-to-peer engage\u00adment strategy that depends on the party faithful inadvertently exacerbate legislative gridlock by increasing polarization? In this regard, it is important to state clearly the ways in which this project is driven by different concerns than party reforms primarily targeted at addressing polarization. This project is driven by the evidence that American democracy is suffering from a crisis of representation. If the broader citizenry is genuinely polarized\u2014a question that remains decidedly open\u2014legislative polarization would be representative democracy at work.[footnote]A continuing area of dispute is polarization\u2019s reach among the general electorate. Partisan polarization is certainly increasing and the parties appear to be increasingly draw\u00ading support from starkly different demographic groups. See generally Pew Research Ctr., The Parties on the Eve of the 2016 Election: Two Coalitions, Moving Further Apart 1 (2016), http:\/\/assets.pewresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2016\/09\/09-13-2016-Party-ID-release-final.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/2DTD-3NG8] (finding the two parties increas\u00adingly differ in terms of race, religion, ethnicity, and educational attainment); Pew Research Ctr., The Partisan Divide on Political Values Grows Even Wider (2017) [hereinafter Pew Research Ctr., The Partisan Divide], http:\/\/assets.pewresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\r\nsites\/5\/2017\/10\/05162647\/10-05-2017-Political-landscape-release.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\nEE6Q-BAQC] (summarizing survey results showing increased polariza\u00adtion of the electorate). Yet, many continue to argue that most Americans remain relatively moderate in their policy preferences. These scholars emphasize that polarization remains most extreme among those who are most politically engaged.

See, e.g., Masket, supra note 38, at 24\u201325 (noting a \u201cvirtual consensus\u201d that candidates today \u201crepresent[] the ideologically extreme elements within their parties\u201d rather than the preferences of their constituents); David W.

On this front, the trepidation appears to be driven by a fear that peer-to-peer strategies dependent on the party faithful (known to be more ideologically extreme) would polarize those with whom they come into contact.\r\n\r\nIn fact, however, there is reason to have confidence that an associational-party path would mitigate rather than exacerbate polariza\u00adtion. Much of the polarization research focuses on the political effects of partisan media and its dissemination online.[footnote]See Matthew S. Levendusky, Why Do Partisan Media Polarize Viewers?, 57 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 611, 612\u2013619 (2013) (finding, based on a review of the literature and a series of experiments, that partisan media does not polarize moderates and concluding they, instead, take \u201cpeople who are already somewhat extreme and makes them <em>even more extreme<\/em>\u201d).[\/footnote] But there is little reason to expect the dynamics of social media to permeate old-fashioned face-to-face retail politics. People act differently in person than online.[footnote]See generally Danielle Keats Citron, Hate Crimes in Cyberspace 57, 62 (2014) (touting the Internet\u2019s many civic virtues, including politically connecting individuals, while noting that \u201c[s]ome of the Internet\u2019s key features\u2014anonymity, mobilization of groups, and group polarization\u2014make it more likely that people will act destructively,\u201d including fueling, in certain contexts, \u201castronomical growth\u201d in extremist hate groups).[\/footnote] For a variety of psychological reasons (especially anonymity), it appears to be much easier to engage in asocial behaviors online than in person\u2014to be more confrontational, to express more extreme views, and to lie or misrepresent oneself.[footnote]See John Suler, The Online Disinhibition Effect, 7 CyberPsychol. &amp; Behav. 321, 322 (2004) (attributing this effect to, inter alia, anonymity and invisibility); see also Jacob Groshek &amp; Chelsea Cutino, Meaner on Mobile: Incivility and Impoliteness in Communicating Contentious Politics on Sociotechnical Networks, 2 Soc.

Santana, Virtuous or Vitriolic: The Effect of Anonymity on Civility in Online Newspaper Reader Comment Boards, 8 Journalism Prac. 18, 26\u201329 (2014) (finding anonymous commenters were noticeably more uncivil). For a short review of the debate, see Maria Konnikova, The Psychology of Online Comments, New Yorker (Oct. 23, 2013), http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/tech\/elements\/the-psychology-of-online-comments [http:\/\/perma.cc\/EF69-6X5T] (opposing, however, the decision to ban online comments and discussing ways that they can be structured to invite the imposition of civility).[\/footnote] By contrast, there is a strong incentive when interacting in person to be prosocial\u2014to cooperate and avoid conflict, sometimes to a fault\u2014especially with individuals with whom one has a prior relationship.[footnote]Cf. Brady et al., Prospecting for Participants, supra note 165, at 159\u201361 (confirm\u00ading the hypothesis that \u201crelationships [of various kinds] have the potential for giving a target added incentive to comply\u201d with requests to participate because \u201cwe ordinarily seek not to offend those to whom we are close\u201d); Broockman &amp; Kalla, supra note 209, at 223 (finding face-to-face conversations with individuals had persistent effects on attitudes toward transgender individuals, whereas surveys did not).[\/footnote] Certainly, the social-capital literature suggests that knitting together the polity and encouraging civic engagement is less likely to draw out the dark and dysfunctional elements of our politics.[footnote]The central claim of the social-capital literature is that face-to-face association in small and intimate groups\u2014neighborhood associations, bowling leagues, and clubs\u2014instills cooperative virtues, such as cooperation, reciprocity, and trust. See generally Nancy L. Rosenblum, Membership and Morals: The Personal Uses of Pluralism in America 29\u201341 (1998) (reviewing the social-capital literature in anticipation of criticizing it for failing to explain how the cultivation of social capital within face-to-face communities necessarily translates beyond that social context).[\/footnote] To the degree that an associational-party path envisions peer-to-peer mobilization online, it is primarily focused on situations where the con\u00adnection between those individuals also has a face-to-face manifestation\u2014such as the efforts of the Obama campaign. Particularly in that context, it seems just as plausible that the effect might run the other way: Contact with less ideologically extreme neighbors and associates might create a reality check for the most ideologically extreme because personal connection between peers might mitigate the inclination to simply reinforce one\u2019s beliefs.[footnote]Cf. Levendusky, supra note 262, at 617\u201319 (concluding, based on a series of experiments, that partisan media does not polarize moderates and finding it, instead, takes \u201cpeople who are already somewhat extreme and makes them <em>even more extreme<\/em>\u201d because of a natural tendency to wish to reinforce one\u2019s predispositions).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, this is an institutional-design project the primary goal of which is to ensure the openness of the channels of democratic politics, including parties, rather than a particular substantive outcome: If polarization is the outcome of broadening the electorate and enhancing its access to information, then so be it. The same is true if it turns out that the nation truly is racist, misogynist, prone to believe falsehoods, and enamored of hypercapitalism.[footnote]It is also, of course, possible that polarization is a phenomenon that cannot be contained and will keep increasing regardless of either campaign finance or mobilization efforts. See, e.g., Heather K. Gerken, Playing Cards in a Hurricane: Party Reform in an Age of Polarization, 54 Hous. L. Rev. 911, 914\u201317 (2017) (\u201c[T]he real question we should be asking is not <em>how<\/em> to reduce polarization but <em>whether<\/em> we can.\u201d). As to the spread of fake news, it is not at all clear how reforms in the vein of responsible party government would better address the fake-news phenomenon, nor is it at all clear that our Constitution per\u00admits efforts to regulate, even define, what is fake news.[\/footnote] At the moment, however, institutional features of contemporary democracy are driving those politi\u00adcal trends.[footnote]See Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 329\u201333; see also Brady et al., Primary Elections, supra note 258, at 98\u201399 (finding that \u201ccandidates who do not appeal to an ideological base of organized voters are more likely to lose in the primaries\u201d and arguing that is an important explanation of party polarization in Congress).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that, notwithstanding the reasonableness of these various concerns, an associational-party approach is the only viable reform agenda. Responsible party government is not working.[footnote]See supra section I.B.[\/footnote] The political parties have not been sufficiently responsive to the electorate, and voters appear increasingly dissatisfied with the brands that are on offer.[footnote]See supra notes 80\u201384 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Nor is the most salient current party-reform agenda, which seeks to strengthen the power of party leaders by loosening or abolishing contribution limits to political parties\u2014either as a matter of statutory or (far worse) constitutional law\u2014significantly more promising.[footnote]See, e.g., La Raja &amp; Rauch, supra note 5, at 10\u201312; Issacharoff, Outsourcing Politics, supra note 4, at 865\u201370; La Raja, supra note 5, at 313\u201315.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nProponents of strengthening party leaders through deregulation argue that raising or removing contribution limits to the official political party will shore up party elites by leveling the playing field with so-called outside groups, such as Super PACs. This will, in turn, undercut the power of the more ideologically extreme elements of the partisan network, reduce polarization, and end legislative gridlock.[footnote]See, e.g., Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 845.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUntamed deregulatory efforts, however, could push the formal politi\u00adcal parties further to the ideological extremes just as easily as they could bring forth moderate parties inclined to legislative compromise.[footnote]See Michael J.

Conferring total control over the party brand to party leadership in the belief that electoral competition will force officials to tack back to the median voter\u2019s preferences certainly will not work absent electoral competition. But it may not work even where competition exists. Party competition, as noted previously, is a decidedly imperfect mechanism for producing policy responsiveness.[footnote]See supra notes 98\u201399 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEven putting to one side problems associated with party competition and its absence, it is not at all clear that leveling the playing field will redirect the flow back to the formal party and its leaders: Donors make campaign contributions to different entities depending on their inter\u00adests.[footnote]Samuel Issacharoff &amp; Jeremy Peterman, Special Interests After <em>Citizens United<\/em>: Access, Replacement, and Interest Group Response to Legal Change, 9 Ann. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Sci. 185, 187, 194\u201395 (2013).[\/footnote] Ideological donors may well continue to donate to ideological groups; moreover, even if they were to decide to fund the political parties, their demands for ideologically pure candidates are unlikely to disappear.[footnote]See Bauer, The Parties\u2019 Struggles, supra note 6, at 889; Gerken, supra note 268, at 917\u201319.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, unbridled deregulation of party funding is likely to strengthen the hands of wealthy donors.[footnote]Gerken, supra note 268, at 919.[\/footnote] In 2014, following <em>McCutcheon<\/em>, Congress substantially lifted contribution limits for three main areas of party expenditures: presidential nominating conventions, expenses associated with the construction and renovation of party headquarters, and litigation expenses associated with recounts and other election-related legal proceedings.[footnote]See 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030116(a)(9) (2012); see also Athena Jones, Lawmakers Chip Away at Campaign Finance Rules in Spending Bill, CNN Politics (Dec. 10, 2014), http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/12\/10\/politics\/spending-bill-campaign-donations\/index.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/9XZY-JLWN].[\/footnote] It is difficult to see how creating these kinds of party slush funds breeds accountability to the electorate.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7; see also Schmitt, supra note 4.[\/footnote] As Lee Drutman argues, deregulating to \u201callow[] party insiders to control larger pots of money\u201d may well improve party discipline, but it is not at all clear why it would make them more attentive to the interests of constituents rather than the (largely out-of-precinct) donors from whom the money arrives.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7 (noting further that even when political party leaders have the funds, they do not spend them in primaries on moderate candidates).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the associational-party path is theoretically optimal as a guide to structuring First Amendment doctrine and as a measure for regulatory reforms\u2014even as it does not guarantee a cure to all our democratic ills. A party-reform agenda tailored to strengthening the associational life of political parties, including by redirecting the flow of money, is significantly less prone to these problems than one singularly focused on strengthening the political power of party leaders.\r\n\r\nThe central premise underlying an associational-party path is that curtailing the political influence of donors and other unrepresentative policy demanders requires creating a counterpoint to that influence by empowering and mobilizing millions of ordinary Americans through civic and political organizations.[footnote]Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1143\u201351 (argu\u00ading this approach is necessary because in a capitalist economy, in which wealth is not equally distributed, the wealthy benefit disproportionately from basic First Amendment guarantees, with respect to election-related spending, issue advocacy, lobbying, and fund\u00ading citizens\u2019 knowledge base); see also Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Key Findings: The Inevitable Limits of Campaign Finance Reform, Scholars Strategy Network (Sept. 2016), http:\/\/www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org\/brief\/inevitable-limits-campaign-finance-reform [http:\/\/perma.cc\/GE5X-YW4K] (providing a concise summary of the argument in <em>Beyond Campaign Finance Reform<\/em>).[\/footnote] Any deregulation of party financing must, therefore, be narrowly tailored to the goal of encouraging peer-to-peer party-building and voter-mobilization strategies that significantly rely on face-to-face interactions.\r\n\r\nFrom an associational perspective, in other words, the pertinent question for any deregulatory proposal ought to be where within the party the money is likely to flow. This is because responsive governance is most likely to arise out of a party capable of engaging a representative electorate in a peer-to-peer fashion through personal appeals by party activists and individuals in community-based civic associations. The impact of deregulation will be vastly different if it flows to political parties engaged in orchestrating volunteers and peer-to-peer mobilization rather than buying TV advertisements that seek to influence likely voters or paying for lavish party headquarters.[footnote]Similarly, from the perspective of an associational path to responsive party government, current efforts to increase small donors, such as matching programs, are too blunt. Efforts to enhance the amount of money small donors contribute online are useful to the degree that they free legislators\u2019 time to legislate and to spend more time with their constituents. But this solution is no magic bullet: Simply increasing the number of online contributions to campaigns from small donors through matching programs will not in and of itself empower those donors. To achieve that end, small-donor programs would also have to create incentives for legislators to give small donors opportunities for access simi\u00adlar to those big donors receive today. That is, they would need to be specifically structured to encourage elected officials and partisan elites to provide face-to-face access for small donors or to strengthen the power of existing membership-based political and civic organizations.[\/footnote] Even directing more money to state and local parties will not necessarily facilitate the development of \u201csocial capital by building connections, trust, and cooperation across diverse individuals and groups.\u201d[footnote]La Raja &amp; Rauch, supra note 5, at 5. None of the reforms that La Raja and Rauch propose explicitly address the sort of peer-to-peer strategies that are likely to increase social capital.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe associational-party path is preferable to other proposals for one final reason: Unlike responsible party government, it eschews the assumption that party reform alone can bear the entire weight of solving our democratic dysfunctions. Entrenched problems demand multifac\u00adeted interventions aimed at incremental change. Party reform can only ever be a partial solution. To the degree responsible party government suggested otherwise, it was obviously mistaken.\r\n\r\nReforms to address the associational qualities of the traditional party are most likely to succeed as part of a package of reforms aimed to empower ordinary Americans in politics by responding to broader transformations in civil society.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1154\u201362, 1184\u201385 (documenting how \u201c[t]he chain of political accountability has\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. been weakened by the transformation of civic associations\u201d and arguing that campaign finance reformers need to turn their attention to legal strategies for empowering ordinary Americans in politics).[\/footnote] While the traditional party is arguably the least well situated to translate peer-to-peer strategies into a two-way street of communication given the cyclical nature of elections, the payoff of pursuing democratic accountability by promoting both electoral associations <em>and<\/em> civic associations derives from a central and recurring finding from the empirical research: Political experiences tend to produce additional and deeper civic and political engagement.[footnote]Abu El-Haj, Friends, Associates, and Associations, supra note 32, at 81\u201382 (noting \u201cempirical research indicates that civic participation breeds more participation\u201d and that \u201c[i]nitial forays into public life quickly turn into a habit, as individuals become part of social networks likely to encourage it\u201d).[\/footnote] Simply put, efforts to broaden electoral participation through peer-to-peer engagement, particularly when face-to-face, are likely to lead individuals into additional forms of political participation and organizational mem\u00adbership, thereby reinforcing efforts to stimulate a more representative and membership-based array of civic associations\u2014the kind most capable of breeding informed political participation.[footnote]Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1157\u201358 (noting \u201cthe critical feature missing in the vast majority of civic associations today is active mem\u00adbership and class-integrated, personal ties\u201d and concluding strong civic associations with active memberships have the unique \u201cability\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to generate political activity, including voting, and to effectively disseminate relevant political information to ordinary Americans\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPut differently, as the sociological definition of the party highlights, the formal party\u2014that is, the traditional focus of party reform\u2014is merely one type of node within the partisan network.[footnote]See supra notes 136\u2013144 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] In addition to candi\u00addates and formal party entities (governance and election-related entities), there are PACs of various sorts (primarily election-related entities) as well as\u2014and this is what the traditional account fails to notice\u2014certain civic associations (policy demanders that engage in electoral politics when it serves their interests). Efforts to increase responsive and accountable governance must seek improvements in all three arenas.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, given the failures of responsible party government, the associational-party path, on balance, offers the most viable route to inducing political parties and their elected officials to govern responsibly and responsively. Having outlined the assumptions and contours of an associational-party path, this Essay will next consider the implications for First Amendment doctrine.\r\n<h2>III. Reconceiving First Amendment Burdens<\/h2>\r\nWhile it is obviously possible to reshape the associational texture of partisan networks by shifting the regulatory framework to empower different legal entities within the partisan network, this Essay focuses on constitutional doctrine.[footnote]The author plans to consider the regulatory implications of an associational-party path in future work.[\/footnote] Many regulatory debates are best left to the democratic process, but the regulation of the democratic process is not one of them.[footnote]See Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Wholly Native to the First Amendment: The Positive Liberty of Self-Government, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. Online 241, 243\u201344 (2016), http:\/\/\r\nwww.pennlawreview.com\/online\/164-U-Pa-L-Rev-Online-241.pdf (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (\u201cA default rule of deference to legislatures with respect to the basic rules of democracy\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. requires a willful blindness to the realities of the rough and tumble of politics and the powerful incentives to entrenchment.\u201d).[\/footnote] The incentives of elected officials are too compromised to devise regulatory regimes that will induce political accountability.[footnote]See supra notes 48\u201354 and accompanying text (noting that a \u201ccentral preoccupa\u00adtion among scholars of American democracy\u201d is the fact that political parties are inevitably primarily interested in aggrandizing power); see also Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Changing the People: Legal Regulation and American Democracy, 86 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1, 6 (2011) (noting a central premise of the field of law of democracy is the recognition that \u201c[l]egislators\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. are problematic regulators when it comes to the rules governing elections because they are self-interested and are regularly tempted to use legal rules to entrench themselves\u201d).[\/footnote] It is, therefore, incumbent on First Amendment doctrine to allocate rights in ways that encourage democratic accountability and political responsiveness.\r\n\r\nToward this end, this Part identifies opportunities within existing First Amendment doctrine to strategically underwrite the strength of those segments of the partisan network that enhance opportunities for social contact between party elites and the broader electorate. The doctrinal proposal, set forth below, essentially entails two steps. The first would extend the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to all manner of political party regulations, including those that burden the First Amendment rights of the two major political parties. The second step would recalibrate the burdens analysis to focus on impediments to the party\u2019s ability to mobilize broad and representative political participation\u2014as opposed to those placed on access to the polls or the ballot, as in the typical case.\r\n<h3>A. Assessing Regulatory Burdens Within the Anderson\u2013Burdick Framework<\/h3>\r\nThere is no question that the First Amendment rights of formal political parties can shape the associational attributes of partisan networks. When a political party is forced to hold an open primary, for example, its partisan network is diversified. When it is prevented from holding open primaries, the power of party activists is heightened. An associational path to responsive party government suggests that First Amendment rights should be allocated in ways that prevent regulation from undermining either the socioeconomic and intergenerational breadth or the interpersonal depth of partisan networks.[footnote]For First Amendment purposes, the political party refers to the formal party; other nodes of the partisan network may have their own First Amendment rights.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe principal mistake of current doctrine is its preoccupation with protecting political parties, <em>as speakers<\/em>, from burdens placed on their brand.[footnote]See, e.g., McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 352 (2003) (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (explaining \u201cthe national political parties are exemplars of political speech,\u201d \u201cpromote coordinated political messages,\u201d and exist often \u201cprimarily for the purpose of expressing ideas and generating debate\u201d), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] Compounding this error is the fact that the members of the <em>Citizens United<\/em> majority appear to assume that any regulatory burden placed on a political party as a speaker demands strict scrutiny.[footnote]See Republican Party of La. v. FEC, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86, 94\u201395 (D.D.C. 2016) (recounting uncertainty with respect to the level of scrutiny in light of cases such as <em>McCutcheon v. FEC<\/em>), summarily aff\u2019d, 137 S. Ct. 2178 (2017).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFrom an associational-party perspective, not every restriction on a political party\u2019s freedom of speech and association \u201cis of constitutional dimension\u201d\u2014a point the Court has itself acknowledged at times.[footnote]<em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 99; see also FEC v. Colo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. (<em>Colorado Republican II<\/em>), 533 U.S. 431, 450 n.11 (2001) (making a similar argument when the party asserted only speech interests).[\/footnote] The primary concern is burdens placed on the party\u2019s ability to foster deep and wide social ties to a representative electorate. Burdens on the clarity of a party\u2019s message, by comparison, are much less important.\r\n\r\nExtending the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to the two major political parties would provide a relatively simple way to incorporate an associational-party perspective into existing First Amendment doctrine.[footnote]See generally Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433\u201343 (1992) (laying out the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework).[\/footnote] Developed in the context of restrictions on access to the ballot, the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework is particularly well suited to the task because it explicitly foregrounds analysis of the burdens, reserving strict scrutiny for cases in which the burdens are severe.[footnote]Id. at 433\u201343 (permitting some burdens to be placed on the right to vote in light of a recognition that elections must be regulated to ensure fairness and accuracy of the count).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAn associational-party perspective provides a new scale with which to weigh the burdens on a party\u2019s First Amendment rights in which the focus would turn to burdens placed on parties as associations and their capacity to foster deep and wide social ties to a representative electorate. A few lower courts have already taken this step, attending, in the context of challenges brought by minor parties, to the nature of the burdens placed on the party\u2019s ability to cultivate and maintain ties to the electorate.[footnote]See, e.g., Green Party of N.Y. State v. N.Y. State Bd. of Elections, 389 F.3d 411, 416, 420\u201321 (2d Cir. 2004) (striking down a New York statute that required state officials to \u201cerase the enrollment information\u201d of any member of a political party that has lost its recognition and \u201cchange the status of that individual to non-affiliated on the registration poll record\u201d); see also Baer v. Meyer, 728 F.2d 471, 473\u201374 (10th Cir. 1984) (striking down a Colorado law that \u201cunreasonably burdened the ability of [voters] to note their support of the Citizens and Libertarian parties on their voter registration forms\u201d); Council of Alt. Political Parties v. State Div. of Elections, 781 A.2d 1041, 1047, 1051\u201352 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001) (noting the \u201cvoter affiliation declaration scheme\u201d at issue \u201cimposes a considerable, albeit not severe, burden on plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights to express political ideas and to associate to exchange these ideas to further their political goals\u201d).[\/footnote] In one case, plaintiffs challenged a state law that required election officials to scrub voter rolls of affiliations with third parties that no longer met the state\u2019s legal definition of a political party.[footnote]See, e.g., <em>Green Party<\/em>, 389 F.3d at 416.[\/footnote] In applying the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> test, the court explained that the burden was severe, insofar as it undermined the party\u2019s ability to identify and mobilize potential voters or engage in \u201cparty building activities.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 420\u201321.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCurrently, while the Supreme Court consistently applies the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework when adjudicating both challenges brought by minor parties and intraparty feuds involving the right to participate,[footnote]See N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, 201\u201302 (2008) (involving an intraparty fight over judicial nominations); Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U.S. 581, 584, 599 (2005) (involving a challenge by the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma to the state\u2019s semiclosed primary); Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 353\u201354 (1997) (involving a minor party\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of Minnesota\u2019s antifusion law).[\/footnote] its practice has been inconsistent in cases involving the direct regulation of the two major political parties. When First Amendment challenges have been brought by the leaders of a major political party, the tendency has been to simply apply strict scrutiny.[footnote]See Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 572, 582 (2000) (citing <em>Burdick v. Takushi<\/em> but failing to recite or explicitly apply its test before concluding strict scrutiny was warranted).[\/footnote] The only outlier was the recent case of <em>Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party.<\/em>[footnote]Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 451\u201352 (2008) (\u201cIf a statute imposes only modest burdens, however, then \u2018the State\u2019s important regula\u00adtory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\u2019 on election procedures.\u201d (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983))).[\/footnote] The <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework has never been mentioned in cases challenging restrictions on the financing of political parties, even by Justices reluctant to submit to <em>Buckley v. Valeo<\/em>\u2019s distinction between contributions and expenditures.[footnote]This is evident if one keycites <em>Burdick<\/em> in Westlaw. See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25, 44\u201345 (1976); see also infra notes 323\u2013328 (explaining <em>Buckley<\/em>\u2019s doctrinal framework as well as Justice Kennedy\u2019s refusal to apply it in certain cases).[\/footnote] Moreover, even in those minor-party cases where it has applied the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> test, the Court has sidelined separate analyses of the impact of various ballot-access rules on those parties\u2019 associational life.[footnote]<em>Clingman<\/em>, 544 U.S. at 591\u201393 (noting that \u201c<em>Tashjian<\/em> applied strict scrutiny with little discussion of the magnitude of the burdens imposed by Connecticut\u2019s closed primary on parties\u2019 and voters\u2019 associational rights\u201d and dismissing the burdens placed by the chal\u00adlenged law on the minor party\u2019s associational rights as minimal); <em>Timmons<\/em>, 520 U.S. at 359\u201364 (\u201c[T]he burdens Minnesota imposes on the party\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment associational rights\u2014though not trivial\u2014are not severe.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe extension of the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework to assess the First Amendment implications of all facets of political party regulation\u2014by establishing a jurisprudence that is sensitive to regulatory burdens that further undermine the existing associational life of political parties\u2014would enable the Court to adjudicate the First Amendment burdens placed on political parties in ways that will encourage broader demo\u00adcratic goals. It would also have the added benefit of affording political parties robust First Amendment protection without constitutionalizing an unbounded right to accept unlimited contributions.[footnote]As discussed above, the most aggressive version of the party-reform agenda, in the vein of responsible party government, seeks to achieve its end as a matter of constitutional dictate.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. Illustrating the New Approach in the Context of the Soft-Money Ban<\/h3>\r\nTo illustrate the implications of this doctrinal and analytic shift, con\u00adsider the controversy over the constitutionality of the 2002 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which closed the so-called soft-money loophole. In the 1990s, the national party committees regularly exploited the fact that federal law, at the time, exempted the financing of state and local elections as well as generic party-building activities from its regulatory purview.[footnote]See Shays v. FEC, 528 F.3d 914, 917\u201318 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (describing, concisely, the implications of the loophole).[\/footnote] Through this loophole, national party leaders solicited unlimited contributions (soft money), ostensibly earmarked for state or local elections, from big donors with promises of access to federal candidates and elected officials.[footnote]McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 122, 146\u201347 (2003) (defining soft money as money raised outside federal contribution limits by national party committees, often at the behest of candidates, ostensibly to cover expenses related to state and local elections, although intentionally spent in ways that benefited federal candidates), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] Those funds were then funneled to activities that, while formally related to state and local elections, directly benefited the federal candidates who appeared on the same ballot\u2014for example, sham issue advertisements (the bulk of the spending), voter-registration drives, and get-out-the-vote efforts.[footnote]<em>Shays<\/em>, 528 F.3d at 916 (\u201c\u2018[I]ssue ads\u2019 purportedly aimed at influencing people\u2019s policy views but actually [were] directed at swaying their views of [federal] candidates.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the use of the so-called soft-money loophole to circumvent FECA\u2019s contribution limits eventually raised concerns about the sort of solicitude donors were receiving from federal candidates and political parties. In response, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), which embraced a multipronged strategy for closing the soft-money loophole.[footnote]Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Pub. L.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25, 44\u201345 (1976).[\/footnote] The dissenters, however, were not persuaded.[footnote]See <em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 286\u201387, 308\u201314 (Kennedy, J., dissenting in part).[\/footnote] Justice Kennedy, in particular, advocated for the application of strict scrutiny on the grounds that the soft-money ban was neither a contribution nor an expenditure limit, but both at once and, as such, \u201cfundamentally alter[ed], and thereby burden[ed], protected speech and association throughout our society.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 314.[\/footnote] Given the absence of a compelling state interest, he maintained the provisions were unconstitutional.[footnote]See id. Justice Kennedy further argued that soft-money expenditures undertaken independently of candidates, by definition, \u201clack[] a possibility for <em>quid pro quo<\/em> corruption of federal officeholders.\u201d Id. at 301.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile the contribution\u2013expenditure distinction is a conceptual quagmire, Justice Kennedy\u2019s alternative\u2014strict scrutiny for any party regulation arguably involving speech\u2014is no better. The former framework assumes that contribution limits are virtually never constitutionally problematic in the name of a pragmatic compromise. The latter amounts to the rote application of strict scrutiny, thereby granting political parties an effectively unlimited First Amendment right to accept campaign contributions.[footnote]Presumably, the theory is as follows: Since money is speech and a political party is a speaker, any restriction on the money that a political party has at its disposal during an electoral campaign amounts to an unconstitutional burden on its freedom of speech in the absence of a compelling state interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. See, e.g., id. at 319, 321.[\/footnote] Neither approach attempts to consider the underlying First Amendment interests before assessing whether the campaign finance burden is of constitutional dimension.[footnote]Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433\u201334 (1992) (describing the differing stan\u00addards the Court applies to \u201csevere\u201d versus \u201creasonable\u201d restrictions on First and Fourteenth Amendment voting rights).[\/footnote] Both completely neglect the ends to which First Amendment rights ought to be granted.\r\n\r\nThe <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework, by contrast, is already sensitive to determining which burdens placed on political parties are of constitutional dimension.[footnote]See id.[\/footnote] The test explicitly foregrounds analysis of these burdens, reserving strict scrutiny for cases in which they are severe, in recognition of the fact that the legitimacy of elections frequently depends on their regulation. Extending the framework\u2014from the current doctrine, in which it applies to cases involving burdens on the right to participate and those involving minor parties, to cases involving the two major political parties\u2014provides a unique opportunity to develop a theoretically sound doctrine capable of allocating First Amendment rights to political parties in ways that facilitate the goals of democratic accountability and responsiveness.\r\n\r\nTo further the associational path to party responsiveness, however, it is necessary to establish a new measure for how to weigh those burdens.[footnote]One could, of course, extend the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to cases involving the major political parties but remain faithful to responsible party government by focusing on burdens placed on the party leaders\u2019 ability to speak clearly. While this would be better than rote application of strict scrutiny to any regulation placed on the major political par\u00adties, the associational-party path rejects this approach insofar as it would not strengthen the associational life of political parties.[\/footnote] The critical questions would become: first, whether the regulation decreases a party\u2019s ability to mobilize political participation and facilitate information transmission through peer-to-peer appeals by party activists; and second, whether it otherwise undermines the party\u2019s organizational stability and coalition-building capacity. The former burdens are worrisome not only because personalized solicitations are particularly effective means for facilitating electoral participation but also because genuine points of contact with the electorate are more likely to ground elected officials in the experiences of their constituents.[footnote]See supra sections II.B\u2013.C.[\/footnote] The latter burdens are worrisome to the degree that the need to rebuild organizational capacity each cycle detracts from the ability to sustain political engagement over the long term. The extension would have the added payoff of bringing coherence to the doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn the context of BCRA\u2019s soft-money ban, shifting to the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> test demands a separate analysis for each of the three types of party expenditures implicated: (1) voter-identification, -registration, and get-out-the-vote initiatives; (2) state and local party staff; and (3) issue advocacy. Ultimately, the recalibrated <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>test points to a middle-ground position, in which some, but not all, aspects of the soft-money ban would be held unconstitutional. When the question of whether a burden should be deemed severe turns on how it impacts the party\u2019s ability to foster broad social networks with interpersonal depth, it is the first two limitations on expenditures that pose the most severe burdens. This section addresses each provision in turn.\r\n\r\nThe congressional choice to define \u201cFederal election activity\u201d to include voter-registration, -identification, and -mobilization drives under\u00adtaken within 120 days of a federal election, thereby requiring that such activities be undertaken with hard money, burdens core First Amendment interests. Face-to-face appeals are incredibly effective for fostering short- and long-term political participation, as we have seen, but are also extremely costly.[footnote]Donald P. Green &amp; Alan S. Gerber, Get Out the Vote: How to Increase Voter Turnout 10, 13, 34\u201340, 77\u201379, 94\u201395 (2004) (comparing the effectiveness and cost of different get-out-the-vote strategies and arguing that door-to-door, in-person canvassing, even by paid workers, is the \u201cgold-standard mobilization tactic\u201d); Bauer, The Right to \u201cDo Politics,\u201d supra note 30, at 77\u201378 (discussing the costs of association building).[\/footnote] When party resources are limited, it is reasonable to expect parties to choose cheaper forms of mobilization, such as impersonal mass communication. In fact, campaigns frequently devote far fewer resources to such efforts, despite their broader demo\u00adcratic returns.[footnote]See, e.g., Steve Phillips, Opinion, How Democrats Should Spend Their Millions, N.Y. Times (Apr. 17, 2017), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/04\/17\/opinion\/how-democrats-should-spend-their-millions.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (criticizing Jon Ossoff\u2019s campaign for spending around 80% of its $6 million on advertis\u00ading rather than a face-to-face turnout operation); Steve Phillips, Opinion, How to Build a Democratic Majority that Lasts, N.Y. Times (Oct. 5, 2016), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/10\/05\/\r\nopinion\/campaign-stops\/how-to-build-a-democratic-majority-that-lasts.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (praising Representative Keith Ellison for \u201cconsistently increas[ing] voter turnout in his congres\u00adsional district\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. by focusing on personal contact\u201d rather than devoting millions to \u201c[p]aid ads [that] do little to change voter behavior\u201d).[\/footnote] In 2008, for example, nearly 60% of the presidential campaign budgets on both sides were spent on advertising.[footnote]McKenna &amp; Han, supra note 144, at 32.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo the degree that it implicates the peer-to-peer efforts at political engagement that are most likely to be undertaken face-to-face, while undermining incentives for candidates to coordinate with state and local parties in that effort, BCRA\u2019s requirement that mobilization be done with hard money warrants strict scrutiny under the revised <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> test. The central problem is that this aspect of BCRA limits the money available for the most promising path to deepening and broadening political participation and responsive party government. The very requirement that such activities may only be undertaken with hard money and Levin funds, where applicable, in the ordinary case will limit the amount of mobilization undertaken.\r\n\r\nCertainly, campaigns that have specific strategic reasons to devote resources to their ground game will find ways to fund it using a combination of hard and soft money. The Obama campaigns, for instance, orchestrated a significant ground game in both 2008 and 2012 while operating under BCRA.[footnote]That said, BCRA may still have impacted Obama\u2019s strategy (at least in 2012 when he was no longer an outsider) to the degree the campaign often sidestepped state and local parties. Professor Issacharoff has recounted the following regarding his experience as a senior legal advisor to Obama for America in 2012:\r\n\r\nWith the benefits of Obama\u2019s incumbency\u00a0. . . I had expected that the 2012 campaign would be largely organized around the state political par\u00adties in conjunction with state and local election efforts. Notably, and with few exceptions, that was not the case. There were certainly more points of contact with state officials that helped smooth the voting process on Election Day and more time to litigate contested issues before Election Day. But in terms of organizational structure, the campaign was run through the presidential effort and not through the state parties.\r\n\r\nIssacharoff, Outsourcing Politics, supra note 4, at 847\u201348. Contribution caps to parties also limit the ability of political parties to coordinate with civic organizations in the party net\u00adwork in such endeavors without running afoul of contribution limits. See Bauer, The Right to \u201cDo Politics,\u201d supra note 30, at 77\u201379.[\/footnote] The effects of BCRA\u2019s constraints on the choices in the average campaign, in which resources are more limited and the payoff of a ground game less clear, however, are likely to be significant.\r\n\r\nThe <em>McConnell <\/em>Court, it is true, flatly rejected the suggestion that contribution caps limited the resources available to parties, pointing out the ways in which they merely incentivize parties to reach out to more individuals to achieve their fundraising goals. As the Court put it, \u201c[t]he \u2018overall effect\u2019 of dollar limits on contributions is \u2018merely to require candidates and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons.\u2019\u201d[footnote]McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 136 (2003) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 21\u201322 (1976)), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] On this view, contribution limits are not a burden on the associational life of parties; instead, they promote it by incentivizing parties to expand their donor base.\r\n\r\nThere are several problems with the <em>McConnell <\/em>Court\u2019s analysis. First, contribution limits may incentivize reaching out to more donors, but they do not incentivize spending on face-to-face mobilization efforts, as opposed to impersonal, media advertising, for example. Second, monetary contributions are a very thin sort of association. This is especially true of donations generated online or through mass mailings insofar as they provide no opportunity to facilitate a two-way street of communication.\r\n\r\nThird, and most damningly, it is unquestionably the case that Congress could have adopted far less restrictive alternatives that would have both contained the soft-money problem and maintained, perhaps even incentivized, the growth of the party faithful and richer forms of association. For one, BCRA could have exempted money raised to fund <em>individualized<\/em>, <em>face-to-face<\/em> forms of campaigning from its definition of federal election activity. Ironically, an early FEC rule turned on this distinction. Unfortunately, rather than exempting personalized voter-registration and get-out-the-vote activities from hard-money limits, the FEC excluded generic letters and prerecorded telephone calls from the statutory definition and thus the hard money restrictions.[footnote]Cf. Shays v. FEC, 528 F.3d 914, 931\u201332 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (striking down the FEC rule on grounds that, in the absence of a persuasive justification, the FEC\u2019s narrow defini\u00adtion \u201c[ran] directly counter to BCRA\u2019s purpose\u201d).[\/footnote] In other words, it redirected the flow of soft money to impersonal forms of voter engagement utterly incapable of facilitating a two-way street of communication.\r\n\r\nAnother less burdensome approach would have replaced the cumbersome Levin-fund amendment with an exemption allowing state and local political parties to freely coordinate with existing civic associations, including churches and unions, <em>in any face-to-face recruitment efforts<\/em>.[footnote]See Bauer, The Right to \u201cDo Politics,\u201d supra note 30, at 73 (expressing concern that current rules inhibit coalition building, rather than democratic participation per se); cf. Bob Bauer, Super PACs and Concerns About Political Equality, More Soft Money Hard Law (Feb. 12, 2016), http:\/\/www.moresoftmoneyhardlaw.com\/2016\/02\/super-pacs-concerns-political-equality\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/Y89V-BCAS] (\u201cTargeted regulatory relief should be available for other membership-based organizations, and even to candidates when conducting particular voter mobilization activities.\u201d).[\/footnote] It is well known that local parties with ties to labor unions or community-based associations tend to have substantial points of intersection with the electorate\u2014knocking on doors, hosting events with elected officials, and boosting turnout.[footnote]See Masket, supra note 38, at 184; cf. id. at 119\u201320, 180\u201382 (discussing Congresswoman Maxine Waters\u2019 ties with the New Frontier Democratic Club, \u201clocal activists,\u201d and \u201cmany church and civic leaders\u201d in South Los Angeles, and her influence over other elections in her district).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEither option would have been not only less burdensome but also more promising from an associational-party perspective. Both would have nudged the political parties to spend in ways more likely to mobilize a broader electorate (possibly even a more representative one) through the party faithful (including volunteers and state and local parties), thereby creating a variety of opportunities for opening up the two-way street of communication discussed above. Such targeted deregulation is far more promising than approaches that result in unbridled, unlimited contributions\u2014or that raise contribution limits for funding party conventions, headquarters, and litigation. To the degree that any monetary contribution raises some risk of corruption or its appearance (and, greater still, a risk of preferential treatment), surely it would be better to have the contributed money go toward activities that are most likely to produce a counterweight to those interests, such as an engaged electorate?[footnote]Cf. <em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 168 (raising the concern that \u201c[b]ecause voter registra\u00adtion, voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activity all confer substantial bene\u00adfits on federal candidates, the funding of such activities creates a significant risk of actual and apparent corruption\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo be sure, those who have challenged the constitutionality of the soft-money ban have not focused on these associational burdens. In the most recent challenge, brought by the Republican Party of Louisiana, there was no mention of a desire for expanded funds with which to engage in peer-to-peer mobilization efforts in order to expand its electoral base.[footnote]See Republican Party of La. v. FEC, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86 (D.D.C. 2016) (containing no mention of funds for peer-to-peer mobilization efforts), summarily aff\u2019d, 137 S. Ct. 2178 (2017).[\/footnote] Instead, the demand for unregulated contributions, it argued, would cover costs associated with its website, emails, and mass mailings.[footnote]Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment at 9\u201328, <em>Republican Party of La.<\/em>, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86 (No. 15-cv-01241), 2016 WL 1242607; see also Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief at 29\u201333, <em>Republican Party of La.<\/em>, 219 F.

Id. at 33.[\/footnote] In this regard, its complaint is consistent with the views of state party officials surveyed on the effects of federal campaign finance law, which made little mention of burdens on the sorts of peer-to-peer strategies that increase social capital.[footnote]Professor Raymond La Raja and Jonathan Rauch, similarly, focus on the compara\u00adtive advantage of state and local parties with respect to mass mailers. La Raja &amp; Rauch, supra note 5, at 5, 15\u201318 (emphasizing that state parties qualify for the nonprofit rate at the U.S. Postal Service, unlike Super PACs). Their survey did not specifically ask how often state parties engaged in peer-to-peer strategies for mobilization, in person or by email. This would appear to be a glaring oversight given that they argue that \u201cstate parties are\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the tissue of civic and cultural organizations that creates social capital by building connec\u00adtions, trust, and cooperation across diverse individuals and groups.\u201d Id. at 5; see also id. at 7, 20\u201321 (presenting survey data). It is difficult to see how mass mailers produce social capital.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAn associational-party perspective similarly offers a new measure for assessing the First Amendment burdens placed on political parties by BCRA\u2019s requirement that the \u201cservices provided during any month by an employee of a State, district, or local committee of a political party who spends more than 25 percent of that individual\u2019s compensated time during that month on activities in connection with a Federal election\u201d be undertaken with hard money.[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030101(20)(A)(iv), 30125(b) (2012).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo the degree this requirement undermines the organizational capacity to build a partisan network with sustained ties to the electorate, it poses a severe constitutional burden. It is well established that a significant weakness of the contemporary American party system is the seasonal quality of local and state party associations\u2014measured in terms of, inter alia, the number of full-time party staff between election seasons.[footnote]Douglas D. Roscoe &amp; Shannon Jenkins, Changes in Local Party Structure and Activity, 1980\u20132008, <em>in<\/em> The State of the Parties: The Changing Role of Contemporary American Parties 228, 237 (John C. Green et al. eds., 2014) (arguing the intermittent character of local party organizations results from the fact that they \u201cmainly are useful [to candidates] in the period immediately preceding elections and are less critical to candidates\u2014or anyone else\u2014during the interim intervals\u201d).[\/footnote] The infirmity of state and local parties is critical because they serve as the national parties\u2019 primary link to the electorate. As Justice Scalia astutely noted in his dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to strike down party patronage, a traditional instrument of party building and discipline, the need for low-level party workers is not \u201cobsolete\u201d:\r\n<blockquote>[Mass media has] supplemented but not supplanted personal contacts. Certainly they have not made personal contacts unnecessary in campaigns for the lower level offices that are the foundations of party strength, nor have they replaced the myriad of functions performed by party regulars not directly related to campaigning.[footnote]Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 105 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nOnce again, some might object that the requirement that state and local party workers who spend more than 25% of their time campaigning for federal elections be paid out of hard money has positive associational effects by creating an incentive to recruit volunteers. Surely, a volunteer-based political party is likely to have broader connections to the electorate than a professional party. Moreover, a volunteer-based party will have broader democratic repercussions insofar as initial forays into politics, such as volunteering to canvass a neighborhood for a campaign, are known to lead to even more substantial political activity.\r\n\r\nRegulations that incentivize the use of volunteers unquestionably have distinct associational benefits for all the previously stated reasons. Encouraging volunteerism is critical: Initial forays into electioneering are likely to breed or sustain activism beyond individual campaigns and thus feed the desired two-way street of communication, which depends on active and sustained membership within the party network.\r\n\r\nThat said, regulations that incentivize recruiting volunteers while undercutting the nodes within the formal party that are most capable of orchestrating that volunteerism impose significant First Amendment burdens. It is unquestionably difficult to organize volunteers without paid staff; moreover, it does not serve any larger democratic goal to insist that candidates reinvent a participatory network each cycle.\r\n\r\nFinally, from an associational-party perspective, BCRA\u2019s requirement that issue ads be undertaken with hard money no longer seems constitutionally suspect. When the path to responsible governance does not lie in the clarity of the message but in the breadth and depth of the network, the inclusion of issue ads within BRCA\u2019s regulatory purview is a much less significant First Amendment burden. The party\u2019s freedom of speech is adequately preserved by its ability to use hard money to speak <em>independently<\/em>.[footnote]Colo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604, 615\u201318 (1996); accord McConnell v.

FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] By contrast, when the route to good governance is understood to run through the party brand, it is the burdens on the party\u2019s ability to speak that are most troubling. It is BCRA\u2019s provision that issue ads must be purchased with hard money that raises the most alarm insofar as it undermines the party\u2019s capacity to disseminate its brand.[footnote]<em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 352 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt should now be clear how the doctrinal proposal being offered in this Essay is significantly different from the current state of the party jurisprudence. Simply put, the proposal being made is that the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework be extended to all cases involving challenges to regulatory burdens placed on the major political parties, and that courts should allocate First Amendment rights in ways that prevent regulation from undermining the socioeconomic and intergenerational breadth or the interpersonal depth of all partisan networks<em>.<\/em> The current doctrinal preoccupation with shoring up party elites and their ability to define and control their distinct political brand, in other words, would be replaced by a focus on how challenged regulations might impact a party\u2019s capacity to mobilize broad and representative political participation or to facilitate a two-way street of information transmission through party activists.\r\n<h3>C. From Here to There: Assessing Probabilities of Doctrinal Change<\/h3>\r\nOne remaining question is whether any of this is possible. Convincing the Court to bring consistency to its doctrine is an easy sell; persuading it to abandon the theoretical underpinnings of its doctrine, less so. Still, there may be more opportunity than usual to do so. The associational-party path to responsive governance fits more comfortably within the First Amendment tradition than the theoretical alternatives the Supreme Court has rejected in the past.[footnote]See Stephanopoulos, supra note 100, at 288, 291\u201398 (noting the Supreme Court\u2019s commitment to an individual-rights-based approach and its unwillingness to reorganize doctrine around competitiveness).[\/footnote] For one, it speaks in the traditional register of rights. For another, it is premised on a commit\u00adment shared by both wings of the current Supreme Court that citizen participation breeds democratic responsiveness and accountability.\r\n\r\nThe centrality of political participation to our republican form of government is a leitmotif in the Court\u2019s decisions relating to parties and elections. In <em>California Democratic Party v. Jones<\/em>, Justice Kennedy asserted that \u201c[e]ncouraging citizens to vote is a legitimate, indeed essential, state objective; for the constitutional order must be preserved by a strong, participatory democratic process.\u201d[footnote]540 U.S. 567, 587 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (striking down the state\u2019s blanket primary as a threat to the party leadership\u2019s control of its message).[\/footnote] More recently, Chief Justice Roberts explained:\r\n<blockquote>There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders. Citizens can exercise that right in a variety of ways: They can run for office themselves, vote, urge others to vote for a particular candidate, volunteer to work on a campaign, and contribute to a candi\u00addate\u2019s campaign.[footnote]McCutcheon v. FEC, 134 S. Ct. 1434, 1440\u201341 (2014) (arguing \u201ca central feature of democracy\u201d is the notion that \u201ccandidates who are elected can be expected to be responsive to [the] concerns\u201d of those who contributed to their campaigns) (citing Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 360 (2010)). Professors Fishkin and Gerken make a fair point that <em>McCutcheon<\/em> offers an odd and elitist version of democratic participation and influence insofar as it frames donors as constituents to which responsiveness is in order, despite the fact that those donors typically live outside the district. Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 203.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nNor is the motif a new one. In <em>FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc<\/em>., a case involving a challenge to rules related to corporate election spend\u00ading, the Court\u2019s decision to strike down certain federal restrictions on corporate political spending was driven, in part, by a concern that complying with the challenged regulations might lead some civic groups to \u201cdecide[] that the contemplated political activity was simply not worth it.\u201d[footnote]479 U.S. 238, 255, 263 (1986) (Brennan, J.) (holding unconstitutional a federal law that prohibited a voluntary political association from using its treasury funds to finance a pro-life voter guide simply because of the organization\u2019s corporate form and noting \u201c[v]oluntary political associations do not suddenly present the specter of corruption merely by assuming the corporate form\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEqually relevant, the Court routinely assumes\u2014perhaps a little too naively\u2014that democratic participation leads to political responsiveness. Justice Kennedy, in particular, is prone to emphasize the need for First Amendment protections at the nexus between political participation and legislative responsiveness.[footnote]See, e.g., <em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 297 (Kennedy, J., dissenting in part) (\u201cIt is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is prem\u00adised on responsiveness.\u201d).[\/footnote] In fact, this nexus appears to have motivated his decision to write separately in <em>Nevada Commission for Ethics v. Carrigan<\/em>, a case involving a challenge to a statute that mandated legislative recusals on matters in which a reasonable person would think the legislator had a material interest through a personal connection.[footnote]564 U.S. 117, 129 (2011) (Kennedy, J., concurring).[\/footnote] Justice Kennedy\u2019s reservations about the premise underlying Nevada\u2019s statute are revealing:\r\n<blockquote>As a general matter, citizens voice their support and lend their aid because they wish to confer the powers of public office on those whose positions correspond with their own. That dynamic, moreover, links the principles of participation and representation at the heart of our democratic government. Just as candidates announce positions in exchange for citizens\u2019 votes, so too citizens offer endorsements, advertise their views, and assist political campaigns based upon bonds of common purpose. These are the mechanisms that sustain representative democracy.[footnote]Id. at 131\u201332.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nFor all these reasons, the associational-party path to responsive governance fits comfortably within the First Amendment tradition. The value of common ground should not be underestimated when it comes to proposals for doctrinal change, especially when some members of the Court may already be wary of the path it has forged.[footnote]See supra notes 102\u2013113 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the proposed extension of the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to cases involving the First Amendment rights of the major political parties has several virtues. First, it provides an eminently plausi\u00adble way of working within the contours of existing First Amendment doctrine to underwrite those segments of the partisan network that already enhance opportunities for social contact between party elites and the broader electorate and their associated virtues. Second, it offers to bring coherence to the doctrine, and it resonates with existing commit\u00adments of a doctrine that the Court itself has devised to serve broader democratic goals of responsiveness and accountability. In that regard, it provides a relatively easy point of entry for doctrinal reform. Finally, the extension demonstrates what a commitment to incremental change looks like as well as how the theory could inform campaign finance reform should that topic return to the political agenda.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nThe Supreme Court has long granted political parties constitutional protection from government intrusion in recognition of their central role in promoting democratic accountability. Unfortunately, it has done so on the basis of a set of theoretical assumptions about how to induce responsive and responsible governance that do not hold true in contemp\u00adorary American politics. Worse still, this attachment to responsible party government has crowded out other plausible paths to self-governance.\r\n\r\nThis Essay has argued that the Court\u2019s recent denials of certiorari in important party cases have granted a much-needed reprieve\u2014an opportunity to pause to consider an alternative path to responsive and responsible governance. In doing so, it has explained the basis for believing that an alternative path exists once we focus on political parties as civic associations rather than speakers. More specifically, it has argued that reinforcing the chains of democratic accountability lies in the promotion of integrated, cross-class partisan networks.\r\n\r\nAchieving responsive and accountable governance by strengthening the breadth and depth of partisan networks will be difficult. The changes in the structure of American society since the 1950s are here to stay. The route to political power no longer runs through veterans\u2019 groups, the Masonic Lodges, or the Klan, and few want the key to political power to return to sex-segregated and racially exclusionary men\u2019s clubs. Socioeconomic segregation in American life is also fairly entrenched.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, given the known failures of responsible party govern\u00adment, an associational approach presents the only viable way to induce responsive and accountable governance today. It is theoretically optimal, both as a guide to structuring First Amendment doctrine and as a measure for future regulatory reforms\u2014even as it does not guarantee a cure to all our democratic ills. And it is, therefore, essential to begin to identify those opportunities to reshape existing partisan networks given the world in which we live.\r\n\r\nEmbracing the associational-party framework is a necessary compo\u00adnent of any multidimensional approach to addressing the democratic dysfunctions that pervade U.S. politics. Democracy is an aspiration that requires ongoing work. The goal at any given moment is to attain more, rather than fewer, of these democratic goods. Party reform will inevitably be only a partial solution. The parties\u2019 incentives to accurately inform ordinary citizens are limited, and their interests in being held accountable are even weaker. If political parties were the only piece in the self-governance puzzle, the project would likely be doomed to fail. Thankfully, there are other institutions\u2014most importantly, civic associations and the press. Each has mixed incentives, but each can also compensate for the limits of the others, and therein lies a basis for hope. To the degree the sorts of party reforms advocated for here are married to efforts to revitalize civic associations for ordinary Americans, there is significant room for optimism.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 26\u201329 (1976) (upholding limits on indi\u00advidual campaign contributions due to the state\u2019s compelling interest in preventing the appearance of quid pro quo corruption).[\/footnote] Unfortunately, in doing so, it has adopted a set of theoretical assumptions that do not hold true in the real world of contemporary politics. Known in the literature as \u201crespon\u00adsible party government,\u201d the theory, which, as it happens, also accounts for the specifics of the recent calls for party reform, presumes that electoral accountability emerges from the choice between ideologically distinct political parties during competitive elections.[footnote]For an explanation of responsible party government and a comparison to promi\u00adnent theories of political parties, see John H. Aldrich, Why Parties? A Second Look 8\u201316 (2011).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nResponsible party government theory underpins the Court\u2019s juris\u00adprudence on the First Amendment rights of political parties. It is responsible party government that explains not only why current constitutional doctrine entrenches the two-party system but also why it invariably sides with the leaders of the two major parties when internal disputes arise.[footnote]See infra notes 65\u201379 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Accordingly, whatever the precise ruling might have been in <em>Republican Party of Louisiana v. FEC<\/em>, one thing was virtually certain: The Court\u2019s reasoning would have taken place within the confines of this particular account of how to harness the imperfect incentives of political parties to produce democratic accountability. Thus, its recent decisions not to take up important cases involving the First Amendment rights of political parties provide an opportunity to revisit the commitment to responsible party government and, potentially, to head off any efforts to constitutionalize a party-reform agenda that appears doomed to fail.\r\n\r\nThe commitment to responsible party government in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, and also among party reformers, is a colossal mistake. Responsible party government has not panned out. The political parties are stronger and more ideologically distinct than in any prior era.[footnote]See Pew Research Ctr., Political Polarization in the American Public 6 (2014), http:\/\/www.people-press.org\/2014\/06\/12\/political-polarization-in-the-american-public\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/ML83-37QW] (\u201cRepublicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines\u2014and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive\u2014than at any point in the last two decades.\u201d). See generally Michael Barber &amp; Nolan McCarty, Causes and Consequences of Polarization, <em>in<\/em> Political Negotiation: A Handbook 37, 39\u201343 (Jane Mansbridge &amp; Cathie Jo Martin eds., 2016) (measuring increasing partisan polarization and decreasing dimensionality of political conflict).[\/footnote] Yet, responsible party government has not emerged. Indeed, as one promi\u00adnent political scientist has concluded, \u201c[t]he scope for independent action by elected leaders\u201d is especially great today, with the \u201cpaucity of elite responsiveness to public opinion extend[ing] even to issues on which public opinion seems to be unusually firm and stable.\u201d[footnote]Larry M. Bartels, Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age 287 (1st ed. 2008); see also Stephen Ansolabehere et al., Candidate Positioning in U.S. House Elections, 45 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 136, 152\u201354 (2001) (arguing that it is the utility to incumbents of ideological coherence within the party that accounts for this pattern).[\/footnote] To the extent there is accountability today, it is almost entirely to party donors and ideological groups.[footnote]Cf. Mann &amp; Corrado, supra note 4, at 1 (highlighting the effects of increased involvement of \u201c[i]deologically-based outside groups financed by wealthy donors\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhereas the debate in legal-academic and policy circles has been driven by fidelity to responsible party government despite its well-documented failures, this Essay argues that it is time to admit that responsible party government has run its course as a means for achieving democratic accountability and, therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s political party jurisprudence is in desperate need of a theoretical overhaul. Respon\u00adsible party government is premised on the existence of competi\u00adtive elections that provide each party with an incentive to mobilize the electorate and, accordingly, address the interests of the median voter.[footnote]See Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 308 (\u201cIf general elections were competitive, winning candidates would, in theory, have to be responsive to the median voter in the general election.\u201d).[\/footnote] We, however, live in a world of increasingly uncompetitive elections, and there is no reason to expect that to change anytime soon.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7 (noting that in recent cycles only about one out of twenty House elections were competitive\u2014defined as a margin of victory of less than 5%\u2014and that the numbers are only marginally better for the Senate); see also Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 309\u201310 (discussing the decline of competitive elections).[\/footnote] For one, although the Supreme Court has shown fidelity to the need for strong parties, it has been singularly unreceptive to adopting a procompetition theory of the First Amendment that would ensure the requisite condi\u00adtions for competitive elections.[footnote]The architects of this approach are Samuel Issacharoff and Richard H. Pildes. See generally Samuel Issacharoff &amp; Richard H. Pildes, Politics as Markets: Partisan Lockups of the Democratic Process, 50 Stan. L. Rev. 643 (1998). Although many continue to pin their hopes on a change of heart, to date, the Court has yet to take the bait. See Benisek v. Lamone, 266 F. Supp. 3d 799 (D. Md. 2017), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 543 (2017); Whitford v. Gill, 218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (W.D. Wis. 2016), argued, Transcript of Oral Argument, No. 16-1161 (U.S. Oct. 3, 2017).[\/footnote] Thus, absent mechanisms for direct democratic reform, increasing party competition would depend on legis\u00adlatures acting against their self-interest. Further, there is good reason to believe that the lack of party competition in most places is substantially, and increasingly, a result of ideological geographic self-sorting rather than partisan gerrymandering.[footnote]See, e.g., Drutman, supra note 7 (noting the geographic divide in partisan identi\u00adties); Reiham Salam &amp; Rob Richie, Opinion, How to Make Congress Bipartisan, N.Y.

Conceiving of parties almost exclusively <em>as ideological speakers<\/em>, they have failed to systematically explore the part associations can play in mobilizing and informing citizens and in facilitating a two-way street of communication between party leaders and ordinary voters, let alone the ways such efforts could contribute to good governance.[footnote]See infra section II.C.2.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is important to acknowledge up front that, unlike traditional responsible party government theory, an associational-party perspective starts from the premise that \u201cAmerican political parties are not solely elite institutions selling their brand to a passive public\u201d[footnote]Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 203\u201304.[\/footnote] and seeks a thicker form of democracy in which the political participation of ordinary citizens is not confined to \u201cthe general election, with the table already set and the menu already chosen.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 204. In this regard, the associational-party perspective unapologetically rejects the notion that \u201cthe people are a sovereign that \u2018can speak only when spoken to,\u2019 and \u2018whose vocabulary is limited to two words, \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d\u2019\u201d Michael S. Kang, The Hydraulics and Politics of Party Regulation, 91 Iowa L. Rev. 131, 167 (2005) (quoting E.E. Schattschneider, Party Government 52 (Greenwood Press 1977) (1942)) [hereinafter Kang, Hydraulics].[\/footnote] But it does so without ignoring the fact that \u201c<em>somebody <\/em>is going to organize politics,\u201d and that somebody is likely to be somebody with money, who may well \u201cdemand a price.\u201d[footnote]Seth E. Masket, No Middle Ground: How Informal Party Organizations Control Nominations and Polarize Legislatures 203 (2009).[\/footnote] In this regard, the associational-party perspective offers a marriage between the pragmatic tradition, which accepts political parties for what they are\u2014associations dominated by self-interested political elites\u2014and the romantic tradition, which seeks enhanced democratic accountability through the political participation of ordinary citizens as agents rather than consumers.[footnote]Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 815\u201316 (defining the two tradi\u00adtions while denigrating the latter).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is equally important to acknowledge upfront that the associational-party path is predicated on the assumption that entrenched problems demand multifaceted interventions aimed at incremental change. The current party system is unsustainable in the long term, and reforms grounded in responsible party government are not promising. It is, therefore, critically important not only to entertain alternative theoret\u00adical foundations but also to identify corresponding opportunities to address the dysfunctions of our party system in an incremental fashion.\r\n\r\nThis Essay concentrates on the Court\u2019s First Amendment jurispru\u00addence, identifying opportunities within existing doctrine to avoid consti\u00adtutionally requiring wholesale deregulation of party finances. In so doing, it illustrates how that same doctrinal vehicle would permit courts to strategically underwrite the strength of those segments of the partisan network that enhance opportunities for social contact between party elites and the broader electorate (including with the aid of money) and thus further the goals of an associational path to responsive governance.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this Essay argues for extending the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework, which the Supreme Court developed in cases involving burdens on the right to participate in elections,[footnote]See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 782 (1983).[\/footnote] to cases implicating the associational rights of the major political parties. The <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework has the distinct virtue of requiring courts to weigh the severity of constitutional burdens <em>before<\/em> imposing strict scrutiny.[footnote]<em>Burdick<\/em>, 504 U.S. at 434 (\u201cUnder this standard, the rigorousness of our inquiry\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\u201d). Thus, under the standard, when First and Fourteenth Amendment rights are subjected to \u201csevere\u201d restrictions, the regulation must be \u201cnarrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.\u201d Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992). \u201cBut when a state election law provision imposes only \u2018reasonable, nondiscriminatory restric\u00adtions\u2019 upon\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [the] rights of voters, \u2018the State\u2019s important regulatory interests are gener\u00adally sufficient to justify\u2019 the restrictions.\u201d <em>Burdick<\/em>, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting <em>Anderson<\/em>, 460 U.S. at 788).[\/footnote] Developed to wrestle with the reality that the legitimacy of our democracy frequently depends on establishing election procedures, the test explicitly foregrounds analysis of the burdens, reserving strict scrutiny for cases in which regulatory burdens are severe.[footnote]<em>Burdick<\/em>, 504 U.S. at 433\u201334 (recounting that only those regulations severely restricting voting \u201cmust be \u2018narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance\u2019\u201d because to operate otherwise \u201cwould tie the hands of States seeking to assure that elections are operated equitably and efficiently\u201d insofar as \u201c[e]lection laws will invariably impose some burden[s]\u201d (quoting <em>Norman<\/em>, 502 U.S. at 289)).[\/footnote] Because it is already sensitive to determining which burdens are of constitutional dimension, it provides a suitable vehicle for integrating the associational-party path into existing doctrine. As such, the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> frame\u00adwork is also well positioned to attend to the longstanding goal of the Court\u2019s political party cases\u2014ensuring responsible governance.\r\n\r\nThe associational-party perspective, however, requires two modifica\u00adtions to current doctrine. First, the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework would be extended to all contexts implicating the right to associate, including those involving the two major political parties. Second, and more import\u00adantly, the associational-party perspective demands a new scale with which to weigh and differentiate the burdens on a party\u2019s First Amendment rights. In the typical <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> case, courts balance the character and magnitude of the alleged burden on voting against state interests.[footnote]See, e.g., Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 190, 202\u201303 (2008) (applying the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework and determining that requiring voters to provide a photo identification did not, in principle, impose a severe burden on the right to vote).[\/footnote] In the party context, in weighing the severity of constitutional burdens, the focus would shift to assessing the regulatory impact on a party\u2019s capacity to mobilize broad and representative political participation and facilitate a two-way street of information transmission through party activists. It would, thereby, ensure that First Amendment rights are allo\u00adcated in ways that are more, rather than less, likely to encourage political parties and their candidates to heed the concerns of their constituents.\r\n\r\nThe principal mistake of the Court\u2019s doctrine has been its singular preoccupation with protecting political parties, as speakers, from bur\u00addens placed on their brand.[footnote]Cf. McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 352 (2003) (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (explaining that \u201cthe national political parties are exemplars of political speech,\u201d \u201cpro\u00admot[ing] coordinated political messages\u201d and existing often \u201cprimarily for the purpose of expressing ideas and generating debate\u201d), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] The latter modification provides a way to redirect the doctrinal focus from shoring up party elites and their ability to define and control a distinct political brand. Instead, courts would allocate First Amendment rights in ways that prevent regulation from undermining the socioeconomic and intergenerational breadth or the interpersonal depth of partisan networks.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, this doctrinal proposal is not entirely a professor\u00adial pipe dream. The Supreme Court\u2019s political party jurisprudence is ripe for reform. First, it is already structured around the idea that First Amendment rights must be allocated to facilitate democratic account\u00adability.[footnote]See infra section I.A.[\/footnote] As such, it provides a relatively easy point of entry. Further, the extension of the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework would merely rationalize the doctrine. Second, a growing consensus has emerged that our political party system needs fundamental reform if responsible and responsive governance is to emerge.[footnote]See supra notes 4, 7\u20139 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Thus, there is a good deal of political will, possibly even among the Justices in light of the Court\u2019s recent decisions, for change.\r\n\r\nPart I of this Essay begins by recounting the origins of responsible party government and explaining the ways it underpins the Court\u2019s entire party jurisprudence. Part I\u2019s central contribution, however, is the evidence it provides of the growing consensus that responsible party government has given way to irresponsible party governance. In doing so, it sets up the central argument of this Essay: that we have no choice but to consider alternative paths to responsive and accountable governance. Part II proceeds to make the case that an alternate path to democratic responsiveness and accountability emerges when one focuses on political parties <em>as associations<\/em>. It reviews the empirical evidence supporting the importance of social ties to political mobilization, organization, and information transmission as well as the implications of recent changes to the associational qualities of partisan networks. Finally, Part III identifies opportunities within existing First Amendment doctrine to sustain and build partisan networks more capable of producing democratic respon\u00adsiveness and accountability. Integrating an associational-party perspective into existing First Amendment doctrine is obviously only a first step. The fact, however, that there are no simple fixes to the ills of our party system should not diminish the value of incremental change.\r\n<h2>I. From Responsible Party Government to Irresponsible Party Governance<\/h2>\r\nResponsible party government theory underpins both the Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the First Amendment rights of political parties and the particulars of recent calls to reform our party system. This Part first recounts the origins and specifics of the theory of responsible party government, and how this theory is reflected in the case law. It then sets out the evidence demonstrating that the theory of responsible party government has not panned out as expected.\r\n<h3>A. Responsible Party Government and the First Amendment Rights of Political Parties<\/h3>\r\nNotwithstanding the Founding Fathers\u2019 opposition to political parties as quintessential factions, the Supreme Court has consistently afforded political parties robust First Amendment rights given their critical part in \u201cthe transformation of the voters\u2019 will into a government that reflects that will.\u201d[footnote]Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 357 (2004) (Breyer, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] In fact, the Court has consciously allocated First Amendment rights in ways believed to encourage broader democratic goals, including participation and accountability.[footnote]See Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 138 (identifying and criticizing courts and commentators for their unrelenting efforts to devise regulatory proposals and judicial doctrines that encourage political parties \u201cto promote democratic values like political participation, an informed electorate, and\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. democratic responsiveness\u201d).[\/footnote] Unfortunately, it is attached to a theory of how to harness parties\u2019 self-interest to democratic ends that\u2014whatever its original merits\u2014has not panned out as anticipated.\r\n\r\nParties are a puzzle for democracies. On the one hand, representa\u00adtive government in the modern nation state is unimaginable without a party system to organize voters, candidates, and legislators.[footnote]Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 574 (2000) (\u201cRepresentative democ\u00adracy in any populous unit of governance is unimaginable without the ability of citizens to band together in promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse their political views.\u201d); see also Aldrich, supra note 18, at 3\u201364 (explaining that without party identifica\u00adtions, voters would not be able to hold individual elected officials accountable for acts of government and elected officials would not be able to muster a record on which to be judged).[\/footnote] As Jonathan Rauch colorfully puts this point: \u201cIf the Constitution [is] the system\u2019s DNA, the parties\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [are] its RNA, translating the Founders\u2019 bare-bones framework\u201d into a working government.[footnote]Rauch, supra note 8.[\/footnote] On the other hand, \u201cparties are no great friends of popular sovereignty.\u201d[footnote]Kathleen Bawn et al., A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics, 10 Persp. on Pol. 571, 572 (2012).[\/footnote] In the business of reelec\u00adtion, their <em>preferred <\/em>mode of operation is to persuade voters to accept their preexisting agendas; only infrequently and reluctantly, and often in the face of defeat, do political parties modify their platforms to reflect the preferences of their members.[footnote]Id. (noting that political parties seek to \u201ccede as little policy to voters as possi\u00adble\u201d); see also Martin Gilens, Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America 163 (2012) (concluding that data reveals \u201cparties behave more like pol\u00adicy maximizers than vote maximizers, responding to the preferences of the public (and disproportionately to the most affluent segment of the public) when necessary but pursu\u00ading their own policy agendas when they can\u201d).[\/footnote] Their traditional manifestation is the \u201cmachine[]\u201d and its somewhat unseemly \u201cpowerbrokers.\u201d[footnote]Rauch, supra note 8 (noting further that \u201c[p]arties, machines, and hacks may not have been pretty, but at their best they did their job so well the country forgot why it needed them\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis tension between the <em>realpolitik<\/em> of political parties and the constitutional aspiration of self-governance gives rise to a central preoccu\u00adpation among scholars of American democracy: Given their primary interest in aggrandizing power, how can political parties and the candidates they field be induced to govern responsively?\r\n\r\nEnter responsible party government theory. In the 1950s, a group of prominent political scientists, under the auspices of the American Political Science Association (APSA), theorized a resolution to the paradoxical role parties play in modern democracies\u2014a resolution that has dominated the field of political science since its inception. Known in the literature as responsible party government, it posited that the key to achieving democratic accountability is to provide the electorate a clear choice between candidates representing distinct political parties on election day.[footnote]Am. Political Sci. Ass\u2019n, Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System: A Report of the Committee on Political Parties of the American Political Science Association, 44 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 1, 15 (1950) [hereinafter APSA Report].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUnderlying the theory was a market metaphor: Political parties should be conceptualized as the producers of a product (candidates and platforms) that voters consume.[footnote]Nancy L. Rosenblum, Primus Inter Pares: Political Parties and Civil Society, 75 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 493, 496 (2000) [hereinafter Rosenblum, Primus Inter Pares] (explain\u00ading that mainstream political science views \u201celectoral parties as cadres of candidates, professional organizers, and hired consultants, and of citizens as consumers of their prod\u00aducts\u201d); see also Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 201 &amp; n.94 (noting the marketplace metaphor was brought into the legal literature by the work of Samuel Issacharoff and Richard H. Pildes).[\/footnote] Just as consumers\u2019 interests are served by competition among producers to make appealing products, the electorate\u2019s interests are served by competition between parties to produce an appealing political brand\u2014one that voters \u201cpurchase\u201d on election day. The basic theory is nicely summarized by Justice Breyer in his dissent in <em>Vieth v. Jubelirer<\/em>:\r\n<blockquote>[P]olitical parties play a necessary role in [transforming the will of the majority into effective government]. At a minimum, they help voters assign responsibility for current circumstances, thereby enabling those voters, through their votes for individual candidates, to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the political status quo. Those voters can either vote to support that status quo or vote to \u201cthrow the rascals out.\u201d A party-based political system that satisfies this minimal condition encourages democratic responsibility. It facilitates the transformation of the voters\u2019 will into a government that reflects that will.[footnote]541 U.S. 267, 356\u201357 (2004) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citations omitted); see also Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 531 (1980) (Powell, J., dissenting) (\u201cVoters with little infor\u00admation about individuals seeking office traditionally have relied upon party affiliation as a guide to choosing among candidates.\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe theory\u2019s principal payoff was that it appeared to offer a cheap solution to the persistent problem ignorant voters pose for democratic accountability. Faced with the limited capacity of individual citizens to monitor elected officials, responsible party government theory side\u00adstepped the difficult task of producing an informed electorate. Instead, it sought to create a mechanism by which accountability to the electorate would be achieved indirectly through a strong two-party system in which ideologically distinct political parties competed for votes on election day. Critical to the success of the system was to empower party leaders to produce brands that would offer ignorant political consumers significant information about candidates at low cost, thereby \u201c\u2018reducing the transaction costs\u2019 of democracy.\u201d[footnote]Rosenblum, Primus Inter Pares, supra note 55, at 497.[\/footnote] Professor Michael McConnell summarizes the basic hypothesis well:\r\n<blockquote>To be sure, ideological labels are crude and one-dimensional, but they provide more accurate signals for the rationally igno\u00adrant voter than the old party labels, under which a \u201cDemocrat\u201d might be far more conservative than his \u201cRepublican\u201d opponent\u00a0. . . . Ideologically coherent party identification can be seen as a form of \u201ctruth in labeling\u201d: the voter knows what he or she is getting. Voters then have a clearer choice between directions for the country, which enables them to force a shift in policy.[footnote]Michael W. McConnell, Moderation and Coherence in American Democracy, 99 Calif. L. Rev. 373, 379 (2011); see also John H. Aldrich &amp; John D. Griffin, Parties, Elections, and Democratic Politics, <em>in<\/em> Oxford Handbook of American Elections and Political Behavior 595, 598\u2013606 (Jan E. Leighley ed., 2010).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nResponsible party government, in other words, took political parties as they were, while promising to harness the self-interest of these elite organizations toward \u201csmall-d\u201d democratic ends.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, legal reforms were necessary. The APSA Report recommended a series of reforms aimed to balance party discipline and voice.[footnote]See APSA Report, supra note 54, at 67 (emphasizing two-way communication between the national party council and its members); see also id. at 22, 65\u201367 (addressing efforts to increase voice and membership).[\/footnote] Reforms to the nomination process, in particular, took a central place. The closed primary was the key to the entire initiative. It would provide party members a voice, thereby reducing intraparty conflicts.[footnote]Id. at 10.[\/footnote] The APSA Report hypothesized that increasing the say of party members with respect to both candidates and platforms by adopting a direct primary would improve buy-in to a national platform from the party faithful.[footnote]Id. at 66\u201367 (arguing that \u201cgeneral and wholehearted support of the party pro\u00adgram\u201d would follow from the reorganization of the party \u201con democratic lines\u201d and that \u201ccohesion [would] spring[] naturally from willingness to support aims which the member himself has helped to shape and has come to accept\u201d).[\/footnote] At the same time, limiting participation in the primary to party members would provide an opportunity to produce more ideologically distinct candidates and platforms. Candidates and elected officials selected by a more coherent party base would be more capable of holding a party line, especially if party leaders maintained informal control over the selection of primary contenders.[footnote]Id. at 10, 66, 72 (observing \u201c[u]nity among leaders\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is difficult if they speak for members with entirely different objectives and fundamentally different ideas on public policy\u201d and noting \u201c[t]he formal or informal proposal of candidates by preprimary meet\u00adings of responsible party committees or party councils is a healthy development\u201d).[\/footnote] The APSA Report\u2019s analysis of the various alternative nominating processes makes clear its thinking:\r\n<blockquote>The direct primary probably can be adapted to the needs of parties unified in terms of national policy. <em>The closed primary deserves preference<\/em> because it is more readily compatible with the development of a responsible party system. <em>The open primary tends to destroy the concept of membership<\/em> as the basis of party organization. <em>Cross filing is bound to obscure program differences between the parties<\/em>, and to eliminate any sense of real membership on the part of the rank and file. The Washington <em>blanket primary corrupts the meaning of party even further by permitting voters at the same primary to roam at will among the parties<\/em>.[footnote]Id. at 10 (emphasis added). A blanket primary is one in which voters are pre\u00adsented with a single ballot, listing all the contenders, and are able to switch party primaries from office to office. See generally Alexander R. Podkul &amp; Elaine Kamarck, The Primaries Project: Blanket Primaries Have Yet to Deliver, Brookings Inst.

The Court\u2019s commitment to responsible party government\u2019s account of the path to democratic accountability explains both why the Court has consistently sided with the leaders of the two major parties when internal party conflicts arise and why it has taken positions in favor of entrench\u00ading the two-party system.\r\n\r\nFor one, the Court consistently rules in favor of the party leader\u00adship\u2019s control of the brand in conflicts between leaders and members.

Here, by contrast, where the associational interests are being asserted by a minor party rather than by one of the dominant parties, the Court has reversed course and rejected those associational interests as insubstantial compared to the interests asserted by the State.[footnote]Id. at 619 n.11 (Stevens, J., dissenting).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nIn sum, the Supreme Court has long accepted that the First Amendment rights of political parties should be allocated in ways that channel their self-interest to produce democratic accountability. The problem, as will be shown in the next section, is that the theoretical assumptions upon which the Supreme Court has predicated its party jurisprudence do not hold true in the real world of contemporary politics.\r\n<h3>B. Irresponsible Party Governance and the Need to Revisit the Theoretical Foundation of the Court\u2019s Party Jurisprudence<\/h3>\r\nWhatever the merits of responsible party government as a solution to the problems faced by mid-twentieth-century American parties, it has not panned out as anticipated. More ideologically distinct than in any prior era, the Democratic and Republican parties today are closer than ever before to the ideal called for by the APSA Committee on Political Parties.[footnote]See Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 276\u201377 (summarizing consensus on the polarization of the parties). One succinct measure of this trend is the changing perceptions of the political parties among independent voters. In 1956, around the time of the APSA Report, \u201c64% of independents in 1956 failed to see a difference between the two parties on at least one of the five more salient issues, compared to 21% of strong partisans;\u201d by contrast, in 2012, only 14% of independents failed to recognize some issue differences between the parties. Corwin D. Smidt, Polarization and the Decline of the American Floating Voter, 61 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 365, 365, 368\u201369, 369 fig.2, 371, 373 (2017) (demonstrating \u201cthe clarity of differences between the two polarized parties makes it easy for\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Americans who ignore politics to recognize that there are meaningful differences between them\u201d and thus \u201cto recognize the meaning and consequences of candidate differ\u00adences,\u201d which in turn leads to fewer independent voters).[\/footnote] Yet, responsible party government has not emerged. As Professors Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson note wryly, \u201cWhat the committee coveted\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. was responsible party government. What they got\u2014along with the rest of us\u2014was <em>irresponsible <\/em>party government.\u201d[footnote]Jacob S. Hacker &amp; Paul Pierson, Off Center: The Republican Revolution and the Erosion of American Democracy 187 (2005).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nElections are failing to tether government officials to the pref\u00aderences of their constituents. The verdict, on this point, is unequivocal. Professor Larry Bartels has summed up the data as follows: \u201cWhatever elections may be doing, they are <em>not <\/em>forcing elected officials to cater to the policy preferences of the \u2018median voter.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Bartels, supra note 21, at 287.[\/footnote] In fact, while \u201c[t]he scope for independent action by elected leaders\u201d is \u201cespecially great in cases where public sentiment is divided, unstable, confused, or simply nonexistent[,]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the paucity of elite responsiveness to public opinion extends even to issues on which public opinion seems to be unusually firm and stable.\u201d[footnote]Id. Bartels further notes that \u201c[i]n most cases, even massive differences in the preferences of middle- and upper-income constituents\u201d have little \u201ceffect on senators\u2019 policy choices\u201d especially as compared to \u201ctheir own partisan ideologies.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] He is not alone in his assessment.[footnote]See, e.g., Gilens, supra note 52, at 83, 163, 166 (\u201cWhatever empirical validity median voter models may hold with regard to the professed positions of parties and candi\u00addates, the findings presented above [with respect to the years 1981 through 2002] clearly show that actual government policy does not respond to the preferences of the median voter.\u201d); Anthony Fowler &amp; Andrew B. Hall, Long-Term Consequences of Election Results, 47 Brit. J. Pol. Sci. 351, 354, 358, 366 (2015) (concluding a study of policy responsiveness in competitive moderate districts with the assessment that \u201c[a]cross American legislatures, elected representatives do not converge to the median voter in their constituency\u201d); Joe Soss &amp; Lawrence R. Jacobs, The Place of Inequality: Non-Participation in the American Polity, 124 Pol. Sci. Q. 95, 116 (2009) (\u201cIn recent decades, government officials have exhibited weak and declining levels of responsiveness to median public preferences.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEqually as important, the political parties that have emerged are remarkably ineffective at governing.[footnote]See, e.g., Sarah A. Binder, Stalemate: Causes and Consequences of Legislative Gridlock 25\u201326, 67\u201369 (2003) (demonstrating ways that party homogeneity undermines policy responsiveness by breeding polarization and gridlock); Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 808 (noting the government\u2019s inability to act even with res\u00adpect to issues that are pressing and with respect to which there is broad consensus).[\/footnote] Responsible party governance was predicated on the notions that the elected party would be capable of adopting the programs to which it had committed and, thus, could be judged on its legislative record come election day.[footnote]APSA Report, supra note 54, at 1.[\/footnote] The recent norm, however, has been gridlock in Congress and aggrandized presidential power to compensate for Congress\u2019s inability to act.[footnote]One\u2019s normative assessment of gridlock, obviously, varies depending on whether one is generally opposed to federal legislative action as unnecessary or an infringement on states\u2019 rights. Those who adhere to responsible party government, however, generally do not have a principled objection to governance at the federal level. Cf. Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 808 (assuming that in \u201carenas where there is broad consensual agreement that government <em>must <\/em>act, in some fashion,\u201d it is a problem that it \u201cseems incapable of doing so\u201d).[\/footnote] Nor has the return of unified government produced decisive governance.[footnote]See, e.g., Sheryl Gay Stolberg &amp; Nicholas Fandos, As Gridlock Deepens in Congress, Only Gloom Is Bipartisan, N.Y. Times (Jan. 27, 2018), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\r\n2018\/01\/27\/us\/politics\/congress-dysfunction-conspiracies-trump.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (noting bipartisan concern in Washington \u201cthat Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has pushed an already dysfunctional Congress into a near-permanent state of gridlock that threatens to diminish American democracy itself\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEven scholars who continue to adhere to responsible party gov\u00adernment acknowledge that strong political parties have not led to responsible party government. Professor Alan I. Abramowitz, for example, concedes that \u201calthough the conditions for responsible party government have largely been met on the electoral side, with ideologically defined parties offering voters a clear choice between alternative sets of policies,\u201d responsible and effective party governance has not followed.[footnote]Alan I. Abramowitz, The Disappearing Center: Engaged Citizens, Polarization, and American Democracy 160 (2010) [hereinafter Abramowitz, The Disappearing Center]. Abramowitz further argues that it is the structural features of divided government that are the \u201cmajor obstacle to effective party governance,\u201d rather than the prescriptions of the strong party thesis or the absence of party competition. Id.[\/footnote] Professor Seth Masket, meanwhile, grants that while the two major political parties are more ideologically distinct, including at the state level, than ever before, the accountability that has emerged has largely been to primary voters, donors, and other policy demanders capable of mounting credible primary challenges.[footnote]Masket, supra note 38, at 24\u201325 (noting a \u201cvirtual consensus\u201d that \u201c[c]andidates no longer converge on the median voter\u201d but rather \u201crepresent[] the ideologically extreme elements within their parties, despite the electoral risk that this strategy carries\u201d).[\/footnote] In Masket\u2019s view, the primary obstacle to accountability has been the unforeseen conse\u00adquences of the move to closed primary elections, which lead \u201clegislators [to] look to their party first and to their district second.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 93. Masket argues that \u201cthe view of officeholders as single-minded seekers of reelection,\u201d who tack back to the median voter, \u201chas little relevance [today], not because officeholders don\u2019t care about the electoral connection\u201d but because strong nominating parties today \u201cinterpose themselves between officeholders and voters and often thoroughly dominate the relationship.\u201d Id. at 19; see also Gilens, supra note 52, at 9\u201310 (\u201cMy findings seem to support the notion that parties in the United States have evolved from broad-based, vote-maximizing organizations attentive to the preferences of large and diverse publics to coalitions of intense, narrow \u2018policy demanders.\u2019\u201d); Soss &amp; Jacobs, supra note 84, at 117\u201318 (summarizing evidence that \u201c[t]he rising power of party activists has created strong incentives for politicians to discount the preferences of broad public opin\u00adion\u201d including, for instance, popular opinion on immigration reform). But see Ansolabehere et al., supra note 21, at 154 (arguing that it is the usefulness of a coherent legislative party to self-interested incumbents, rather than the presence of an ideologically extreme base, that accounts for candidates\u2019 failure to closely hew to constituents\u2019 preferences).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nYet, political scientists and legal academics continue to adhere to responsible party government almost as an article of faith.[footnote]See, e.g., Masket, supra note 38, at 24\u201325, 95\u201396, 195 (asserting that accountabil\u00adity to the party base, notwithstanding its failures, is preferable to diffuse accountability to the electorate insofar as the base and party operatives are better positioned to monitor the actions of legislators and thus thwart lobbyists from buying elected officials); see also Issacharoff, Outsourcing Politics, supra note 4, at 855, 861 (noting that members of the party in government \u201cforemost look[] to winning elections\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. by hewing close enough to the center of the political distribution of voters\u201d and concluding that \u201c\u2018stronger parties\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. might be the most effective vehicle for enabling the compromises and deals necessary to enable more effective governance\u2019\u201d (quoting Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 809\u201310)).[\/footnote] Meanwhile, there is little evidence that the general public\u2019s experience of the United States\u2019 newly polarized democracy is positive.[footnote]See John Wagner &amp; Scott Clement, \u2018It\u2019s Just Messed Up\u2019: Most Think Political Divisions as Bad as Vietnam Era, New Poll Shows, Wash.

Instead, the tendency in legal circles has been to focus on the most obvious fix, a theoretical patch, so to speak: increase party competition.[footnote]See, e.g., Samuel Issacharoff, Gerrymandering and Political Cartels, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 593, 629\u201330 (2002) (\u201c[A] focus on the competitive implications of rules governing the political process allows for confined yet effective court oversight to guard against con\u00adduct that frustrates democratic accountability.\u201d); Issacharoff &amp; Pildes, supra note 25, at 707 (arguing that there is a \u201chistorical basis\u201d for believing that political competition could counter vote dilution); see also Michael S. Kang, Race and Democratic Contestation, 117 Yale L.J. 734, 801\u201302 (2008) (noting that a theory of democratic contestation can provide a \u201csubstantive vision for healthy democratic politics\u201d); David Schleicher, \u201cPolitics as Markets\u201d Reconsidered: Natural Monopolies, Competitive Democratic Philosophy and Primary Ballot Access in American Elections, 14 Sup. Ct. Econ. Rev. 163, 176\u201387 (2006) (analyzing models of political contestation).[\/footnote] On this account, the strategic choice to cater to the ideologically extreme party base depends on knowing one is a shoo-in during the general election because the district is safe for one\u2019s party.[footnote]Jonathan Rauch summarizes the view succinctly: \u201cWalled safely inside their gerry\u00admandered districts, incumbents are insulated from general-election challenges that might pull them toward the political center, but they are perpetually vulnerable to primary challenges from extremists who pull them toward the fringes.\u201d Rauch, supra note 8; see also Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1151 (\u201c[T]he lack of partisan competition has unmoored political parties and candidates from the interests of their constituents. With the rise of safe districts, the party primary has increasingly become the most important election.\u201d).[\/footnote] Increasing party competition should therefore resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nWhether this would in fact work is somewhat disputed. On the one hand, data do show increased responsiveness where there is party competition and decreased responsiveness while one party dominates.[footnote]Martin Gilens\u2019s seminal investigation of policy responsiveness finds, for instance, that party competition, both in the electoral sphere and in legislatures, somewhat increases convergence toward the preferences of the public. See Gilens, supra note 52, at 192, 194 (concluding that \u201chigh levels of political competition in the form of an evenly divided Congress\u201d increases policy responsiveness while \u201celections appear to be only modestly successful at aligning policy outcomes with the preferences of the public\u201d). See generally id. at 162\u2013233 (comprehensively analyzing the degree to which elections prompt responsiveness as well as the effect of divided versus unified government on policy responsiveness). More specifically, Gilens found that \u201cpolicy responsiveness is\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. highest during the first congressional session after a shift in partisan control of the presidency\u201d but that dominance of one party generally reduces responsiveness to the elec\u00adtorate over time and enables the party to pursue its own agenda. Id. at 83, 163, 166. Despite these modest findings Gilens recommends \u201creforms that enhance political competition\u201d insofar as they \u201ccan intensify\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the responsiveness of policy makers.\u201d Id. at 10.[\/footnote] On the other hand, there are data questioning how much competition affects responsiveness given that voters rarely cast their votes based on overall legislative performance as theorized in the traditional model of responsible party government.[footnote]For example, a recent study by Anthony Fowler and Andrew B. Hall of competi\u00adtive moderate districts found Democratic and Republican legislators represent identical districts differently, demonstrating that officials elected in competitive elections do not necessarily cater to the median voter in their roll-call votes. Fowler &amp; Hall, supra note 84, at 351\u201352. Moreover, the discrepancy between legislators\u2019 roll-call votes and the prefer\u00adences of their districts does not lessen over time, and despite what one might expect, those elected officials are not kicked out of office for their policy divergence. Id. at 354\u201359. In sum, the authors conclude that \u201c[a]cross American legislatures, elected representatives do not converge to the median voter in their constituency.\u201d Id. at 352, 354\u201359, 364\u201368; accord Binder, supra note 85, at 108\u201311 (demonstrating that incumbents \u201cdo not pay an electoral price\u201d for legislative performance); Ansolabehere et al., supra note 21, at 154 (arguing partisanship rather than the presence of an ideologically extreme base accounts for candi\u00addates\u2019 failure to closely hew to constituents\u2019 preferences); see also Drutman, supra note 7 (summarizing recent literature).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBut here is the catch: Even if increasing party competition would substantially improve policy responsiveness, as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, that patch is off the table. The Court has been singularly unreceptive to structuring First Amendment doctrine in ways that increase party competition.[footnote]Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos, Elections and Alignment, 114 Colum. L.

In <em>New York State Board of Elections v. Lopez Torres<\/em>, a case in which judicial candidates challenged New York\u2019s cumbersome ballot access rules, the Court declared:\r\n<blockquote>The reason one-party rule is entrenched may be (and usually is) that voters approve of the positions and candidates that the party regularly puts forward.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The States can, within [constitutional] limits\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. discourage party monopoly\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But the Constitution provides no authority for federal courts to prescribe such a course. <em>The First Amendment creates an open marketplace where ideas<\/em>, most especially political ideas, may compete without government interference. <em>It does not call on the federal courts to manage the market by preventing too many buyers from settling upon a single product.<\/em>[footnote]N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, 208 (2008) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nLegislators, meanwhile, have zero incentive to approve measures aimed to increase partisan competition.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, time to reckon with the need for a theoretical overhaul. Whatever its merits at the time, a variety of developments in American politics since the 1950s, including those in election law, have undercut responsible party government\u2019s usefulness as a framework through which to achieve democratic responsiveness and accountability.\r\n\r\nThe Court\u2019s recent refusal to consider two cases involving First Amendment challenges on behalf of political parties squarely framed in terms of responsible party government theory provides a window of opportunity, possibly indicating that some members of the Court are growing wary of the path it has forged.[footnote]Democratic Party of Haw. v. Nago, 833 F.3d 1119, 1124 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2114 (2017); Republican Party of La. v. FEC, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86, 90\u201391 (D.D.C. 2016), summarily aff\u2019d, 137 S. Ct. 2178 (2017).[\/footnote] In fact, cracks in the responsible party government consensus may already be evident.\r\n\r\n<em>Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party<\/em> involved a challenge to the primary system Washington voters adopted when its blanket primary was struck down in the wake of <em>California Democratic Party v. Jones<\/em>.[footnote]552 U.S. 442, 444 (2008); see also Democratic Party of Wash. State v. Reed, 343 F.3d 1198, 1201\u201302 (9th Cir. 2003) (describing the history of Washington\u2019s blanket primary system).[\/footnote] Under Washington\u2019s new system, voters, regardless of party affil\u00adiation, are permitted to vote for any of the candidates seeking nomina\u00adtion for a given seat. The top two vote-getters for each office advance to the general election, creating the possibility that two candidates from the same party may run against one another in the general election.[footnote]See <em>Wash. State Grange<\/em>, 552 U.S. at 444.[\/footnote] Unlike in the traditional blanket primary, candidates select their party affiliation.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe challengers argued that the new blanket primary procedure was constitutionally infirm because nominees associated with the political party were not exclusively chosen by members of the party.[footnote]Id. at 452\u201353.[\/footnote] In this regard, the fundamental constitutional burden placed on a political party was exactly the same as in <em>Jones<\/em>: The party had been stripped of control over its brand, as candidates selected by the system were not authentic representatives of the party.[footnote]Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 581\u201382 (2000).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Court, however, dismissed these arguments out of hand, noting, \u201cThe nonpartisan blanket primary \u2018has all the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a party\u2019s nominee.\u2019\u201d[footnote]<em>Wash. State Grange<\/em>, 552 U.S. at 452 (quoting <em>Jones<\/em>, 530 U.S. at 585\u201386).[\/footnote] Washington\u2019s new primary system was constitutional under <em>Jones <\/em>because it did not purport to select party representatives; it selected the two most popular candidates for office to be placed on the general election ballot regardless of party affiliation.[footnote]Id. at 453 (\u201cThe flaw\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. in [the challengers\u2019] argument is that, unlike the California primary, the I\u2013872 primary\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2018does not serve to determine the nominees of a political party but serves to winnow the number of candidates to a final list of two for the general election.\u2019\u201d (quoting Wash.

As Justice Scalia argued in dissent, the very purpose of a blanket primary\u2014partisan or nonpartisan\u2014is to moderate the candidates that appear on the general election ballot.[footnote]Id. at 470 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cThere is no state interest behind this law except the Washington Legislature\u2019s dislike for bright-colors partisanship, and its desire to blunt the ability of political parties with noncentrist views to endorse and advocate their own candidates.\u201d).[\/footnote] Driving the point home, he wrote:\r\n<blockquote>Among the First Amendment rights that political parties possess is the right to associate with the persons whom they choose and to refrain from associating with persons whom they reject. Also included is the freedom to choose and promote \u201c\u2018the standard bearer who best represents the party\u2019s ideologies and preferences.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen an expressive organization is compelled to associate with a person whose views the group does not accept, the organization\u2019s <em>message<\/em> is undermined; the organization is understood to embrace, or at the very least tolerate, the views of the persons linked with them.[footnote]Id. at 463 (emphasis added) (citations omitted) (quoting Eu v.

Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 224 (1989)).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe constitutional foul of the nonpartisan primary remains the same, according to Justice Scalia, for individuals are allowed to \u201cappropriate the parties\u2019 trademarks\u201d at the critical juncture in an election, thus muddying the parties\u2019 messaging.[footnote]Id. at 471.[\/footnote] Further, the general election ballot may require a party to associate with a candidate that it perceives as being non\u00adrepresentative of its views.[footnote]Id. at 462. Justice Scalia went on to remark:\r\n\"Recognizing that parties draw support for their candidates by giving them the party <em>imprimatur<\/em>, Washington seeks to reduce the effectiveness of that endorsement by allowing <em>any<\/em> candidate to use the ballot for draw\u00ading upon the goodwill that a party has developed, while preventing the party from using the ballot to reject the claimed association or to iden\u00adtify the genuine candidate of its choice.\"\r\nId. at 464\u201365.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn sum, responsible party government has run its course as a basis either for allocating First Amendment rights to political parties or for devising party regulations in the interest of good governance. A variety of developments in American politics and law since the 1950s have undercut responsible party government\u2019s usefulness as a framework through which to achieve democratic responsiveness and accountability. In this regard, the Court\u2019s recent decisions are an invitation to consider a fresh path to responsive and accountable democratic governance.\r\n<h2>II. Forging a New Path to Responsive and Accountable Governance<\/h2>\r\nIt is time, therefore, to turn to the central contribution of this Essay: the development of an alternative theoretical foundation for achieving policy responsiveness through political parties. Drawing upon the empirical research on the drivers of political participation in both political science and sociology, this Part explains why measures targeted toward cultivating, strengthening, and broadening social ties within partisan networks present an alternative, and underappreciated, path to responsive and accountable governance. The argument is developed in four stages. Section II.A lays out key premises, including the operative definition of a political party, while introducing an overview of an associational-party path to responsive governance. Section II.B describes the empirical basis for believing that social ties not only breed political participation but also offset the limits to voters\u2019 interest and knowledge in politics by facilitating information transmission. The heavy lifting comes in section II.C, which draws out the implications of the empirical research for an alternative path to responsive governance. Finally, section II.D squarely addresses various bases for skepticism, arguing that, whatever its limits, a party-reform agenda tailored to strengthening the associational life of political parties\u2014including by redirecting the flow of money\u2014is significantly more promising than one that is singularly focused on strengthening the political power of party leaders.\r\n<h3>A. An Associational Path to Responsive Party Government<\/h3>\r\nThe puzzle of how to curb the tendency of elected officials to act out of self-interest or at the behest of special interests has plagued the repub\u00adlic since the Founding. Even as the Founders aspired to a republican form of government in which legislators would govern in the public interest, rather than simply vindicate their constituents\u2019 particularized advantages, they fretted over the potential for elected representatives to act out of self-interest or at the behest of special interests.[footnote]Robert C. Post, Citizens Divided: Campaign Finance Reform and the Constitution 15 (2014) (explaining the Founding generation\u2019s understanding that \u201ca representative government can fulfill the promise of self-government only if there is a close connection between representatives and their constituents\u201d).[\/footnote] Throughout the ratification debates, for instance, Anti-Federalists raised concerns that the new Constitution would give rise to \u201ca system in which the people would be effectively excluded from the world of public affairs and in which national leaders, only weakly accountable, would have enormous discretion to make law and policy.\u201d[footnote]Geoffrey R. Stone, Louis Michael Seidman, Cass R. Sunstein, Mark V. Tushnet &amp; Pamela S. Karlan, Constitutional Law 10 (7th ed. 2013).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution\u2019s primary answer to the threat of unaccountable politicians is periodic elections.[footnote]See Post, supra note 114, at 13 (noting the Federalists\u2019 position that frequent elections would serve to keep elected officials responsive); see also The Federalist No. 53, at 330 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (noting that \u201cwhere annual elections end, tyranny begins\u201d while wrestling with the question of the optimal interval for elec\u00adtions).[\/footnote] Regular elections, it was thought, would guarantee that representatives remained bound to their constitu\u00adents. The structural features of separation of powers and federalism would provide \u201cauxiliary precautions.\u201d[footnote]The Federalist No. 51, at 322 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (describing the structural devices of federalism and separation of powers as \u201cauxiliary precautions\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe shortcomings of elections as instruments for ensuring respon\u00adsiveness are well known.[footnote]While some argue that it is incoherent to speak of responsive governance because the electorate is incapable of having a preference, this Essay takes a pragmatic stance. In some theoretical sense this is no doubt true, but it is too far from our political culture or the law to be a valuable critique. For a summary of this extreme skepticism, see Schleicher, supra note 96, at 181\u201386 (explaining the critique but arguing that it is sufficient that voters have some political views and some capacity to judge their interests and preferences).[\/footnote] Among their myriad limitations as vehicles for producing accountability, one has proven particularly intractable: the quality of political participation. Even in a world of competitive districts in which turnout is high and representative, democratic accountability turns on voters having sufficient information to assess the adequacy of representation.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1152 (noting \u201c[v]oters cannot hold elected officials accountable if they do not know [what those offi\u00adcials have done]\u201d and observing that \u201celected officials who engage in off-center politics depend on the voting public not noticing\u201d); cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14\u201315 (1976) (recognizing that \u201c[i]n a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citi\u00adzenry <em>to make informed choices among<\/em> candidates for office is essential\u201d (emphasis added)).[\/footnote] Unfortunately, individuals face significant barriers when it comes to monitoring elected officials, and policy ignorance among voters is much more common than is policy knowledge.[footnote]See, e.g., Bawn et al., supra note 51, at 577\u201378 (identifying a large \u201cblind spot\u201d with respect to information about official behavior, which renders ordinary voters incapa\u00adble of holding politicians accountable through monitoring).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nResponsible party government pursued an indirect solution to the pervasiveness of voter ignorance. Presenting voters on election day with a choice between clear ideological brands, it hypothesized, would substi\u00adtute for actual knowledge.[footnote]See supra notes 52\u201355 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Meanwhile, an interest in winning office would incentivize the production of brands responsive to voter prefer\u00adences.[footnote]See Daniel Hays Lowenstein, Associational Rights of Major Political Parties: A Skeptical Inquiry, 71 Tex. L. Rev. 1741, 1760\u201363 (1993) (discussing the theory of responsi\u00adble party government).[\/footnote] As in the economic market, political parties would compete to provide the most desirable good, and accountability would follow.\r\n\r\nThe shortcut proved to be fool\u2019s gold. Merely consuming the political brands manufactured by party elites has not been enough to produce accountability.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7 (summarizing recent literature).[\/footnote] Despite the increasingly clear choice voters face, the weight of the evidence confirms the Anti-Federalists\u2019 worst fears.[footnote]See supra notes 115\u2013117 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] At the national level, our leaders are millionaires, \u201conly weakly accountable\u201d to the people, who leverage their enormous policy discretion largely to the advantage of others like themselves.[footnote]Stone et al., supra note 115, at 10; see also Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1136\u201340 (reviewing literature demonstrating that Congress is significantly more responsive to the wealthy than to the broader electorate).[\/footnote] Donors and ideological partisans have become the target audience for party brands, and concern for the preferences of the general electorate is largely coincidental.[footnote]See, e.g., Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1163\u201370 (explaining how party primaries today drive a wedge between elected officials and their constituents); Martin Gilens &amp; Benjamin I. Page, Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens, 12 Persp. on Pol. 564, 573 (2014) (conclud\u00ading a study of policy responsiveness from 1981 through 2002 by observing that the United States has become a \u201cdemocracy by coincidence\u201d). It is worth emphasizing that none of the main critics of Professors Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page\u2019s study substantially under\u00admine their conclusion that the United States is a \u201cdemocracy by coincidence.\u201d See, e.g., Peter K. Enns, Relative Policy Support and Coincidental Representation, 13 Persp. on Pol. 1053, 1058\u201361 (2015) (conceding \u201c[c]oincidental representation appears to be the norm,\u201d but rejecting the conclusion that this comes \u201cat the expense of those in the middle\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhat then would happen if one sought to create a system of political accountability the hard way\u2014by seeking to increase informed political participation? The relationship between electoral participation and democratic accountability is certainly complex. Still, the necessity of a threshold level of representative political participation\u2014including on election day\u2014is indisputable. No one, not even the authors of the APSA Report, denies that participation of citizens is necessary for account\u00adability.[footnote]See APSA Report, supra note 54, at 76 (\u201cIt is only at the polls that a party can be held finally accountable for its promises and its deeds. And it is through the act of election to a greater extent than through anything else that more widespread popular participation may be achieved in the political process.\u201d).[\/footnote] In fact, the APSA Report identified the \u201c<em>failure to bring about adequate popular participation in politics<\/em>\u201d as one of the two \u201cconspicuous failings\u201d of the two political parties.[footnote]Id. at 25 (emphasis added); see also id. at 30, 76 (arguing low voter turnout \u201cis the result of disappointment as well as inertia\u201d and that \u201c[m]ore significant operation of the party system would create greater interest in voting\u201d but also in party membership).[\/footnote] The primary dispute, therefore, turns on whether it is possible to create an informed electorate.[footnote]See generally Michael X. Delli Carpini, The Psychology of Civic Learning, <em>in<\/em> The Political Psychology of Democratic Citizenship 23, 23\u201351 (Eugene Borgida et al. eds., 2009) (arguing for the integration of five different research models to advance our understanding of political knowledge and for future research to focus on how institutions as well as social and psychological processes affect knowledge acquisition); Michael Henderson, Issue Publics, Campaigns, and Political Knowledge, 36 Pol.

J. Pol. Sci. 266, 266\u201367 (2006) (revisiting the question whether there is \u201ca permanent information underclass\u201d in U.S. politics).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIndividual voters may not be capable of monitoring elected officials to hold them accountable,[footnote]See, e.g., Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 167 (\u201cThe party-in-the-electorate faces intractable collective action problems that prevent it from acting on its own initiative.\u201d)[\/footnote] but the same is not necessarily true for organized voters.[footnote]See, e.g., Robert D. Putnam, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community 344\u201347 (2000) (reviewing evidence that communities with strong civic associations both demand and get better government); Robert D. Putnam, Bowling Alone: America\u2019s Declining Social Capital, 6 J. Democracy 65, 66 (1995) (\u201cThe norms and networks of civic engagement also powerfully affect the performance of representative government.\u201d).[\/footnote] It is no accident that federal policy is highly solicitous of the needs of older Americans; they succeed in asserting their interests because they are more politically active and better organized than most Americans.[footnote]See, e.g., Hacker &amp; Pierson, supra note 81, at 77\u201379 (2005); see also Jacob S. Hacker et al., Inequality and Public Policy, <em>in<\/em> Inequality and American Democracy: What We Know and What We Need to Learn 156, 189 (Lawrence R. Jacobs &amp; Theda Skocpol eds., 2005); Suzanne Mettler, The Transformed Welfare State and the Redistribution of Political Voice, <em>in<\/em> The Transformation of American Politics: Activist Government and the Rise of Conservatism 191, 211 (Paul Pierson &amp; Theda Skocpol eds., 2007). Similarly, gun-rights supporters who are members of the National Rifle Association (NRA) are notably more politically active than gun owners who do not belong to the NRA. Some 46% of gun owners in the NRA say they have contacted a public official to express their opinion on gun policy, including 24% who have done so in the past 12 months. Far fewer gun owners who do not belong to the NRA have reached out to a public official regarding gun policy: only 15% have ever done this, and just 5% have done this in the past 12 months. Kim Parker, Among Gun Owners, NRA Members Have a Unique Set of Views and Experiences, Pew Research Ctr. (July 5, 2017), http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2017\/07\/\r\n05\/among-gun-owners-nra-members-have-a-unique-set-of-views-and-experiences\/ [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/M2FQ-C6PS].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNew possibilities arise when one resists the urge to overstate the implications of the data supporting voter ignorance.[footnote]See Martin Gilens et al., The Mass Media and the Public\u2019s Assessment of Presidential Candidates, 1952\u20132000, 69 J. Pol. 1160, 1173 (2007) (\u201c[F]ocus[ing] on trends in Americans\u2019 knowledge and evaluations of presidential candidates for the public taken as a whole\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. may obscure important variation across subgroups of the public.\u201d). In this regard, it is important to acknowledge the ways in which theory shapes research agendas. Most studies of differential voter knowledge are predicated on the assumption that knowledge is the springboard to participation, not the inverse. It is, thus, not an accident that polls on differential knowledge among voters rarely ask about the partisan associa\u00adtions to which such individuals belong, let alone whether those individuals have been con\u00adtacted by partisan networks. See, e.g., Michael Dimock et al., Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology 93\u201398 (2014), http:\/\/assets.pewresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\r\n\/5\/2014\/06\/6-26-14-Political-Typology-release1.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/E34E-58UZ].[\/footnote]While voter igno\u00adrance is certainly pervasive, it need not preclude a path to political accountability in which informed political participation plays a critical role. That route, however, becomes visible only when one puts social ties and membership organizations back into the picture.[footnote]Compare Bruce E. Cain, Democracy More or Less: America\u2019s Political Quandary 11, 16 (2015) (emphasizing voter ignorance as an explanation for why \u201cpopular sover\u00adeignty\u201d is an \u201cillusion\u201d and why we must return to a pluralistic approach to politics in which democratic accountability is achieved through democratic competition between interest groups and political parties), with infra section II.B (arguing that social ties, relationships, and associations play a vital role in political mobilization and engagement).[\/footnote] A substantial body of empirical work supports the hypothesis that intermediary associations, including political parties, can spur political participation and facilitate a two-way street of communication between elites and ordinary citizens.[footnote]See infra section II.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAn associational path to responsive and accountable party govern\u00adance emerges from this empirical evidence demonstrating the critically important role that association and associations play in mobilizing and informing citizens. It capitalizes on the fact that, as Professor Daniel Lowenstein has astutely remarked, \u201cthe term \u2018party\u2019 can be and is used with greatly disparate referents.\u201d[footnote]Lowenstein, supra note 122, at 1760.[\/footnote] While responsible party government adopted a relatively formalist conception of the party as its officers, the associational-party path exploits the sociological fact that the contempo\u00adrary party organization is a network of individuals and groups connected formally and informally in their efforts to influence elections and government policy.[footnote]See, e.g., Masket, supra note 38, at 19, 45 (noting \u201cthe shape of the modern party is more of a network than a machine hierarchy\u201d while emphasizing its focus on shared electoral goals); Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 143 (noting the \u201cdiversity of motiva\u00adtions and interests\u201d of partisan actors but emphasizing their broader \u201coverlapping political goals\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFrom an associational-party perspective, the relevant definition of a political party is a sociological one in which \u201c[t]he term \u2018party\u2019 is a colloquial shorthand to describe\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. <em>a loose collection of political relation\u00adships<\/em>, some legal and some non-legal, among a diverse set of actors and institutions, all of whom perform important work in furtherance of a common [electoral, policy, and ideological] agenda.\u201d[footnote]Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 133 (emphasis added).[\/footnote] The party network certainly includes the well-known trinity of elected officials (also known as \u201cthe party in office or seeking office\u201d); \u201cparty activists,\u201d including paid party operatives and volunteers; and voters (\u201cthe party in the electorate\u201d).[footnote]Larry J. Sabato, The Party\u2019s Just Begun: Shaping Political Parties for America\u2019s Future 26\u201327 (1988).[\/footnote] But it is significantly broader, including not only legislative caucuses[footnote]For an interesting account of congressional membership organizations and their success in pooling resources and disciplining members in the quest for donations and power, see generally Andrew J. Clarke, Party Sub-Brands and American Party Factions (2017) (unpublished working paper), http:\/\/www.andrewjclarke.net\/uploads\/2\/8\/0\/2\/\r\n28027431\/party_sub-brands_and_american_party_factions__clarke_.pdf (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] but also nonparty entities and policy demanders such as the AFL-CIO, Club for Growth, and NRA.[footnote]Some political scientists exclude these partisan civic associations from their definition. See, e.g., Richard Skinner et al., 527 Committees, Formal Parties, and Party Adaptation, 11 Forum 137, 144 (2013) (distinguishing between 527s that are \u201cdeeply embedded within the formal party structure[]\u201d and subservient to their partisan goals, and certain policy-demanding groups, such as Club for Growth or Planned Parenthood, which while \u201cgenerally aligned with a party\u201d are not \u201cautomatically subservient to th[e] party\u2019s desires\u201d). Donors, which most political scientists include within the definition, however, are also not \u201cautomatically subservient\u201d to the party, so it is not entirely satisfactory to treat the two groups differently as some definitions do. Id.[\/footnote] As Professor Michael Kang summarizes:\r\n<blockquote>Beyond a party\u2019s nominees or titular officials (such as the party chairman, spokespeople, and employees), the party comprises\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a teeming, polyarchic aggregation of politically interested constituents. The kaleidoscopic mass of political activists, volunteers, financial contributors, interest groups, PACs, lawyers, consultants, journalists, and intellectuals who perform important work aligned with the party\u2019s collective agenda are not necessarily bound formally to or paid by the official party.[footnote]Kang, Hydraulics, supra note 37, at 143.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe sociological perspective further recognizes that elected officials and party leaders operate within the confines of the official party organiza\u00adtion only when it suits their interests.[footnote]Id. at 147, 158 (noting an early instance in which Wisconsin political parties\u2014in response to Progressive-era reforms\u2014transformed themselves into civic associations and explaining how this shift into an informal network pushed \u201cstrategic behavior\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. deeper into the quiet background of politics\u201d); see also Skinner et al., supra note 141, at 141 (arguing that 527s emerged as an adaptation within the party network to accommodate the legislative ban on soft money and providing as evidence that the \u201cbest-connected 527s tend[ed] to have a high[er] percentage of employees who ha[d] also worked for formal party organizations and top presidential campaigns\u201d).[\/footnote] The legal entities of campaign finance are largely window dressing, even as the formal rights of such entities can and do reshape the texture of partisan networks.[footnote]The Obama campaign\u2019s concerted effort to obscure the existence of different legal entities by naming them such that they could all be referred to by the same acro\u00adnym\u2014\u201cOFA\u201d\u2014nicely illustrates this point.

Gibson et al., Assessing Party Organizational Strength, 27 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 193, 199\u2013201 (1983) (describing the division of labor in and professionalization of state party organizations between 1960 and 1980).[\/footnote] The era of nineteenth-century urban machine politics that depended on the confluence of relatively strong personal ties and a formal organization bound by patronage is long gone.[footnote]See McKenna &amp; Han, supra note 144, at 26\u201330 (describing the demise of local parties centered around ward and precinct workers who maintained personal connections with voters precisely in order to create a sense of indebtedness that would be paid on elec\u00adtion day). For a vivid history of nineteenth-century political parties, see generally Jean H. Baker, Affairs of Party (1983) (exploring the \u201cparty experience\u201d of mid-nineteenth-century Democrats); Gerald Leonard, The Invention of Party Politics (2002) (examining political parties in the early nineteenth century).[\/footnote] Yet, even in the twenty-first century, political parties remain networks of individuals and groups\u2014activists, donors, officeholders, and dealmakers\u2014tied together and to the electorate by social connections of various strengths.[footnote]Masket, supra note 38, at 19, 108\u201358 (depicting, vividly, the various associational qualities of these networks in California).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBeyond their capacity to act as vehicles for aggregating and amplify\u00ading preferences and perspectives, the formal parties have an associational life, although there is great variation in the depth and breadth of that life. The national committees of the two major political parties, for exam\u00adple, largely function as vessels through which to collect and distribute donations. Like other tertiary associations based in Washington, D.C., they are professionally managed and donor funded.[footnote]Compare Daniel J. Galvin, The Transformation of Political Institutions: Investments in Institutional Resources and Gradual Change in the National Party Committees, 26 Stud. Am. Pol. Dev. 50, 50\u201353 (2012) (describing the transition to \u201cparties in service\u201d), with Mark E. Warren, Democracy and Association 39 (2001) (describing ter\u00adtiary associations as professionally run membership-based interest groups funded by foundations or other donors, rather than by membership dues).[\/footnote] Their professional staffs are selected for their strong ties to elected officials and donors.[footnote]Cf. Gregory Koger et al., Partisan Webs: Information Exchange and Party Networks, 39 Brit. J. Pol. Sci. 633, 652 (2009) (finding \u201cformal party organizations tend to be information receivers\u201d that collect potential-donor and -voter lists from interest groups and partisan-affiliated media sources); Emily Cahn, DSCC Announces 2016 Staff, Roll Call (Nov. 21, 2014), http:\/\/www.rollcall.com\/news\/home\/dscc-announces-2016-staff-roster [http:\/\/perma.cc\/KMD5-CXUU] (introducing the 2016 members of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, many of whom had strong ties to the incoming DSCC chairman).[\/footnote] The primary interaction these committees have with the broader public is through membership donations, with at least some emphasis on small donors\u2014both because it is to their electoral advantage to do so and because federal law constrains their ability to solicit big donations.[footnote]Cf. Kenneth P. Vogel et al., Hillary\u2019s Cash Flow Issue: Red Flags in Finance Reports for Clinton, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Politico (Oct. 16, 2015), http:\/\/\r\nwww.politico.com\/story\/2015\/10\/hillary-clinton-fec-filing-cash-flow-problem-214870 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/R2PF-ENK7] (recognizing that Hillary Clinton\u2019s big donors were quickly maxing out and recommending that she \u201csignificantly expand her fundraising base to include more small donors, who can\u2014and usually do\u2014continue giving throughout the race\u201d).[\/footnote] Small donations do not necessarily lead to social interaction with party elites. Even so, such entities are able to collect money only because they are situated within a partisan social network capable of mobilizing voters on election day. Other nodes within the formal party operate more like the parties of the nineteenth century. Organizations like the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) remain participatory and federated, and they regularly bridge ties between party elites and activists.[footnote]See Democratic National Committee\u20142016, Democracy in Action, http:\/\/\r\nwww.p2016.org\/parties\/dnc16.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/FCH4-VKCE] (last visited Jan. 17, 2018) (listing the members of the DNC and their diverse backgrounds and affiliations).[\/footnote] Super donors, meanwhile, operate in insular social and professional networks; their strong ties to one another enhance both their ability to fundraise and their access to party leaders.[footnote]Cf. Nicholas Confessore et al., The Families Funding the 2016 Presidential Election, N.Y. Times (Oct. 10, 2015), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2015\/10\/11\/\r\nus\/politics\/2016-presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (noting that \u201cacross party lines, [super donors] are patrons of the same symphonies, art museums or at-risk youth pro\u00adgrams,\u201d that they are \u201cbusiness partners, in-laws and, on occasion, even poker buddies,\u201d and that they frequently have pre-existing \u201cpersonal, regional and professional ties to the candidates\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe picture is equally complicated at the local level. While some local party organizations are well integrated with membership-based associations, such as labor unions, churches, and firefighter and law enforcement organizations, others are dominated by business interests and socially insulated from district constituencies.[footnote]See, e.g., Masket, supra note 38, at 14, 119\u201320, 180\u201384 (depicting local party net\u00adworks and their variations).[\/footnote] The power of the latter derives from the money that they provide to bankroll candidates rather than from the social networks they are capable of tapping on election day.[footnote]Id. at 182\u201383 (noting local party leaders, as business leaders, \u201caren\u2019t well known by rank-and-file primary voters;\u201d instead, their political power derives from \u201cthe funding advantage they provide\u201d to candidates).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWed to responsible party government and conceiving of parties narrowly and almost exclusively <em>as ideological speakers<\/em>, party reformers have been blind to the democratic potential arising out of the associational diversity within the partisan network. This blindness has prevented systematic consideration of both the part association can play in mobilizing and informing citizens and the ways that building out the associational life of contemporary political parties\u2014by shoring up those nodes of the partisan network capable of fostering social ties between elected officials and activists and between activists and constituents\u2014could contribute to good governance.\r\n<h3>B. The Democratic Returns of a Party\u2019s Associational Life<\/h3>\r\nWith a clearer sense of what is being proposed, it is time to review the empirical evidence demonstrating the critically important role that association and associations play in mobilizing and informing citizens. The existence of an associational path to responsive party governance derives from marrying the insight that contemporary political parties retain significant associational qualities with two relatively uncontrover\u00adsial empirical findings pointing to the significant political returns of those associational qualities. First, social ties, far more than ideological commitment, drive civic and political participation.[footnote]See infra notes 158\u2013166 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Second, infor\u00admation travels best through social networks.[footnote]See infra notes 182\u2013183 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe drivers of political participation are unquestionably multi\u00adfaceted, with time, money, education, civic skills, and political interest all playing significant roles.[footnote]See generally Henry H. Brady et al., Beyond SES: A Resource Model of Political Participation, 89 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 271, 271 (1995) [hereinafter Brady et al., Beyond SES] (identifying time, money, civic skills, political interest, and recruitment through social networks as the dominant explanations of individual political participation, based on a review of the literature).[\/footnote] Still, one finding emerges time and again: Individuals who are asked to engage civically and politically are far more likely to do so than those who are not.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, Friends, Associates, and Associations, supra note 32, at 80\u201385 (reviewing the empirical literature on this point). See generally Sidney Verba et al., Voice and Equality: Civic Voluntarism in American Politics 3\u20134 (1995) (finding \u201c[t]hose who have both the motivation and the capacity to become active are more likely to do so if they are asked,\u201d and further that motivation and capacity arise out of the social experiences, institutions, and associations to which individuals are exposed).[\/footnote] A recent inquiry into the drivers of participation in state politics, for example, found that \u201ccontact from the political parties and other organizations\u201d was \u201cespecially important in motivating participation in state politics.\u201d[footnote]Andrea McAtee &amp; Jennifer Wolak, Why People Decide to Participate in State Politics, 64 Pol. Res. Q. 45, 52 (2011) (using survey data from the 1990 American Citizen Participation Study to assess the drivers of political participation).[\/footnote] In doing so, it noted further that the organizational strength of state and local parties shaped the time and effort of those activated (a point to which this Essay will return later).[footnote]Id. at 51\u201352.[\/footnote] In this regard, it should not be surprising that a key attribute of nonvoters is that they have not been asked to vote.[footnote]See Benjamin Highton &amp; Raymond E. Wolfinger, The Political Implications of Higher Turnout, 31 Brit. J. Pol. Sci. 179, 188 (2001) (finding nonvoters had not been \u201cpolitically mobilized,\u201d defined as having been \u201ccanvassed either by telephone or in per\u00adson\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nRelationships and social networks, far more than ideology and belief, drive political recruitment and sustain political activism.[footnote]See Brady et al., Beyond SES, supra note 157, at 285 (concluding that \u201cmotiva\u00adtions such as interest in politics are not enough to explain political participation\u201d); Valerie A.

Res. 331, 340 (2013) (finding \u201cthose who attend religious services more often are more likely to engage in civic activities and infor\u00admal helping not because of beliefs, politics, or general sociability, but because they have strong religious social networks\u201d); Doug McAdam, Recruitment to High-Risk Activism: The Case of Freedom Summer, 92 Am. J.

J. Soc. 640, 654, 659 (1993) (revising his earlier study to address prior limitations and concluding that continued contact with activist friends from the Civil Rights movement sustained activism and political engagement over the long term).[\/footnote] Existing social ties frequently explain who is likely to be asked in the first place.[footnote]See, e.g., Florence Passy, Social Networks Matter. But How?, <em>in<\/em> Social Movements and Networks: Relational Approaches to Collective Action 21, 24, 34 (Mario Diani &amp; Doug McAdam eds., 2003) (reviewing literature showing that a primary path by which individu\u00adals disposed to take political action are connected to opportunities to do so is through social ties).[\/footnote] In fact, the seminal study found individuals are most likely to be recruited by individuals whom they know from civic associations.[footnote]Verba et al., supra note 158, at 144 (finding Americans were more likely to be recruited into politics by associates from civic and political groups).[\/footnote] Equally important, those who are asked are much more likely to accept the invitations to take political action if they are asked by someone they know.[footnote]Id. at 142\u201345 (analyzing when requests are likely to be accepted and finding the existence of a personal relationship to make it significantly more likely that the invitation is accepted); Henry E.

Soc. 1360, 1376 (1973) (\u201cWeak ties are more likely to link members of <em>different<\/em> small groups than are strong ones, which tend to be concentrated within particular groups.\u201d); see also Bob Edwards &amp; John D.

This effect is influenced by the strength of the personal ties involved. Strong personal connections, in particular, frequently explain the choice to engage in time-consuming, sustained, risky, or expensive endeavors.[footnote]See, e.g., McAdam, supra note 162, at 70, 81\u201382 (finding individuals more likely to engage in high-risk activism when they have stronger social ties to the those involved).[\/footnote] Thus, even party activists turn out to stay engaged because of the friendships and social contacts associated with the work.[footnote]Rosenblum, Primus Inter Pares, supra note 55, at 503 (noting \u201c[s]tudies indicate that activists who became engaged for issue-related reasons come to find\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. social gratifi\u00adcation\u201d a primary motivation for staying involved with the party because they are \u201crewarded with \u2018social contacts and friendship,\u2019 the \u2018fun and excitement of politics,\u2019 and the \u2018feeling of recognition in the community\u2019\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPoliticians know well the electoral value of personal ties and social networks. For much of the twentieth century, the Republican National Committee cultivated personal networks of activists to broaden its electoral base.[footnote]Galvin, supra note 148, at 61, 64 (describing the success of the RNC\u2019s efforts to create \u201ca \u2018sustaining membership\u2019 small-donor program that mobilized local volunteers to \u2018fish\u2019 for new donors among their neighbors\u201d).[\/footnote] In the 1950s, for example, it trained women on how to converse with their neighbors in order to facilitate fundraising.[footnote]Id. at 64 (describing the RNC\u2019s efforts to \u201ctrain[] Republican women in the art of grassroots mobilization\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s ground game depended on 2.2 million volunteers to canvass among friends and neighbors, equipped with both their own local knowledge and a list of persuadable voters generated by the state-of-the-art analytics developed at headquarters.[footnote]See McKenna &amp; Han, supra note 144, at viii\u2013x, 12\u201313, 92 (noting the degree to which those who campaigned for Obama stayed involved because of the relationships they forged during the campaign). By way of comparison, John Kerry\u2019s 2004 field operation, which was generally considered \u201cwell executed,\u201d consisted of approximately 700,000 (paid and volunteer) individuals. Id. at 39.[\/footnote] Tellingly, the primary task assigned to paid staffers was to train local volunteers to use personal narratives to persuade neighbors and friends to vote for Obama on election day.[footnote]See, e.g., id. at 73\u201375, 80, 105 (noting the metric of success for paid organizers was relationship building rather than the number of voter contacts and illustrating this campaign approach in various places, including in the 2008 Pennsylvania primary).[\/footnote] In 2012, when faced with polls showing that a substantial percentage of his 2008 supporters were wavering, Obama extended this strategy to the virtual world, using social media, not just neighborhood geography, to identify social ties that could be harnessed.[footnote]Jim Rutenberg, Data You Can Believe In, N.Y.

People may have joined the campaign because of Obama\u2019s opposition to the war in Iraq or his stance on gender equality, but, as many of our interviewees told us, they put long, thankless hours into the field because of their relationships with others.[footnote]Id. at 91\u201392. The authors further note that 75% of their interviewees emphasized the importance of the campaign\u2019s human presence, id. at 92, and that these interpersonal connections existed at three levels: \u201camong the field staff themselves, between the field organizer and the volunteer, and between the volunteer who performed voter contact and his or her neighbor,\u201d id. at 91.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nThe Obama campaign was neither the first, nor the last, presidential campaign to harness personal ties to achieve electoral ends.

J. Soc. 702, 730 (2007) (noting public health officials understand that information, unless socially reinforced, will generally not change entrenched, risky behaviors).[\/footnote] Tea Party activists at the grassroots level have consciously exploited this fact, having made a concerted effort to ensure that the political information they wish to disseminate to the broader electorate arrives through trusted sources.[footnote]Theda Skocpol &amp; Vanessa Williamson, The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism 128\u201329 (2012) (describing how the Tea Party took advantage of the well-known sociological fact \u201cthat citizens find news more credible if trusted people vouch for its veracity and relevance\u201d).[\/footnote] Both Facebook\u2019s \u201clike\u201d function and Twitter are predicated on this dynamic.\r\n\r\nIn sum, there is strong evidence that association itself\u2014that is, personal ties, weak and strong\u2014can play at least two critical roles in the democratic process: First, social ties are capable of drawing citizens into politics, including those that are not terribly interested in politics, merely on the strength of the friendship. Second, they are efficient vectors when it comes to information transmission. These dynamics, moreover, are likely to be quite familiar to many of us: the discovery of the risks that the shortage of large-animal vets poses to our food supply learned from a college-age babysitter, the novel read based on a friend\u2019s recommenda\u00adtion, or the campaign house party attended because the host is a family friend.\r\n<h3>C. Party Strength\u2014Envisioning the Shape of a Responsive Party System<\/h3>\r\nThe heavy theoretical lifting that remains is an exploration of the implications of this empirical research for strengthening the political parties in the interest of responsive and accountable governance. First, what can we infer from this empirical research about the shape partisan networks would need take to yield democratic returns? Equally important, is it possible to nudge parties in that direction under current sociopolitical conditions? Ultimately, the remaining two sections of this Part aim to explain how a party-reform agenda tailored to broadening and strengthening the associational life of political parties could improve policy responsiveness notwithstanding what we know about the myriad sources of electoral dysfunction today.[footnote]For an overview of some of the salient dynamics that increasingly render elections incapable of tethering elected officials to the preferences of their constituents, see generally Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1151\u201357, 1161\u201374.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n1. <em>The Shape of Partisan Networks<\/em>. \u2014 Without denying that the causes of our crisis in representation are numerous, an associational path to responsible party governance takes as its starting point a significantly under\u00adappreciated transformation of the political landscape: the increas\u00ading social isolation of political elites and its impact on both participation and the flow of political information between ordinary Americans and their leaders.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the social networks of political elites today and those in prior eras of American history is both stark and revealing. While democratic politics is frequently a contest among elites,[footnote]The notion that democratic politics has long consisted of a contest among elites is the primary insight of the pluralist tradition of American politics, even as key figures within the tradition differ over how impenetrable elite power is. See generally Robert A. Dahl, Who Governs? Democracy and Power in an American City (1st ed. 1961); C. Wright Mills, The Power Elite (1st ed. 1956); E.E. Schattsneider, The Semisovereign People: A Realist\u2019s View of Democracy in America 35 (2d ed. 1975).[\/footnote] prior to the advent of mass media, candidates needed \u201cto build extensive interper\u00adsonal networks not confined to particular occupational or social circles\u201d to garner reputation and votes.[footnote]Theda Skocpol, Diminished Democracy: From Membership to Management in American Civic Life 113 (2004).[\/footnote] As such, the path to political power ran through membership in socioeconomically integrated civic associa\u00adtions\u2014the Shriners, the Rotary Club, the American Legion.[footnote]Id. at 108\u201313 (noting \u201cinvolvement in cross-class membership federations\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. contributed to U.S. electoral campaigns and helped democratic politicians to legitimate their aspirations for governmental leadership\u201d).[\/footnote] These groups required regular attendance at meetings and frequently involved election to higher offices and attendance at federated meetings.[footnote]Id. at 78\u201379, 85\u201393.[\/footnote] Political elites were thereby prevented from becoming socially insulated from the rest of American society.[footnote]See id. at 110 (noting further that biographies of prominent businessmen, politi\u00adcians, and professionals and their wives often involved long accounts of their membership in the same civic associations that record numbers of ordinary Americans joined as well).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBy contrast, electoral incentives today pull candidates and parties into a narrow social network of extremely unrepresentative and socially isolated donors and activists.[footnote]Cf.

In 2014, the aver\u00adage cost of a successful House bid was just over $1.4 million while an average Senate bid cost nearly $ 9.7 million.

Political commentator Michael Lind only slightly overstates the case when he writes:\r\n<blockquote>Politicians chosen by membership-based mass parties have been replaced by politicians selected by donors and sold\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to voters.

A behavioral economist might describe this in terms of the availability heuristic; an anthropologist might describe it in terms of culture and social practice. The bottom line, however, is the same: Social context shapes what one prioritizes (e.g., tax cuts or social security), finds reasonable (e.g., accepting extravagant gifts from donors or engaging in an illicit market to make ends meet), and perceives as being problematic (e.g., what constitutes sexual harassment or racism).[footnote]See Carnes, White-Collar Government, supra note 197, at 89\u201391.[\/footnote] No amount of data or polling can compensate for the fact that polls are written by the very elites whose world experiences are increasingly insular.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe associational life of partisan elites inevitably affects responsiveness and accountability. The absence of consideration of this phenomenon by responsible party government theorists can probably be attributed to the fact that through the 1950s, elected officials and party leaders had robust ties to their constituents through membership associations based on socioeconomic status (if not race or gender).[footnote]See, e.g., Noah Feldman, Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR\u2019s Great Supreme Court Justices 51\u201359 (2010) (discussing the relationship of the Klan to Southern politics).[\/footnote] Churches, veterans\u2019 groups, and even the Ku Klux Klan in the South were extremely well integrated into the party network.[footnote]See, e.g., id. (noting various social networks\u2019 influence on Southern politics in the early- and mid-twentieth century); Skocpol, supra note 186, at 110\u201313 (describing associational memberships of political elites).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe optimal partisan network, it follows, is one with both socioeco\u00adnomic and intergenerational breadth <em>and<\/em> interpersonal depth.[footnote]This Essay does not affirmatively argue for racially integrated partisan networks. This is for two reasons. First, incorporating younger voters and increasing socioeconomic diversity will inevitably increase racial and ethnic diversity in those regions that are diverse. Younger Americans appear to operate in much more diverse social contexts\u2014at least at work\u2014than older Americans. Skocpol &amp; Williamson, supra note 183, at 72\u201373. Second, the goal of racial integration is politically and normatively charged, arguably itself polariz\u00ading. In fact, on one view, the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan of the Donald Trump campaign reflected, at least partially, a nostalgia for a period when there was less racial integration. See Dan Balz, How the Republican Party Created Donald Trump, Wash. Post (Mar. 5, 2016), http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/behind-the-rise-of-trump-long-standing-grievances-among-left-out-voters\/2016\/03\/05\/7996bca2-e253-11e5-9c36-e1902f6\r\nb6571_story.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (\u201cBeyond economic issues, Trump has tapped fears about a changing America, a country that is increasingly diverse and culturally tolerant.\u201d).[\/footnote] Such a political organization would be more capable of mobilizing voters of all ages through a broad cadre of party activists with ties to a representative electorate. It would be better able to disseminate political information during and between elections.\r\n\r\nThe vital link in developing strong parties is the \u201cparty faithful\u201d\u2014defined to include volunteers for campaigns, staff of state and local parties, and activists involved with groups such as Indivisible, the Tea Party, the National Right to Life, or the Sierra Club.[footnote]Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 195.[\/footnote] Such activists are much more likely to be the neighbors of ordinary people.[footnote]Id. at 179, 205 (arguing that \u201cin crucial ways the party faithful are more like ordi\u00adnary voters than party elites\u201d which makes them \u201cuniquely positioned to convey some of the concerns of ordinary voters to party leaders and campaign operatives\u201d).[\/footnote] As a result, they are exceptionally well positioned to mobilize and inform others.[footnote]Regrettably, McKenna and Han do not explore either the effects of the Obama campaign\u2019s community organizing on the knowledge base of contacted Obama voters or whether the activist network it built subsequently influenced the policies of the administra\u00adtion. See McKenna &amp; Han, supra note 144. This gap is typical of the literature, which assumes knowledge precedes participation. For example, the vast literature on the ways that union membership significantly increases political participation, especially for those with the fewest pre-existing resources, such as educational attainment, rarely addresses the political knowledge among such union members separately. See generally Jasmine Kerrissey &amp; Evan Schofer, Union Membership and Political Participation in the United States, 91 Soc. Forces 895 (2013) (examining the effect of union membership on civic and political participation in the late twentieth century in the United States). Similarly, the literature on the effects of face-to-face contact from campaigns for purposes of voter mobilization almost exclusively measures behavior (not knowledge) as the outcome measure. See, e.g., David Broockman &amp; Joshua Kalla, Durably Reducing Transphobia: A Field Experiment on Door-to-Door Canvassing, 352 Science 220, 223\u201324 (2016) (finding signifi\u00adcant and durable persuasive effects from face-to-face canvassing by strangers on attitudes toward transgender individuals).[\/footnote] Even beyond the basic influence of personal ties on recruitment and information transmission, evidence indicates that ordinary citizens have devised their own ways to get \u201c[political] information on the cheap\u201d: They turn to \u201cpolitically knowledgeable individuals\u201d within their social networks\u2014preferably, but <em>not exclusively<\/em>, those \u201cwho hold compatible political biases.\u201d[footnote]Robert Huckfeldt, The Social Communication of Political Expertise, 45 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 425, 426, 437 (2001). Huckfeldt specifically notes that \u201cthe perception of political disagreement produces a relatively minor and inconsequential effect on the perception of expertise\u201d among friends and associates with whom one has in-person conversations. Id. This study was based on a network analysis of a large sample of residents of Indiana and Missouri, and it objectively verified the expertise of alleged experts. Id. at 427\u201328.[\/footnote] The strategy works because people, it turns out, are relatively good judges of actual expertise, and political junkies have a knack for clearly communicating their political knowledge.[footnote]Id. at 436.[\/footnote] Unsurprisingly, individuals are more likely to be drawn into politics if their social networks include persons with political expertise.[footnote]Ronald La Due Lake &amp; Robert Huckfeldt, Social Capital, Social Networks, and Political Participation, 19 Pol. Psychol. 567, 579 (1998) (reporting that \u201cas political exper\u00adtise within the [social] network increases, so does individual involvement in politics\u201d and that this effect is discernable apart from both individual-level capacity and individual-level participation in civic organizations).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSuch a partisan network\u2014one in which volunteers, rather than donors, take the lead\u2014is significantly more likely to facilitate the two-way street of communication and to tie elected officials to the concerns and experiences of their electoral base.[footnote]Cf.

(describing failed efforts to communicate to headquarters information learned about voters by union activists).[\/footnote] Such intelligence can compensate for top-down efforts to collect information when it proves inaccurate.[footnote]Cf.

See Nancy L. Rosenblum, On the Side of Angels: An Appreciation of Parties and Partisanship 47 (2008) (observing that one advantage of single-party and anti-pluralist regimes over dynastic or military dictatorships is the party\u2019s ability to function as a channel of communication with party activists, helping party leaders to keep track of the demands of the masses).[\/footnote] And the best evidence of this is the fact that the heyday of membership-based routes to political power was also the New Deal period during which federal policy was significantly more attentive to the needs of middle-class Americans.[footnote]Cf. Bartels, supra note 21, at 12\u201315 &amp; fig.1.4 (arguing that current levels of income inequality rival those of the Roaring Twenties and are the consequence of political choices, and implicitly contrasting the current economic state to the relative income equality during the New Deal period); Skocpol, supra note 186, at 108\u201313 (describing social integration of political figures in the mid-twentieth century).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2. <em>Opportunities and Constraints in the Reshaping of Partisan Networks.\u00a0<\/em>\u2014 Success, unquestionably, depends on diversifying the party faithful.

Certainly, the unelected operatives, whose power is exercised within the formal party, are likely to be wary of broad mobilization. Their power derives from their control over the nomination process, which in turn depends on low voter turnout in low-information primaries.[footnote]Cf. Masket, supra note 38, at 46\u201347 (arguing the informal party organizations that control nominations today, like the party machines of bygone times, depend on low voter turnout during the primary election to consolidate their power because their ability to effectively determine the outcome of the primary depends on predictability).[\/footnote] Ideologi\u00adcal activists, meanwhile, will have their own reasons to resist undertakings that would increase responsiveness to constituents\u2019 interests and preferences.[footnote]Where the electorate is more moderate than the ideological policy demanders, such groups may fear broader mobilization will undercut their policy goals. Perhaps the most salient example is the NRA, whose leadership is known to have much more expansive views of gun rights than either Republicans generally or its own members. For example, the NRA has been known to advocate behind the scenes for legislation permitting the mentally ill to purchase guns even as \u201clarge majorities of [Republican gun-owning] NRA members and nonmembers alike favor barring gun purchases by\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the mentally ill.\u201d Parker, supra note 132 (noting \u201csignificant differences in policy views between Republican gun owners who say they belong to the NRA and those who don\u2019t\u201d and offering as an example that while only 52% of Republican NRA members support \u201cback\u00adground checks for private gun sales,\u201d 75% of Republican nonmembers do so); see also Alan Judd, NRA Push on Mental Health: Solution or Diversion?, Atlanta J.-Const.

Renewed political engagement combined with heightened levels of concern for the state of our democratic institutions provide a window of opportunity and, as such, an appropriate nudge from the Supreme Court could go a long way toward putting us on a path to a more responsive and accountable political order.\r\n<h3>D. Assessing the Likelihood of Success<\/h3>\r\nThe most important question, of course, is whether an associational focus would work. Given the various dysfunctions of American politics today, what reasons are there to believe that regrounding political elites in the broader electorate while extending representative and informed political participation would, in fact, improve democratic policy responsiveness? Even a sympathetic reader might ask how strengthening the associational life of political parties would make a difference given the incentives that push elected officials to cater to primary voters and wealthy donors in a world of uncompetitive elections. Moreover, assum\u00ading an associational focus could work, shouldn\u2019t we be worried that peer-to-peer engagement will make polarization even worse? The party faithful are known to be ideologically extreme.[footnote]See, e.g., Pew Research Ctr., Partisanship and Political Animosity in 2016, at 14, 34, 44, 53 (2016) [hereinafter Pew Research Ctr., Partisanship and Political Animosity], http:\/\/www.people-press.org\/2016\/06\/22\/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/G9MX-8FYA] (noting high levels of agreement with the positions of their own party and hostility toward members of the other party among respondents who are \u201chighly engaged in politics,\u201d defined as \u201cthose who nearly always vote and have either donated money or volunteered for a campaign in the last year\u201d).[\/footnote] Shouldn\u2019t we, therefore, worry that this approach will exacerbate polarization and further ease the spread of misinformation and damaging populist rhetoric?\r\n\r\nThese are all valid concerns. The relevant question, however, is: How do the potential obstacles to an associational-party path compare with the known ones under responsible party government? By that measure, the associational-party path is a clear winner. Given the failures of responsi\u00adble party government, an associational approach presents the only viable way to induce responsible government. Before making that case, however, it is important to address these challenges on their own terms.\r\n\r\nFirst, how might broadening electoral participation improve demo\u00adcratic responsiveness given that it does not appear to undercut the existing incentives, which uncompetitive elections create, to cater to the preferences of wealthy donors and an ideologically extreme base of the party? It is important, first and foremost, to acknowledge that the relationship between party competition and policy responsiveness is decidedly imperfect. Efforts to increase party competition\u2014including efforts to end partisan gerrymandering\u2014are certainly worthwhile.[footnote]Currently, efforts to expand electoral competition are primarily directed at con\u00advincing the Supreme Court to hold that partisan gerrymanders are both unconstitutional and justiciable. See generally Benisek v. Lamone, 266 F. Supp. 3d 799, 801 (D. Md. 2017), (\u201c[T]he Court now\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [stays] this case pending the outcome of <em>Whitford<\/em>.\u00a0.\u00a0. . [S]uch action is necessary because the justiciability of political gerrymandering claims remains in doubt, but the Supreme Court will likely resolve or clarify this threshold jurisdictional matter in its <em>Whitford<\/em> decision.\u201d), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 543 (2017); Whitford v. Gill, 218 F. Supp. 3d 837 (W.D. Wis. 2016), stay granted, 137 S. Ct. 2289 (June 19, 2017) (staying the judgment of the district court pending resolution of an appeal). Legislative efforts to adopt nonpartisan redistricting commissions are also underway. Such efforts are most likely to succeed in states with direct democratic mechanisms.[\/footnote] Nevertheless, the fact remains that the evidence is decidedly mixed as to whether, let alone how much, party competition improves policy responsiveness.[footnote]See supra notes 98\u201399.[\/footnote] That relationship is even more attenuated when the electorate that actually turns out on election days is increasingly polarized.[footnote]Smidt, supra note 80, at 366 (\u201cPolarization limits the number of floating voters and the electoral payoff of appealing to their moderate or pragmatic concerns.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is equally important to come to terms with the fact that uncompetitive elections are, for the moment, an entrenched feature of the American electoral system. Partisan gerrymanders explain only some of the absence of party competition currently evident.[footnote]See Fred Dews, A Primer on Gerrymandering and Political Polarization, Brookings (July 6, 2017), http:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/brookings-now\/2017\/07\/06\/\r\na-primer-on-gerrymandering-and-political-polarization\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/DLT2-8TVX] (reviewing the debate about the degree to which partisan gerrymandering causes polarization and to which its end would improve electoral competition).[\/footnote] In the main, the lack of party competition is a result of ideological geographic self-sorting rather than partisan gerrymandering.[footnote]See, e.g., Drutman, supra note 7 (\u201cDemocrats and Republicans have more and more become regional parties.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. As a result, a large number of single-member House districts are going to be dominated by one party or the other\u2014no matter how the lines get drawn.\u201d); Salam &amp; Richie, supra note 26 (noting, \u201c[r]egardless of how you slice the map, the majority of Americans will live in so-called landslide districts,\u201d meaning voters who \u201cdefy stereotypes of left and right\u201d are often \u201clocked out of representation\u201d).[\/footnote] Even if the Supreme Court puts an end to partisan gerrymandering, only a limited\u2014albeit extremely important\u2014set of swing districts would be affected.[footnote]See Laura Royden &amp; Michael Li, Brennan Ctr. for Justice, Extreme Maps 1\u20132 (2017), http:\/\/www.brennancenter.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/Extreme%20Map\r\ns%205.16_0.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6C5U-ZMSJ] (identifying seven extremely gerry\u00admandered states, including swing states such as Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia); Dews, supra note 252 (endorsing the assessment that \u201cthe clustering of Americans into like-minded communities\u201d limits the likelihood that ending partisan gerrymandering will significantly increase the number of competitive legislative districts).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, while we must fight fading party competition, it is time to devise strategies to address policy responsiveness in the absence of party competition. The associational-party path\u2019s emphasis on expanding the electorate seeks to do just that. By focusing on drawing in more voters and creating a more representative electorate, it points to opportunities to radically shift electoral expectations.[footnote]Most recently, this phenomenon was seen in the Democrat Doug Jones\u2019s special-election win in solidly Republican Alabama, which was attributed to unprecedented black turnout, driven, at least in part, by civic groups within the partisan network. As reported by journalist Al Giordano on Twitter, the success was in large part the result of old-fashioned grassroots mobilization efforts by the Democratic Party and its civil-society allies. For exam\u00adple, \u201c[t]he state NAACP instructed its local branches to call every registered voter in the state who did not vote in 2016.\u201d Al Giordano (@AlGiordano), Twitter (Dec. 12, 2017), http:\/\/twitter.com\/algiordano\/status\/940657230499733504 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/B427-KGXT].

Arguably, Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign operated similarly, redefining which states were swing states partly by changing the electorate. See William H.

See, e.g., Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1162\u201370, 1175\u201383 (providing charts of turnout in both primary and general elections and describ\u00ading strategies for making primary turnout more akin to turnout in the general election as a way to overcome the incentives created by party primaries in uncompetitive districts).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTurning now to the second concern: Wouldn\u2019t a peer-to-peer engage\u00adment strategy that depends on the party faithful inadvertently exacerbate legislative gridlock by increasing polarization? In this regard, it is important to state clearly the ways in which this project is driven by different concerns than party reforms primarily targeted at addressing polarization. This project is driven by the evidence that American democracy is suffering from a crisis of representation. If the broader citizenry is genuinely polarized\u2014a question that remains decidedly open\u2014legislative polarization would be representative democracy at work.[footnote]A continuing area of dispute is polarization\u2019s reach among the general electorate. Partisan polarization is certainly increasing and the parties appear to be increasingly draw\u00ading support from starkly different demographic groups. See generally Pew Research Ctr., The Parties on the Eve of the 2016 Election: Two Coalitions, Moving Further Apart 1 (2016), http:\/\/assets.pewresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2016\/09\/09-13-2016-Party-ID-release-final.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/2DTD-3NG8] (finding the two parties increas\u00adingly differ in terms of race, religion, ethnicity, and educational attainment); Pew Research Ctr., The Partisan Divide on Political Values Grows Even Wider (2017) [hereinafter Pew Research Ctr., The Partisan Divide], http:\/\/assets.pewresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\r\nsites\/5\/2017\/10\/05162647\/10-05-2017-Political-landscape-release.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\nEE6Q-BAQC] (summarizing survey results showing increased polariza\u00adtion of the electorate).

On this front, the trepidation appears to be driven by a fear that peer-to-peer strategies dependent on the party faithful (known to be more ideologically extreme) would polarize those with whom they come into contact.\r\n\r\nIn fact, however, there is reason to have confidence that an associational-party path would mitigate rather than exacerbate polariza\u00adtion. Much of the polarization research focuses on the political effects of partisan media and its dissemination online.[footnote]See Matthew S. Levendusky, Why Do Partisan Media Polarize Viewers?, 57 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 611, 612\u2013619 (2013) (finding, based on a review of the literature and a series of experiments, that partisan media does not polarize moderates and concluding they, instead, take \u201cpeople who are already somewhat extreme and makes them <em>even more extreme<\/em>\u201d).[\/footnote] But there is little reason to expect the dynamics of social media to permeate old-fashioned face-to-face retail politics. People act differently in person than online.[footnote]See generally Danielle Keats Citron, Hate Crimes in Cyberspace 57, 62 (2014) (touting the Internet\u2019s many civic virtues, including politically connecting individuals, while noting that \u201c[s]ome of the Internet\u2019s key features\u2014anonymity, mobilization of groups, and group polarization\u2014make it more likely that people will act destructively,\u201d including fueling, in certain contexts, \u201castronomical growth\u201d in extremist hate groups).[\/footnote] For a variety of psychological reasons (especially anonymity), it appears to be much easier to engage in asocial behaviors online than in person\u2014to be more confrontational, to express more extreme views, and to lie or misrepresent oneself.[footnote]See John Suler, The Online Disinhibition Effect, 7 CyberPsychol. &amp; Behav. 321, 322 (2004) (attributing this effect to, inter alia, anonymity and invisibility); see also Jacob Groshek &amp; Chelsea Cutino, Meaner on Mobile: Incivility and Impoliteness in Communicating Contentious Politics on Sociotechnical Networks, 2 Soc.

Brady et al., Prospecting for Participants, supra note 165, at 159\u201361 (confirm\u00ading the hypothesis that \u201crelationships [of various kinds] have the potential for giving a target added incentive to comply\u201d with requests to participate because \u201cwe ordinarily seek not to offend those to whom we are close\u201d); Broockman &amp; Kalla, supra note 209, at 223 (finding face-to-face conversations with individuals had persistent effects on attitudes toward transgender individuals, whereas surveys did not).[\/footnote] Certainly, the social-capital literature suggests that knitting together the polity and encouraging civic engagement is less likely to draw out the dark and dysfunctional elements of our politics.[footnote]The central claim of the social-capital literature is that face-to-face association in small and intimate groups\u2014neighborhood associations, bowling leagues, and clubs\u2014instills cooperative virtues, such as cooperation, reciprocity, and trust. See generally Nancy L. Rosenblum, Membership and Morals: The Personal Uses of Pluralism in America 29\u201341 (1998) (reviewing the social-capital literature in anticipation of criticizing it for failing to explain how the cultivation of social capital within face-to-face communities necessarily translates beyond that social context).[\/footnote] To the degree that an associational-party path envisions peer-to-peer mobilization online, it is primarily focused on situations where the con\u00adnection between those individuals also has a face-to-face manifestation\u2014such as the efforts of the Obama campaign. Particularly in that context, it seems just as plausible that the effect might run the other way: Contact with less ideologically extreme neighbors and associates might create a reality check for the most ideologically extreme because personal connection between peers might mitigate the inclination to simply reinforce one\u2019s beliefs.[footnote]Cf. Levendusky, supra note 262, at 617\u201319 (concluding, based on a series of experiments, that partisan media does not polarize moderates and finding it, instead, takes \u201cpeople who are already somewhat extreme and makes them <em>even more extreme<\/em>\u201d because of a natural tendency to wish to reinforce one\u2019s predispositions).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, this is an institutional-design project the primary goal of which is to ensure the openness of the channels of democratic politics, including parties, rather than a particular substantive outcome: If polarization is the outcome of broadening the electorate and enhancing its access to information, then so be it. The same is true if it turns out that the nation truly is racist, misogynist, prone to believe falsehoods, and enamored of hypercapitalism.[footnote]It is also, of course, possible that polarization is a phenomenon that cannot be contained and will keep increasing regardless of either campaign finance or mobilization efforts. See, e.g., Heather K. Gerken, Playing Cards in a Hurricane: Party Reform in an Age of Polarization, 54 Hous. L. Rev. 911, 914\u201317 (2017) (\u201c[T]he real question we should be asking is not <em>how<\/em> to reduce polarization but <em>whether<\/em> we can.\u201d). As to the spread of fake news, it is not at all clear how reforms in the vein of responsible party government would better address the fake-news phenomenon, nor is it at all clear that our Constitution per\u00admits efforts to regulate, even define, what is fake news.[\/footnote] At the moment, however, institutional features of contemporary democracy are driving those politi\u00adcal trends.[footnote]See Pildes, The Center Does Not Hold, supra note 1, at 329\u201333; see also Brady et al., Primary Elections, supra note 258, at 98\u201399 (finding that \u201ccandidates who do not appeal to an ideological base of organized voters are more likely to lose in the primaries\u201d and arguing that is an important explanation of party polarization in Congress).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that, notwithstanding the reasonableness of these various concerns, an associational-party approach is the only viable reform agenda. Responsible party government is not working.[footnote]See supra section I.B.[\/footnote] The political parties have not been sufficiently responsive to the electorate, and voters appear increasingly dissatisfied with the brands that are on offer.[footnote]See supra notes 80\u201384 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Nor is the most salient current party-reform agenda, which seeks to strengthen the power of party leaders by loosening or abolishing contribution limits to political parties\u2014either as a matter of statutory or (far worse) constitutional law\u2014significantly more promising.[footnote]See, e.g., La Raja &amp; Rauch, supra note 5, at 10\u201312; Issacharoff, Outsourcing Politics, supra note 4, at 865\u201370; La Raja, supra note 5, at 313\u201315.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nProponents of strengthening party leaders through deregulation argue that raising or removing contribution limits to the official political party will shore up party elites by leveling the playing field with so-called outside groups, such as Super PACs. This will, in turn, undercut the power of the more ideologically extreme elements of the partisan network, reduce polarization, and end legislative gridlock.[footnote]See, e.g., Pildes, Romanticizing Democracy, supra note 1, at 845.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUntamed deregulatory efforts, however, could push the formal politi\u00adcal parties further to the ideological extremes just as easily as they could bring forth moderate parties inclined to legislative compromise.[footnote]See Michael J. Malbin &amp; Charles R. Hunt, Campaign Fin. Inst., Party Contribution Limits and Polarization 7 (2017), http:\/\/www.cfinst.org\/pdf\/papers\/Party\r\nContributionLimits_Polarization.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/572N-55ED]; Gerken, supra note 268, at 915\u201319; Michael S.

Rev. 531, 601\u201303 (2016).[\/footnote] Why should we believe the newly empowered party elites will be the moderates of older days? Moderation depends on party competition. Conferring total control over the party brand to party leadership in the belief that electoral competition will force officials to tack back to the median voter\u2019s preferences certainly will not work absent electoral competition. But it may not work even where competition exists. Party competition, as noted previously, is a decidedly imperfect mechanism for producing policy responsiveness.[footnote]See supra notes 98\u201399 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEven putting to one side problems associated with party competition and its absence, it is not at all clear that leveling the playing field will redirect the flow back to the formal party and its leaders: Donors make campaign contributions to different entities depending on their inter\u00adests.[footnote]Samuel Issacharoff &amp; Jeremy Peterman, Special Interests After <em>Citizens United<\/em>: Access, Replacement, and Interest Group Response to Legal Change, 9 Ann. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Sci. 185, 187, 194\u201395 (2013).[\/footnote] Ideological donors may well continue to donate to ideological groups; moreover, even if they were to decide to fund the political parties, their demands for ideologically pure candidates are unlikely to disappear.[footnote]See Bauer, The Parties\u2019 Struggles, supra note 6, at 889; Gerken, supra note 268, at 917\u201319.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, unbridled deregulation of party funding is likely to strengthen the hands of wealthy donors.[footnote]Gerken, supra note 268, at 919.[\/footnote] In 2014, following <em>McCutcheon<\/em>, Congress substantially lifted contribution limits for three main areas of party expenditures: presidential nominating conventions, expenses associated with the construction and renovation of party headquarters, and litigation expenses associated with recounts and other election-related legal proceedings.[footnote]See 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030116(a)(9) (2012); see also Athena Jones, Lawmakers Chip Away at Campaign Finance Rules in Spending Bill, CNN Politics (Dec. 10, 2014), http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/12\/10\/politics\/spending-bill-campaign-donations\/index.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/9XZY-JLWN].[\/footnote] It is difficult to see how creating these kinds of party slush funds breeds accountability to the electorate.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7; see also Schmitt, supra note 4.[\/footnote] As Lee Drutman argues, deregulating to \u201callow[] party insiders to control larger pots of money\u201d may well improve party discipline, but it is not at all clear why it would make them more attentive to the interests of constituents rather than the (largely out-of-precinct) donors from whom the money arrives.[footnote]Drutman, supra note 7 (noting further that even when political party leaders have the funds, they do not spend them in primaries on moderate candidates).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the associational-party path is theoretically optimal as a guide to structuring First Amendment doctrine and as a measure for regulatory reforms\u2014even as it does not guarantee a cure to all our democratic ills. A party-reform agenda tailored to strengthening the associational life of political parties, including by redirecting the flow of money, is significantly less prone to these problems than one singularly focused on strengthening the political power of party leaders.\r\n\r\nThe central premise underlying an associational-party path is that curtailing the political influence of donors and other unrepresentative policy demanders requires creating a counterpoint to that influence by empowering and mobilizing millions of ordinary Americans through civic and political organizations.[footnote]Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1143\u201351 (argu\u00ading this approach is necessary because in a capitalist economy, in which wealth is not equally distributed, the wealthy benefit disproportionately from basic First Amendment guarantees, with respect to election-related spending, issue advocacy, lobbying, and fund\u00ading citizens\u2019 knowledge base); see also Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Key Findings: The Inevitable Limits of Campaign Finance Reform, Scholars Strategy Network (Sept. 2016), http:\/\/www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org\/brief\/inevitable-limits-campaign-finance-reform [http:\/\/perma.cc\/GE5X-YW4K] (providing a concise summary of the argument in <em>Beyond Campaign Finance Reform<\/em>).[\/footnote] Any deregulation of party financing must, therefore, be narrowly tailored to the goal of encouraging peer-to-peer party-building and voter-mobilization strategies that significantly rely on face-to-face interactions.\r\n\r\nFrom an associational perspective, in other words, the pertinent question for any deregulatory proposal ought to be where within the party the money is likely to flow. This is because responsive governance is most likely to arise out of a party capable of engaging a representative electorate in a peer-to-peer fashion through personal appeals by party activists and individuals in community-based civic associations. The impact of deregulation will be vastly different if it flows to political parties engaged in orchestrating volunteers and peer-to-peer mobilization rather than buying TV advertisements that seek to influence likely voters or paying for lavish party headquarters.[footnote]Similarly, from the perspective of an associational path to responsive party government, current efforts to increase small donors, such as matching programs, are too blunt. Efforts to enhance the amount of money small donors contribute online are useful to the degree that they free legislators\u2019 time to legislate and to spend more time with their constituents. But this solution is no magic bullet: Simply increasing the number of online contributions to campaigns from small donors through matching programs will not in and of itself empower those donors. To achieve that end, small-donor programs would also have to create incentives for legislators to give small donors opportunities for access simi\u00adlar to those big donors receive today. That is, they would need to be specifically structured to encourage elected officials and partisan elites to provide face-to-face access for small donors or to strengthen the power of existing membership-based political and civic organizations.[\/footnote] Even directing more money to state and local parties will not necessarily facilitate the development of \u201csocial capital by building connections, trust, and cooperation across diverse individuals and groups.\u201d[footnote]La Raja &amp; Rauch, supra note 5, at 5. None of the reforms that La Raja and Rauch propose explicitly address the sort of peer-to-peer strategies that are likely to increase social capital.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe associational-party path is preferable to other proposals for one final reason: Unlike responsible party government, it eschews the assumption that party reform alone can bear the entire weight of solving our democratic dysfunctions. Entrenched problems demand multifac\u00adeted interventions aimed at incremental change. Party reform can only ever be a partial solution. To the degree responsible party government suggested otherwise, it was obviously mistaken.\r\n\r\nReforms to address the associational qualities of the traditional party are most likely to succeed as part of a package of reforms aimed to empower ordinary Americans in politics by responding to broader transformations in civil society.[footnote]See Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1154\u201362, 1184\u201385 (documenting how \u201c[t]he chain of political accountability has\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. been weakened by the transformation of civic associations\u201d and arguing that campaign finance reformers need to turn their attention to legal strategies for empowering ordinary Americans in politics).[\/footnote] While the traditional party is arguably the least well situated to translate peer-to-peer strategies into a two-way street of communication given the cyclical nature of elections, the payoff of pursuing democratic accountability by promoting both electoral associations <em>and<\/em> civic associations derives from a central and recurring finding from the empirical research: Political experiences tend to produce additional and deeper civic and political engagement.[footnote]Abu El-Haj, Friends, Associates, and Associations, supra note 32, at 81\u201382 (noting \u201cempirical research indicates that civic participation breeds more participation\u201d and that \u201c[i]nitial forays into public life quickly turn into a habit, as individuals become part of social networks likely to encourage it\u201d).[\/footnote] Simply put, efforts to broaden electoral participation through peer-to-peer engagement, particularly when face-to-face, are likely to lead individuals into additional forms of political participation and organizational mem\u00adbership, thereby reinforcing efforts to stimulate a more representative and membership-based array of civic associations\u2014the kind most capable of breeding informed political participation.[footnote]Abu El-Haj, Beyond Campaign Finance Reform, supra note 2, at 1157\u201358 (noting \u201cthe critical feature missing in the vast majority of civic associations today is active mem\u00adbership and class-integrated, personal ties\u201d and concluding strong civic associations with active memberships have the unique \u201cability\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to generate political activity, including voting, and to effectively disseminate relevant political information to ordinary Americans\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPut differently, as the sociological definition of the party highlights, the formal party\u2014that is, the traditional focus of party reform\u2014is merely one type of node within the partisan network.[footnote]See supra notes 136\u2013144 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] In addition to candi\u00addates and formal party entities (governance and election-related entities), there are PACs of various sorts (primarily election-related entities) as well as\u2014and this is what the traditional account fails to notice\u2014certain civic associations (policy demanders that engage in electoral politics when it serves their interests). Efforts to increase responsive and accountable governance must seek improvements in all three arenas.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, given the failures of responsible party government, the associational-party path, on balance, offers the most viable route to inducing political parties and their elected officials to govern responsibly and responsively. Having outlined the assumptions and contours of an associational-party path, this Essay will next consider the implications for First Amendment doctrine.\r\n<h2>III. Reconceiving First Amendment Burdens<\/h2>\r\nWhile it is obviously possible to reshape the associational texture of partisan networks by shifting the regulatory framework to empower different legal entities within the partisan network, this Essay focuses on constitutional doctrine.[footnote]The author plans to consider the regulatory implications of an associational-party path in future work.[\/footnote] Many regulatory debates are best left to the democratic process, but the regulation of the democratic process is not one of them.[footnote]See Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Wholly Native to the First Amendment: The Positive Liberty of Self-Government, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. Online 241, 243\u201344 (2016), http:\/\/\r\nwww.pennlawreview.com\/online\/164-U-Pa-L-Rev-Online-241.pdf (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (\u201cA default rule of deference to legislatures with respect to the basic rules of democracy\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. requires a willful blindness to the realities of the rough and tumble of politics and the powerful incentives to entrenchment.\u201d).[\/footnote] The incentives of elected officials are too compromised to devise regulatory regimes that will induce political accountability.[footnote]See supra notes 48\u201354 and accompanying text (noting that a \u201ccentral preoccupa\u00adtion among scholars of American democracy\u201d is the fact that political parties are inevitably primarily interested in aggrandizing power); see also Tabatha Abu El-Haj, Changing the People: Legal Regulation and American Democracy, 86 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1, 6 (2011) (noting a central premise of the field of law of democracy is the recognition that \u201c[l]egislators\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. are problematic regulators when it comes to the rules governing elections because they are self-interested and are regularly tempted to use legal rules to entrench themselves\u201d).[\/footnote] It is, therefore, incumbent on First Amendment doctrine to allocate rights in ways that encourage democratic accountability and political responsiveness.\r\n\r\nToward this end, this Part identifies opportunities within existing First Amendment doctrine to strategically underwrite the strength of those segments of the partisan network that enhance opportunities for social contact between party elites and the broader electorate. The doctrinal proposal, set forth below, essentially entails two steps. The first would extend the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to all manner of political party regulations, including those that burden the First Amendment rights of the two major political parties. The second step would recalibrate the burdens analysis to focus on impediments to the party\u2019s ability to mobilize broad and representative political participation\u2014as opposed to those placed on access to the polls or the ballot, as in the typical case.\r\n<h3>A. Assessing Regulatory Burdens Within the Anderson\u2013Burdick Framework<\/h3>\r\nThere is no question that the First Amendment rights of formal political parties can shape the associational attributes of partisan networks. When a political party is forced to hold an open primary, for example, its partisan network is diversified. When it is prevented from holding open primaries, the power of party activists is heightened. An associational path to responsive party government suggests that First Amendment rights should be allocated in ways that prevent regulation from undermining either the socioeconomic and intergenerational breadth or the interpersonal depth of partisan networks.[footnote]For First Amendment purposes, the political party refers to the formal party; other nodes of the partisan network may have their own First Amendment rights.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe principal mistake of current doctrine is its preoccupation with protecting political parties, <em>as speakers<\/em>, from burdens placed on their brand.[footnote]See, e.g., McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 352 (2003) (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (explaining \u201cthe national political parties are exemplars of political speech,\u201d \u201cpromote coordinated political messages,\u201d and exist often \u201cprimarily for the purpose of expressing ideas and generating debate\u201d), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] Compounding this error is the fact that the members of the <em>Citizens United<\/em> majority appear to assume that any regulatory burden placed on a political party as a speaker demands strict scrutiny.[footnote]See Republican Party of La. v. FEC, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86, 94\u201395 (D.D.C. 2016) (recounting uncertainty with respect to the level of scrutiny in light of cases such as <em>McCutcheon v. FEC<\/em>), summarily aff\u2019d, 137 S. Ct. 2178 (2017).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFrom an associational-party perspective, not every restriction on a political party\u2019s freedom of speech and association \u201cis of constitutional dimension\u201d\u2014a point the Court has itself acknowledged at times.[footnote]<em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 99; see also FEC v. Colo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. (<em>Colorado Republican II<\/em>), 533 U.S. 431, 450 n.11 (2001) (making a similar argument when the party asserted only speech interests).[\/footnote] The primary concern is burdens placed on the party\u2019s ability to foster deep and wide social ties to a representative electorate. Burdens on the clarity of a party\u2019s message, by comparison, are much less important.\r\n\r\nExtending the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to the two major political parties would provide a relatively simple way to incorporate an associational-party perspective into existing First Amendment doctrine.[footnote]See generally Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433\u201343 (1992) (laying out the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework).[\/footnote] Developed in the context of restrictions on access to the ballot, the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework is particularly well suited to the task because it explicitly foregrounds analysis of the burdens, reserving strict scrutiny for cases in which the burdens are severe.[footnote]Id. at 433\u201343 (permitting some burdens to be placed on the right to vote in light of a recognition that elections must be regulated to ensure fairness and accuracy of the count).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAn associational-party perspective provides a new scale with which to weigh the burdens on a party\u2019s First Amendment rights in which the focus would turn to burdens placed on parties as associations and their capacity to foster deep and wide social ties to a representative electorate. A few lower courts have already taken this step, attending, in the context of challenges brought by minor parties, to the nature of the burdens placed on the party\u2019s ability to cultivate and maintain ties to the electorate.[footnote]See, e.g., Green Party of N.Y.

When First Amendment challenges have been brought by the leaders of a major political party, the tendency has been to simply apply strict scrutiny.[footnote]See Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 572, 582 (2000) (citing <em>Burdick v. Takushi<\/em> but failing to recite or explicitly apply its test before concluding strict scrutiny was warranted).[\/footnote] The only outlier was the recent case of <em>Washington State Grange v.

Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983))).[\/footnote] The <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework has never been mentioned in cases challenging restrictions on the financing of political parties, even by Justices reluctant to submit to <em>Buckley v.

It would also have the added benefit of affording political parties robust First Amendment protection without constitutionalizing an unbounded right to accept unlimited contributions.[footnote]As discussed above, the most aggressive version of the party-reform agenda, in the vein of responsible party government, seeks to achieve its end as a matter of constitutional dictate.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. Illustrating the New Approach in the Context of the Soft-Money Ban<\/h3>\r\nTo illustrate the implications of this doctrinal and analytic shift, con\u00adsider the controversy over the constitutionality of the 2002 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which closed the so-called soft-money loophole. In the 1990s, the national party committees regularly exploited the fact that federal law, at the time, exempted the financing of state and local elections as well as generic party-building activities from its regulatory purview.[footnote]See Shays v. FEC, 528 F.3d 914, 917\u201318 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (describing, concisely, the implications of the loophole).[\/footnote] Through this loophole, national party leaders solicited unlimited contributions (soft money), ostensibly earmarked for state or local elections, from big donors with promises of access to federal candidates and elected officials.[footnote]McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 122, 146\u201347 (2003) (defining soft money as money raised outside federal contribution limits by national party committees, often at the behest of candidates, ostensibly to cover expenses related to state and local elections, although intentionally spent in ways that benefited federal candidates), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] Those funds were then funneled to activities that, while formally related to state and local elections, directly benefited the federal candidates who appeared on the same ballot\u2014for example, sham issue advertisements (the bulk of the spending), voter-registration drives, and get-out-the-vote efforts.[footnote]<em>Shays<\/em>, 528 F.3d at 916 (\u201c\u2018[I]ssue ads\u2019 purportedly aimed at influencing people\u2019s policy views but actually [were] directed at swaying their views of [federal] candidates.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the use of the so-called soft-money loophole to circumvent FECA\u2019s contribution limits eventually raised concerns about the sort of solicitude donors were receiving from federal candidates and political parties. In response, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), which embraced a multipronged strategy for closing the soft-money loophole.[footnote]Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-155, 116 Stat. 81 (cod\u00adified as amended in scattered sections of 2 and 52 U.S.C.).[\/footnote] First, BCRA establishes caps on contributions from individuals to a federal political party committee.[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030116(a)(1)(B) (Supp. III 2016) (setting contribution limits to \u201cpolitical committees established and maintained by a national political party\u201d); see also id. \u00a7\u00a030118 (banning contributions to political parties and candidates from general funds of corporations and unions).[\/footnote] Second, it prohibits <em>both <\/em>federal political party committees from soliciting funds above their base contribution limits <em>and<\/em> state, district, or local parties from using funds solicited outside BCRA\u2019s new contribution limits for any \u201c<em>Federal election activity<\/em>.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a030125(a)\u2013(c) (emphasis added); see also 11 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a0300.32(a)(1)\u2013(3) (2018) (defining the hard-money requirement for state and local parties).[\/footnote] Finally, it adopts an extremely broad statutory definition of \u201cFederal election activities.\u201d[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030101(20).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhatever its merits as an effort to contain the influence of big donors, BCRA, unquestionably, has made it much more difficult for political parties to engage in joint party building and a variety of face-to-face mobilization efforts.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a030116(d) (raising the limits on coordinated expenditures between political parties and federal candidates above what would otherwise be applicable); see also <em>Colorado Republican II<\/em>, 533 U.S. 431, 445\u201364 (2001) (upholding the constitutionality of these limits on coordinated expenditures by parties with candidates out of concern that without such restrictions the source and amount contribution limits on candidates could easily be circumvented, enabling corruption).[\/footnote] Taken together, its provisions set up a regulatory regime in which <em>all<\/em> activities that fall within the statutory definition of \u201cFederal election activity\u201d must be funded with hard money (that is, those funds raised within federal base limits). After BCRA, not only issue ads (including sham ones)[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030101(20)(A)(iii) (defining \u201cFederal election activity\u201d as including \u201cpublic communication[s] that refer[] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\u201d and \u201cpromote[,]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. support[,]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. attack[,] or oppose[]\u201d her).[\/footnote] but also all voter identification, get-out-the-vote, and generic campaign activity conducted in connection with an election in which a candidate for federal office appears on the ballot, as well as voter-registration drives undertaken within 120 days of a federal election, must be paid for with hard money insofar as these practices constitute \u201cFederal election activity.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a030101(20)(A)(i)\u2013(ii); see also 11 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a0100.24 (defining \u201cFederal election activity\u201d as including get-out-the-vote and voter-identification activities).[\/footnote] Party officials who spend \u201cmore than 25 percent of [their] compensated time\u201d on \u201cactivities in connection with a Federal election,\u201d similarly, must be paid with hard money.[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030101(20)(A)(iv). Congress also explicitly excluded certain types of activities from the definition of \u201cFederal election activity.\u201d See id. \u00a7\u00a030101(20)(B).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCongress, to be fair, tried to offset these burdens by establishing a limited opportunity for intraparty coordination through Levin funds.[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030125(b)(2); see also 11 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a0300.32(a)(4), (b)\u2013(d) (delineating the conditions for the use of Levin funds).[\/footnote] Levin funds permit national party committees and state and local party committees to spend jointly on voter-registration activity, voter identifica\u00adtion, and get-out-the-vote drives, so long as, <em>inter alia<\/em>, no mention is made of a federal candidate.[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a030125(b)(2)(A)\u2013(B). Levin funds cannot be used to fund broadcast communications unless they refer \u201csolely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a030125(b)(2)(B)(ii).[\/footnote] Unfortunately, Levin funds are subject to complex and convoluted rules that make them virtually unusable.[footnote]See McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 163\u201364 (2003) (summarizing limits placed on the involvement of the national party in their solicitation, on how such funds can be raised, and on the sorts of transfers between party outposts that are permissible), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] As a consequence, they have not provided much relief.[footnote]See, e.g., Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment at 3, Republican Party of La. v. FEC, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86 (D.D.C. 2016) (No. 15-cv-01241), 2016 WL 1242607 (complain\u00ading that the Levin-fund exception is too convoluted to undertake); Letter from Neil Reiff, Counsel to Minn.

FEC<\/em>.[footnote]540 U.S. at 133\u201385 (rejecting a facial challenge to the constitutionality of these provisions); accord Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. FEC, 698 F.

Valeo<\/em>.[footnote]See <em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 134\u201338 &amp; n.40 (quoting FEC v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146, 162 (2003)); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25, 44\u201345 (1976).[\/footnote] The dissenters, however, were not persuaded.[footnote]See <em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 286\u201387, 308\u201314 (Kennedy, J., dissenting in part).[\/footnote] Justice Kennedy, in particular, advocated for the application of strict scrutiny on the grounds that the soft-money ban was neither a contribution nor an expenditure limit, but both at once and, as such, \u201cfundamentally alter[ed], and thereby burden[ed], protected speech and association throughout our society.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 314.[\/footnote] Given the absence of a compelling state interest, he maintained the provisions were unconstitutional.[footnote]See id. Justice Kennedy further argued that soft-money expenditures undertaken independently of candidates, by definition, \u201clack[] a possibility for <em>quid pro quo<\/em> corruption of federal officeholders.\u201d Id. at 301.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile the contribution\u2013expenditure distinction is a conceptual quagmire, Justice Kennedy\u2019s alternative\u2014strict scrutiny for any party regulation arguably involving speech\u2014is no better. The former framework assumes that contribution limits are virtually never constitutionally problematic in the name of a pragmatic compromise. The latter amounts to the rote application of strict scrutiny, thereby granting political parties an effectively unlimited First Amendment right to accept campaign contributions.[footnote]Presumably, the theory is as follows: Since money is speech and a political party is a speaker, any restriction on the money that a political party has at its disposal during an electoral campaign amounts to an unconstitutional burden on its freedom of speech in the absence of a compelling state interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. See, e.g., id. at 319, 321.[\/footnote] Neither approach attempts to consider the underlying First Amendment interests before assessing whether the campaign finance burden is of constitutional dimension.[footnote]Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433\u201334 (1992) (describing the differing stan\u00addards the Court applies to \u201csevere\u201d versus \u201creasonable\u201d restrictions on First and Fourteenth Amendment voting rights).[\/footnote] Both completely neglect the ends to which First Amendment rights ought to be granted.\r\n\r\nThe <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework, by contrast, is already sensitive to determining which burdens placed on political parties are of constitutional dimension.[footnote]See id.[\/footnote] The test explicitly foregrounds analysis of these burdens, reserving strict scrutiny for cases in which they are severe, in recognition of the fact that the legitimacy of elections frequently depends on their regulation. Extending the framework\u2014from the current doctrine, in which it applies to cases involving burdens on the right to participate and those involving minor parties, to cases involving the two major political parties\u2014provides a unique opportunity to develop a theoretically sound doctrine capable of allocating First Amendment rights to political parties in ways that facilitate the goals of democratic accountability and responsiveness.\r\n\r\nTo further the associational path to party responsiveness, however, it is necessary to establish a new measure for how to weigh those burdens.[footnote]One could, of course, extend the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to cases involving the major political parties but remain faithful to responsible party government by focusing on burdens placed on the party leaders\u2019 ability to speak clearly. While this would be better than rote application of strict scrutiny to any regulation placed on the major political par\u00adties, the associational-party path rejects this approach insofar as it would not strengthen the associational life of political parties.[\/footnote] The critical questions would become: first, whether the regulation decreases a party\u2019s ability to mobilize political participation and facilitate information transmission through peer-to-peer appeals by party activists; and second, whether it otherwise undermines the party\u2019s organizational stability and coalition-building capacity. The former burdens are worrisome not only because personalized solicitations are particularly effective means for facilitating electoral participation but also because genuine points of contact with the electorate are more likely to ground elected officials in the experiences of their constituents.[footnote]See supra sections II.B\u2013.C.[\/footnote] The latter burdens are worrisome to the degree that the need to rebuild organizational capacity each cycle detracts from the ability to sustain political engagement over the long term. The extension would have the added payoff of bringing coherence to the doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn the context of BCRA\u2019s soft-money ban, shifting to the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> test demands a separate analysis for each of the three types of party expenditures implicated: (1) voter-identification, -registration, and get-out-the-vote initiatives; (2) state and local party staff; and (3) issue advocacy. Ultimately, the recalibrated <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>test points to a middle-ground position, in which some, but not all, aspects of the soft-money ban would be held unconstitutional. When the question of whether a burden should be deemed severe turns on how it impacts the party\u2019s ability to foster broad social networks with interpersonal depth, it is the first two limitations on expenditures that pose the most severe burdens. This section addresses each provision in turn.\r\n\r\nThe congressional choice to define \u201cFederal election activity\u201d to include voter-registration, -identification, and -mobilization drives under\u00adtaken within 120 days of a federal election, thereby requiring that such activities be undertaken with hard money, burdens core First Amendment interests. Face-to-face appeals are incredibly effective for fostering short- and long-term political participation, as we have seen, but are also extremely costly.[footnote]Donald P. Green &amp; Alan S. Gerber, Get Out the Vote: How to Increase Voter Turnout 10, 13, 34\u201340, 77\u201379, 94\u201395 (2004) (comparing the effectiveness and cost of different get-out-the-vote strategies and arguing that door-to-door, in-person canvassing, even by paid workers, is the \u201cgold-standard mobilization tactic\u201d); Bauer, The Right to \u201cDo Politics,\u201d supra note 30, at 77\u201378 (discussing the costs of association building).[\/footnote] When party resources are limited, it is reasonable to expect parties to choose cheaper forms of mobilization, such as impersonal mass communication. In fact, campaigns frequently devote far fewer resources to such efforts, despite their broader demo\u00adcratic returns.[footnote]See, e.g., Steve Phillips, Opinion, How Democrats Should Spend Their Millions, N.Y. Times (Apr. 17, 2017), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/04\/17\/opinion\/how-democrats-should-spend-their-millions.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (criticizing Jon Ossoff\u2019s campaign for spending around 80% of its $6 million on advertis\u00ading rather than a face-to-face turnout operation); Steve Phillips, Opinion, How to Build a Democratic Majority that Lasts, N.Y.

The central problem is that this aspect of BCRA limits the money available for the most promising path to deepening and broadening political participation and responsive party government. The very requirement that such activities may only be undertaken with hard money and Levin funds, where applicable, in the ordinary case will limit the amount of mobilization undertaken.\r\n\r\nCertainly, campaigns that have specific strategic reasons to devote resources to their ground game will find ways to fund it using a combination of hard and soft money. The Obama campaigns, for instance, orchestrated a significant ground game in both 2008 and 2012 while operating under BCRA.[footnote]That said, BCRA may still have impacted Obama\u2019s strategy (at least in 2012 when he was no longer an outsider) to the degree the campaign often sidestepped state and local parties. Professor Issacharoff has recounted the following regarding his experience as a senior legal advisor to Obama for America in 2012:\r\n\r\nWith the benefits of Obama\u2019s incumbency\u00a0. . . I had expected that the 2012 campaign would be largely organized around the state political par\u00adties in conjunction with state and local election efforts. Notably, and with few exceptions, that was not the case. There were certainly more points of contact with state officials that helped smooth the voting process on Election Day and more time to litigate contested issues before Election Day. But in terms of organizational structure, the campaign was run through the presidential effort and not through the state parties.\r\n\r\nIssacharoff, Outsourcing Politics, supra note 4, at 847\u201348. Contribution caps to parties also limit the ability of political parties to coordinate with civic organizations in the party net\u00adwork in such endeavors without running afoul of contribution limits. See Bauer, The Right to \u201cDo Politics,\u201d supra note 30, at 77\u201379.[\/footnote] The effects of BCRA\u2019s constraints on the choices in the average campaign, in which resources are more limited and the payoff of a ground game less clear, however, are likely to be significant.\r\n\r\nThe <em>McConnell <\/em>Court, it is true, flatly rejected the suggestion that contribution caps limited the resources available to parties, pointing out the ways in which they merely incentivize parties to reach out to more individuals to achieve their fundraising goals. As the Court put it, \u201c[t]he \u2018overall effect\u2019 of dollar limits on contributions is \u2018merely to require candidates and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons.\u2019\u201d[footnote]McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 136 (2003) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 21\u201322 (1976)), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] On this view, contribution limits are not a burden on the associational life of parties; instead, they promote it by incentivizing parties to expand their donor base.\r\n\r\nThere are several problems with the <em>McConnell <\/em>Court\u2019s analysis. First, contribution limits may incentivize reaching out to more donors, but they do not incentivize spending on face-to-face mobilization efforts, as opposed to impersonal, media advertising, for example. Second, monetary contributions are a very thin sort of association. This is especially true of donations generated online or through mass mailings insofar as they provide no opportunity to facilitate a two-way street of communication.\r\n\r\nThird, and most damningly, it is unquestionably the case that Congress could have adopted far less restrictive alternatives that would have both contained the soft-money problem and maintained, perhaps even incentivized, the growth of the party faithful and richer forms of association. For one, BCRA could have exempted money raised to fund <em>individualized<\/em>, <em>face-to-face<\/em> forms of campaigning from its definition of federal election activity. Ironically, an early FEC rule turned on this distinction. Unfortunately, rather than exempting personalized voter-registration and get-out-the-vote activities from hard-money limits, the FEC excluded generic letters and prerecorded telephone calls from the statutory definition and thus the hard money restrictions.[footnote]Cf. Shays v. FEC, 528 F.3d 914, 931\u201332 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (striking down the FEC rule on grounds that, in the absence of a persuasive justification, the FEC\u2019s narrow defini\u00adtion \u201c[ran] directly counter to BCRA\u2019s purpose\u201d).[\/footnote] In other words, it redirected the flow of soft money to impersonal forms of voter engagement utterly incapable of facilitating a two-way street of communication.\r\n\r\nAnother less burdensome approach would have replaced the cumbersome Levin-fund amendment with an exemption allowing state and local political parties to freely coordinate with existing civic associations, including churches and unions, <em>in any face-to-face recruitment efforts<\/em>.[footnote]See Bauer, The Right to \u201cDo Politics,\u201d supra note 30, at 73 (expressing concern that current rules inhibit coalition building, rather than democratic participation per se); cf. Bob Bauer, Super PACs and Concerns About Political Equality, More Soft Money Hard Law (Feb. 12, 2016), http:\/\/www.moresoftmoneyhardlaw.com\/2016\/02\/super-pacs-concerns-political-equality\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/Y89V-BCAS] (\u201cTargeted regulatory relief should be available for other membership-based organizations, and even to candidates when conducting particular voter mobilization activities.\u201d).[\/footnote] It is well known that local parties with ties to labor unions or community-based associations tend to have substantial points of intersection with the electorate\u2014knocking on doors, hosting events with elected officials, and boosting turnout.[footnote]See Masket, supra note 38, at 184; cf. id. at 119\u201320, 180\u201382 (discussing Congresswoman Maxine Waters\u2019 ties with the New Frontier Democratic Club, \u201clocal activists,\u201d and \u201cmany church and civic leaders\u201d in South Los Angeles, and her influence over other elections in her district).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEither option would have been not only less burdensome but also more promising from an associational-party perspective. Both would have nudged the political parties to spend in ways more likely to mobilize a broader electorate (possibly even a more representative one) through the party faithful (including volunteers and state and local parties), thereby creating a variety of opportunities for opening up the two-way street of communication discussed above. Such targeted deregulation is far more promising than approaches that result in unbridled, unlimited contributions\u2014or that raise contribution limits for funding party conventions, headquarters, and litigation. To the degree that any monetary contribution raises some risk of corruption or its appearance (and, greater still, a risk of preferential treatment), surely it would be better to have the contributed money go toward activities that are most likely to produce a counterweight to those interests, such as an engaged electorate?[footnote]Cf. <em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 168 (raising the concern that \u201c[b]ecause voter registra\u00adtion, voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activity all confer substantial bene\u00adfits on federal candidates, the funding of such activities creates a significant risk of actual and apparent corruption\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo be sure, those who have challenged the constitutionality of the soft-money ban have not focused on these associational burdens. In the most recent challenge, brought by the Republican Party of Louisiana, there was no mention of a desire for expanded funds with which to engage in peer-to-peer mobilization efforts in order to expand its electoral base.[footnote]See Republican Party of La. v. FEC, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86 (D.D.C. 2016) (containing no mention of funds for peer-to-peer mobilization efforts), summarily aff\u2019d, 137 S. Ct. 2178 (2017).[\/footnote] Instead, the demand for unregulated contributions, it argued, would cover costs associated with its website, emails, and mass mailings.[footnote]Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment at 9\u201328, <em>Republican Party of La.<\/em>, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86 (No. 15-cv-01241), 2016 WL 1242607; see also Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief at 29\u201333, <em>Republican Party of La.<\/em>, 219 F. Supp. 3d 86 (No. 15-cv-01241) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). In only one paragraph does the party allege a desire to engage in voter-identification activity, again by mail. Id. at 33.[\/footnote] In this regard, its complaint is consistent with the views of state party officials surveyed on the effects of federal campaign finance law, which made little mention of burdens on the sorts of peer-to-peer strategies that increase social capital.[footnote]Professor Raymond La Raja and Jonathan Rauch, similarly, focus on the compara\u00adtive advantage of state and local parties with respect to mass mailers. La Raja &amp; Rauch, supra note 5, at 5, 15\u201318 (emphasizing that state parties qualify for the nonprofit rate at the U.S. Postal Service, unlike Super PACs). Their survey did not specifically ask how often state parties engaged in peer-to-peer strategies for mobilization, in person or by email. This would appear to be a glaring oversight given that they argue that \u201cstate parties are\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the tissue of civic and cultural organizations that creates social capital by building connec\u00adtions, trust, and cooperation across diverse individuals and groups.\u201d Id. at 5; see also id. at 7, 20\u201321 (presenting survey data). It is difficult to see how mass mailers produce social capital.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAn associational-party perspective similarly offers a new measure for assessing the First Amendment burdens placed on political parties by BCRA\u2019s requirement that the \u201cservices provided during any month by an employee of a State, district, or local committee of a political party who spends more than 25 percent of that individual\u2019s compensated time during that month on activities in connection with a Federal election\u201d be undertaken with hard money.[footnote]52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a030101(20)(A)(iv), 30125(b) (2012).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo the degree this requirement undermines the organizational capacity to build a partisan network with sustained ties to the electorate, it poses a severe constitutional burden. It is well established that a significant weakness of the contemporary American party system is the seasonal quality of local and state party associations\u2014measured in terms of, inter alia, the number of full-time party staff between election seasons.[footnote]Douglas D. Roscoe &amp; Shannon Jenkins, Changes in Local Party Structure and Activity, 1980\u20132008, <em>in<\/em> The State of the Parties: The Changing Role of Contemporary American Parties 228, 237 (John C. Green et al. eds., 2014) (arguing the intermittent character of local party organizations results from the fact that they \u201cmainly are useful [to candidates] in the period immediately preceding elections and are less critical to candidates\u2014or anyone else\u2014during the interim intervals\u201d).[\/footnote] The infirmity of state and local parties is critical because they serve as the national parties\u2019 primary link to the electorate. As Justice Scalia astutely noted in his dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to strike down party patronage, a traditional instrument of party building and discipline, the need for low-level party workers is not \u201cobsolete\u201d:\r\n<blockquote>[Mass media has] supplemented but not supplanted personal contacts. Certainly they have not made personal contacts unnecessary in campaigns for the lower level offices that are the foundations of party strength, nor have they replaced the myriad of functions performed by party regulars not directly related to campaigning.[footnote]Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 105 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nOnce again, some might object that the requirement that state and local party workers who spend more than 25% of their time campaigning for federal elections be paid out of hard money has positive associational effects by creating an incentive to recruit volunteers. Surely, a volunteer-based political party is likely to have broader connections to the electorate than a professional party. Moreover, a volunteer-based party will have broader democratic repercussions insofar as initial forays into politics, such as volunteering to canvass a neighborhood for a campaign, are known to lead to even more substantial political activity.\r\n\r\nRegulations that incentivize the use of volunteers unquestionably have distinct associational benefits for all the previously stated reasons. Encouraging volunteerism is critical: Initial forays into electioneering are likely to breed or sustain activism beyond individual campaigns and thus feed the desired two-way street of communication, which depends on active and sustained membership within the party network.\r\n\r\nThat said, regulations that incentivize recruiting volunteers while undercutting the nodes within the formal party that are most capable of orchestrating that volunteerism impose significant First Amendment burdens. It is unquestionably difficult to organize volunteers without paid staff; moreover, it does not serve any larger democratic goal to insist that candidates reinvent a participatory network each cycle.\r\n\r\nFinally, from an associational-party perspective, BCRA\u2019s requirement that issue ads be undertaken with hard money no longer seems constitutionally suspect. When the path to responsible governance does not lie in the clarity of the message but in the breadth and depth of the network, the inclusion of issue ads within BRCA\u2019s regulatory purview is a much less significant First Amendment burden. The party\u2019s freedom of speech is adequately preserved by its ability to use hard money to speak <em>independently<\/em>.[footnote]Colo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604, 615\u201318 (1996); accord McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 171 (2003) (suggesting that when a political party has an alternative avenue of expression available to it, the burdens are less severe), overruled in part by Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[\/footnote] By contrast, when the route to good governance is understood to run through the party brand, it is the burdens on the party\u2019s ability to speak that are most troubling. It is BCRA\u2019s provision that issue ads must be purchased with hard money that raises the most alarm insofar as it undermines the party\u2019s capacity to disseminate its brand.[footnote]<em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 352 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt should now be clear how the doctrinal proposal being offered in this Essay is significantly different from the current state of the party jurisprudence. Simply put, the proposal being made is that the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick <\/em>framework be extended to all cases involving challenges to regulatory burdens placed on the major political parties, and that courts should allocate First Amendment rights in ways that prevent regulation from undermining the socioeconomic and intergenerational breadth or the interpersonal depth of all partisan networks<em>.<\/em> The current doctrinal preoccupation with shoring up party elites and their ability to define and control their distinct political brand, in other words, would be replaced by a focus on how challenged regulations might impact a party\u2019s capacity to mobilize broad and representative political participation or to facilitate a two-way street of information transmission through party activists.\r\n<h3>C. From Here to There: Assessing Probabilities of Doctrinal Change<\/h3>\r\nOne remaining question is whether any of this is possible. Convincing the Court to bring consistency to its doctrine is an easy sell; persuading it to abandon the theoretical underpinnings of its doctrine, less so. Still, there may be more opportunity than usual to do so. The associational-party path to responsive governance fits more comfortably within the First Amendment tradition than the theoretical alternatives the Supreme Court has rejected in the past.[footnote]See Stephanopoulos, supra note 100, at 288, 291\u201398 (noting the Supreme Court\u2019s commitment to an individual-rights-based approach and its unwillingness to reorganize doctrine around competitiveness).[\/footnote] For one, it speaks in the traditional register of rights. For another, it is premised on a commit\u00adment shared by both wings of the current Supreme Court that citizen participation breeds democratic responsiveness and accountability.\r\n\r\nThe centrality of political participation to our republican form of government is a leitmotif in the Court\u2019s decisions relating to parties and elections. In <em>California Democratic Party v. Jones<\/em>, Justice Kennedy asserted that \u201c[e]ncouraging citizens to vote is a legitimate, indeed essential, state objective; for the constitutional order must be preserved by a strong, participatory democratic process.\u201d[footnote]540 U.S. 567, 587 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (striking down the state\u2019s blanket primary as a threat to the party leadership\u2019s control of its message).[\/footnote] More recently, Chief Justice Roberts explained:\r\n<blockquote>There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders. Citizens can exercise that right in a variety of ways: They can run for office themselves, vote, urge others to vote for a particular candidate, volunteer to work on a campaign, and contribute to a candi\u00addate\u2019s campaign.[footnote]McCutcheon v. FEC, 134 S. Ct. 1434, 1440\u201341 (2014) (arguing \u201ca central feature of democracy\u201d is the notion that \u201ccandidates who are elected can be expected to be responsive to [the] concerns\u201d of those who contributed to their campaigns) (citing Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 360 (2010)). Professors Fishkin and Gerken make a fair point that <em>McCutcheon<\/em> offers an odd and elitist version of democratic participation and influence insofar as it frames donors as constituents to which responsiveness is in order, despite the fact that those donors typically live outside the district. Fishkin &amp; Gerken, supra note 30, at 203.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nNor is the motif a new one. In <em>FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc<\/em>., a case involving a challenge to rules related to corporate election spend\u00ading, the Court\u2019s decision to strike down certain federal restrictions on corporate political spending was driven, in part, by a concern that complying with the challenged regulations might lead some civic groups to \u201cdecide[] that the contemplated political activity was simply not worth it.\u201d[footnote]479 U.S. 238, 255, 263 (1986) (Brennan, J.) (holding unconstitutional a federal law that prohibited a voluntary political association from using its treasury funds to finance a pro-life voter guide simply because of the organization\u2019s corporate form and noting \u201c[v]oluntary political associations do not suddenly present the specter of corruption merely by assuming the corporate form\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEqually relevant, the Court routinely assumes\u2014perhaps a little too naively\u2014that democratic participation leads to political responsiveness. Justice Kennedy, in particular, is prone to emphasize the need for First Amendment protections at the nexus between political participation and legislative responsiveness.[footnote]See, e.g., <em>McConnell<\/em>, 540 U.S. at 297 (Kennedy, J., dissenting in part) (\u201cIt is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is prem\u00adised on responsiveness.\u201d).[\/footnote] In fact, this nexus appears to have motivated his decision to write separately in <em>Nevada Commission for Ethics v. Carrigan<\/em>, a case involving a challenge to a statute that mandated legislative recusals on matters in which a reasonable person would think the legislator had a material interest through a personal connection.[footnote]564 U.S. 117, 129 (2011) (Kennedy, J., concurring).[\/footnote] Justice Kennedy\u2019s reservations about the premise underlying Nevada\u2019s statute are revealing:\r\n<blockquote>As a general matter, citizens voice their support and lend their aid because they wish to confer the powers of public office on those whose positions correspond with their own. That dynamic, moreover, links the principles of participation and representation at the heart of our democratic government. Just as candidates announce positions in exchange for citizens\u2019 votes, so too citizens offer endorsements, advertise their views, and assist political campaigns based upon bonds of common purpose. These are the mechanisms that sustain representative democracy.[footnote]Id. at 131\u201332.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nFor all these reasons, the associational-party path to responsive governance fits comfortably within the First Amendment tradition. The value of common ground should not be underestimated when it comes to proposals for doctrinal change, especially when some members of the Court may already be wary of the path it has forged.[footnote]See supra notes 102\u2013113 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the proposed extension of the <em>Anderson\u2013Burdick<\/em> framework to cases involving the First Amendment rights of the major political parties has several virtues. First, it provides an eminently plausi\u00adble way of working within the contours of existing First Amendment doctrine to underwrite those segments of the partisan network that already enhance opportunities for social contact between party elites and the broader electorate and their associated virtues. Second, it offers to bring coherence to the doctrine, and it resonates with existing commit\u00adments of a doctrine that the Court itself has devised to serve broader democratic goals of responsiveness and accountability. In that regard, it provides a relatively easy point of entry for doctrinal reform. Finally, the extension demonstrates what a commitment to incremental change looks like as well as how the theory could inform campaign finance reform should that topic return to the political agenda.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nThe Supreme Court has long granted political parties constitutional protection from government intrusion in recognition of their central role in promoting democratic accountability. Unfortunately, it has done so on the basis of a set of theoretical assumptions about how to induce responsive and responsible governance that do not hold true in contemp\u00adorary American politics. Worse still, this attachment to responsible party government has crowded out other plausible paths to self-governance.\r\n\r\nThis Essay has argued that the Court\u2019s recent denials of certiorari in important party cases have granted a much-needed reprieve\u2014an opportunity to pause to consider an alternative path to responsive and responsible governance. In doing so, it has explained the basis for believing that an alternative path exists once we focus on political parties as civic associations rather than speakers. More specifically, it has argued that reinforcing the chains of democratic accountability lies in the promotion of integrated, cross-class partisan networks.\r\n\r\nAchieving responsive and accountable governance by strengthening the breadth and depth of partisan networks will be difficult. The changes in the structure of American society since the 1950s are here to stay. The route to political power no longer runs through veterans\u2019 groups, the Masonic Lodges, or the Klan, and few want the key to political power to return to sex-segregated and racially exclusionary men\u2019s clubs. Socioeconomic segregation in American life is also fairly entrenched.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, given the known failures of responsible party govern\u00adment, an associational approach presents the only viable way to induce responsive and accountable governance today. It is theoretically optimal, both as a guide to structuring First Amendment doctrine and as a measure for future regulatory reforms\u2014even as it does not guarantee a cure to all our democratic ills. And it is, therefore, essential to begin to identify those opportunities to reshape existing partisan networks given the world in which we live.\r\n\r\nEmbracing the associational-party framework is a necessary compo\u00adnent of any multidimensional approach to addressing the democratic dysfunctions that pervade U.S. politics. Democracy is an aspiration that requires ongoing work. The goal at any given moment is to attain more, rather than fewer, of these democratic goods. Party reform will inevitably be only a partial solution. The parties\u2019 incentives to accurately inform ordinary citizens are limited, and their interests in being held accountable are even weaker. If political parties were the only piece in the self-governance puzzle, the project would likely be doomed to fail. Thankfully, there are other institutions\u2014most importantly, civic associations and the press. Each has mixed incentives, but each can also compensate for the limits of the others, and therein lies a basis for hope. To the degree the sorts of party reforms advocated for here are married to efforts to revitalize civic associations for ordinary Americans, there is significant room for optimism.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

           The rise of arbitration has been one of the most significant develop­ments in civil justice. Many scholars have criticized arbitration for, among other things, “privatizing” or “delegating” the state’s dispute-resolution powers and allowing private parties to abuse those powers with virtual impunity. An implicit assumption underlying this critique is that civil procedure, in contrast to arbitration, does not delegate sig­nificant state[...]

 							"articleBody": "<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\r\nPrivate parties are performing an increasing number of functions that were once discharged by the government. Indeed, privatization has become so pervasive that some public law scholars have dubbed it the \u201cnew religion.\u201d[footnote]E.g., Martha Minow, Public and Private Partnerships: Accounting for the New Religion, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1229, 1229 (2003) [hereinafter Minow, Public and Private Partnerships].[\/footnote] While scholars have criticized this development on many differ\u00adent grounds,[footnote]For a recent example, see generally Jon D. Michaels, Constitutional Coup: Privatization\u2019s Threat to the American Republic (2017) (criticizing privatization for under\u00admining separation-of-powers principles).[\/footnote] one particularly prominent criticism is that privati\u00adzation involves a problematic \u201cdelegation\u201d of state[footnote]For clarity, this Article uses \u201cstate\u201d when referring to \u201cthe state\u201d and \u201cState\u201d when referring to one of the fifty United States.[\/footnote] power to private parties.[footnote]See generally Gillian E. Metzger, Privatization as Delegation, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1367 (2003) (analyzing the constitutional problems posed by the privatization of govern\u00admental functions).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDispute resolution has hardly been immune from the privatization trend. One of the most significant developments in civil justice during the last few decades has been the mass exodus of private disputes from public courts to private forms of dispute resolution, particularly arbitra\u00adtion.[footnote]For an overview of the controversy surrounding consumer arbitration, as well as empirical findings confirming its significance, see generally David Horton &amp; Andrea Cann Chandrasekher, After the Revolution: An Empirical Study of Consumer Arbitration, 104 Geo. L.J. 57 (2015).[\/footnote] Many scholars have criticized arbitration in terms that echo some of the criticisms of privatization more generally. In particular, some have espoused various versions of what this Article calls the \u201cdelegation cri\u00adtique.\u201d The gravamen of the critique is that the current arbitration regime delegates state power to private parties and allows them to abuse that power with virtual impunity. Judith Resnik has thus criticized arbitra\u00adtion for \u201cdelegating,\u201d \u201coutsourcing,\u201d or \u201cprivatizing\u201d the judicial func\u00adtion.[footnote]See Judith Resnik, A2J\/A2K: Access to Justice, Access to Knowledge, and Economic Inequalities in Open Courts and Arbitrations, 96 N.C.

Scholars have leveled similar criticisms against other forms of \u201cprocedural private ordering,\u201d see Jaime Dodge, The Limits of Procedural Private Ordering, 97 Va. L. Rev. 723, 728 (2011), particularly \u201ccontract procedure\u201d\u2014contractual provisions that purport to alter the procedural rules that generally govern the resolution of private disputes in public courts. The most prominent example is Kevin E. Davis and Helen Hershkoff\u2019s article, which criticizes contract procedure as a form of (interchangeably) \u201cprivatization,\u201d \u201coutsourcing,\u201d and \u201cdelegation,\u201d and connects that concern to the worry that contract procedure forgoes various \u201cpublic goods\u201d associated with adjudication. Kevin E. Davis &amp; Helen Hershkoff, Contracting for Procedure, 53 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 507, 512\u201313 (2011). For another example, see David H. Taylor &amp; Sara M. Cliffe, Civil Procedure by Contract: A Convoluted Confluence of Private Contract and Public Procedure in Need of Congressional Control, 35 U. Rich. L. Rev. 1085, 1087 (2002) (discussing predispute procedural agreements and courts\u2019 role in enforcing them). These criticisms apply to arbitration a fortiori.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile largely accepting the main thrust of the delegation critique, this Article challenges one of its key assumptions, with implications both for our understanding of civil procedure and for our policies toward arbi\u00adtration. Scholars have rightly worried that the current arbitration regime delegates significant coercive power to private parties and that the Supreme Court has construed the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) so as to deny courts adequate authority to review arbitral proceedings and awards.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.1. For one example, see Hall St. Assocs. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586\u201388 (2008) (holding that courts may not expand the grounds for modifying or vacating an arbitral award beyond those provided in the FAA, even with the agreement of the parties).[\/footnote] The result is a system in which private parties and their chosen arbitrators enjoy wide latitude to abuse delegated state power, violating important public values in the process. Yet proponents of the delegation critique tend to assume that civil procedure, in contrast to arbitration, vests state power largely with state officials and institutions.[footnote]See infra notes 31\u201333 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] In fact, this Article shows, civil procedure has already worked through its own delega\u00adtion problem. Drawing on liberal political theory, this Article contends that broad delegations of state power are ubiquitous in ordinary civil lit\u00adigation too. With these delegations comes the potential for abuse. Rather than limit private parties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to its delegations before any abuse has occurred, civil procedure primarily relies on a wide array of doctrines to <em>police<\/em> the delegations for abuse after the fact.[footnote]Much obviously turns on the meaning of the terms \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201cabuse.\u201d This Article elaborates on both at infra Part II.[\/footnote] These delegation-policing doctrines enable the state to withhold or withdraw its support from exer\u00adcises of delegated power that offend especially important pub\u00adlic values. In revealing the extent of the delegations in ordinary civil liti\u00adgation and examining civil procedure\u2019s strategies for policing them, this Article develops a novel theoretical account of civil procedure. It then uses that account to show how we might adapt civil procedure\u2019s delegation-polic\u00ading doctrines for arbitration. Civil procedure, this Article suggests, already contains the necessary conceptual and normative resources to address many of the problems with the current arbitration regime.\r\n\r\nThe claim that ordinary civil litigation pervasively delegates state power conflicts with commonly held impressions of our civil justice sys\u00adtem.[footnote]See, e.g., Zachary D. Clopton, Redundant Public-Private Enforcement, 69 Vand. L. Rev. 285, 323 (2016) [hereinafter Clopton, Redundant] (\u201cCourts actively supervise litigants and attorneys\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Scott Dodson, Party Subordinance in Federal Litigation, 83 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1, 20 (2014) (asserting that the circumstances in which litigants can act free from judicial oversight are \u201crelatively rare and quite narrow\u201d).[\/footnote] In fact, civil litigation is a public institution administered largely by private parties. It is public, of course, in that it proceeds under the auspices of state bodies (that is, courts), subject to the ultimate decision\u00admaking authority of state officials (that is, judges). At the same time, however, our civil justice system delegates significant coercive power to private par\u00adties. Private parties decide whether to hale others into court; they deter\u00admine which documents to demand and whom to depose during dis\u00adcovery; and they often end up rendering binding dispositions of ongoing lawsuits by deciding whether to settle a case and on what terms.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] Many times judges lack formal authority to preempt parties\u2019 decisions on these matters. Even when judges do have such authority, their hands often remain tied, at least initially, as a practical matter.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] In many other legal systems, state officials closely control the investigation and prosecution of civil cases.[footnote]On the greater involvement of state officials at all stages of civil litigation in civil law systems, see generally Mirjan R. Dama\u0161ka, The Faces of Justice and State Authority: A Comparative Approach to the Legal Process (1986); Kuo-Chang Huang, Introducing Discovery into Civil Law 37\u2013103 (2003).[\/footnote] So too in our own criminal justice system, the investigatory and prosecutorial functions are largely the province of state police offi\u00adcers and prosecutors. One of the hallmarks of our civil justice system, by contrast, is that it assigns these and other powers to private parties rather than state officials.[footnote]While other scholars have not completely ignored civil procedure\u2019s various dele\u00adgations, they have tended to view the delegations in isolation from one another rather than as manifestations of a single phenomenon. For example, Richard Nagareda depicted the power of class counsel to negotiate class action settlements as a delegation of lawmaking power without analyzing the problem of delegation in civil procedure more generally. See Richard A. Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the Structure of the Class Action, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 149, 191\u201398 (2003). More recently, Seth Davis has argued that, in certain cases, standing doctrine delegates to private parties the power to \u201cenforce the law.\u201d See Seth Davis, Standing Doctrine\u2019s State Action Problem, 91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 585, 600\u201307 (2015). But in contrast to this Article, Davis denies that the delegation extends to ordinary private lawsuits and does not consider other state powers that civil procedure delegates to private parties. See id. Davis\u2019s argument is discussed further below. See infra notes 68\u201375 and accompanying text. Along with comparativists and legal historians such as John Langbein, Stephen Yeazell has probably come the closest to offering a systematic account of the private exercise of power in civil litigation, though not the kind of theoretical framework developed in this Article. Yeazell\u2019s work is discussed throughout Part I, infra.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs public law scholars have recognized, delegating state power to private parties creates a risk that the power will be abused.[footnote]See infra note 140 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] The same risk exists in civil litigation, though the abuse assumes a different form in civil procedure than it does in the public law contexts on which scholars have primarily focused. While civil procedure generally abides a signifi\u00adcant amount of abuse in the name of \u201clitigant autonomy\u201d and other com\u00adpeting values, it sometimes deems an exercise of delegated power too objection\u00adable to tolerate. This Article shows that numerous procedural doctrines traditionally regarded as unrelated to one another actually per\u00adform the same general function of policing civil procedure\u2019s delegations for the most egregious forms of abuse.\r\n\r\nThose doctrines perform this policing function using several differ\u00adent strategies, which can be arrayed along a spectrum according to how much they interfere with private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated power. At one extreme, some doctrines <em>rescind<\/em> the delegation, putting state power back in the hands of state officials. Examples of this strategy include the appoint\u00adment of special masters to oversee discovery, the direct involve\u00adment of judges in settlement negotiations, and sua sponte dismissals. Other, subject-matter-specific examples include the right of the federal government to intervene in qui tam actions under the False Claims Act.[footnote]See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03730(b) (2012).[\/footnote] At the other extreme, some doctrines <em>punish<\/em> only especially egregious abuses of delegated power after they have already occurred\u2014either in the course of the litigation itself, as in the case of Rule 11 and discovery sanc\u00adtions, or in collateral proceedings, as in the case of tort actions for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. In between are doctrines that leave the delegations intact but allow courts to <em>withhold<\/em> enforcement from specific exercises of delegated power that contravene public values. The foremost examples of this strategy are courts\u2019 discretionary decisions refusing to compel discovery and quashing subpoenas, the constitutional ban on race-based peremptory challenges to prospective jurors in civil cases (so-called civil <em>Batson<\/em>),[footnote]See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 631 (1991).[\/footnote] and the line of procedural due process cases addressing State prejudgment attachment proceedings.[footnote]See infra note 198 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Article\u2019s first contribution, then, is to theorize civil procedure\u2019s response to the problem of delegated state power in ordinary civil litiga\u00adtion. A second contribution is to explicate the normative logic underly\u00ading civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines. According to that logic, the delegation-policing doctrines perform a function that this Article calls \u201ccomplicity avoidance.\u201d The basic idea, immanent in the civil <em>Batson<\/em> case and other case law, is that when a private party abuses delegated state power, she thereby renders the state <em>complicit<\/em> in her wrongdoing; civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines allow the state to avoid this complicity by disavowing a particular exercise of dele\u00adgated power that offends public values. The logic of complicity avoidance is rooted in liberal political theory, which undergirds the American constitutional order and its criteria for defining the legitimate exercise of political power.[footnote]This invocation of liberal political theory is orthogonal to the enduring debate over whether the U.S. Constitution\u2019s ideological underpinnings are \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201crepublican.\u201d See, e.g., Philip Hamburger, Liberality, 78 Tex. L. Rev. 1215, 1217\u201324 (2000) (reviewing the debate); Suzanna Sherry, Property Is the New Privacy: The Coming Constitutional Revolution, 128 Harv. L. Rev. 1452, 1458 n.21 (2015) (collecting sources on both sides of the debate). The answer is almost certainly \u201cboth.\u201d See, e.g., Jack M. Balkin, Which Republican Constitution?, 32 Const. Comment. 31, 35 (2017) (reviewing Randy E. Barnett, Our Republican Constitution: Securing the Liberty and Sovereignty of We the People (2016)) (\u201cThe American constitutional tradition, understood in its best sense, has always drawn on elements of <em>both<\/em> the republican and liberal traditions\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Indeed, many scholars have argued that the American varieties of liberalism and republicanism are largely reconcilable. See, e.g., 1 Bruce Ackerman, We the People: Foundations 29\u201332 (1991) (defending \u201cliberal republicanism\u201d). In any event, the specific element of liberal political theory on which this Article focuses\u2014its account of political power\u2014is sufficiently ecumenical to accord with a wide range of constitutional theories. For further discussion, see infra section III.D.1.[\/footnote] Most versions of liberalism hold that the state\u2019s coercive power is collectively authorized by the members of the political commu\u00adnity and exercised in their name. This creates the imperative for the state, acting on behalf of the political community, to repudiate objection\u00adable exercises of delegated power by private parties during civil litigation. On this account, liberal political theory provides a strong justification for the current shape of our civil justice system.\r\n\r\nThe theory of complicity avoidance also connects civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines to other, substantive legal doctrines that are similarly concerned with ensuring that public power does not end up facili\u00adtating objectionable private projects. The two foremost examples of the latter are <em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em>, which applied constitutional law\u2019s state action doctrine to prohibit courts from enforcing racially restrictive covenants,[footnote]334 U.S. 1, 19\u201321 (1948).[\/footnote] and contract law\u2019s unconscionability doctrine, as reconcep\u00adtualized by Seana Shiffrin.[footnote]See generally Seana Valentine Shiffrin, Paternalism, Unconscionability Doctrine, and Accommodation, 29 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff. 205 (2000) [hereinafter Shiffrin, Paternalism] (defending the unconscionability doctrine as a means by which courts can refuse to facilitate objectionable private conduct).[\/footnote] This Article thus shows civil proce\u00addure\u2019s delega\u00adtion prob\u00adlem to be but one manifestation of a much more pervasive problem that is addressed through substantive doctrines else\u00adwhere in the law.\r\n\r\nIn exploring civil procedure\u2019s delegations and its various strategies for policing them, this Article develops an analytical framework that bears on several pressing procedural problems. But here the focus is on the impli\u00adcations for perhaps the most urgent one: arbitration. One of the Article\u2019s main contentions is that the delegations in arbitration differ from the del\u00adegations in ordinary civil litigation in degree rather than kind.[footnote]Other scholars have noted certain functional similarities between ordinary civil litigation and arbitration but not the specific similarity analyzed in this Article. Resnik has long criticized what she views as the encroachment of the contract-based norms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) into ordinary civil litigation, through practices such as court-annexed ADR. See, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2806\u201307, 2844\u201350; Judith Resnik, Many Doors? Closing Doors? Alternative Dispute Resolution and Adjudication, 10 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 211, 212 (1995); Resnik, Privatization, supra note 6, at 1814; Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 622\u201323. This Article, by contrast, reverses the direction of the normative migration, conceiving of ADR as an extension of the delegations that have long been present in ordinary civil litigation.\r\nIn a similar vein, Richard Freer has recently argued that, with the demise of the civil trial, ordinary civil litigation has increasingly come to resemble arbitration, but in the specific sense that both now focus narrowly on the resolution of individual disputes and fail to realize the \u201cbroader goals and values\u201d traditionally associated with adjudication, such as governmental transparency, democratic participation, and law generation. Richard D. Freer, Exodus from and Transformation of American Civil Litigation, 65 Emory L.J. 1491, 1492 (2016). Moreover, in contrast to this Article, Freer attributes this convergence to various historical contingencies rather than to any fundamental feature of civil procedure, such as its delegation of many state dispute-resolution functions to private parties. See id. at 1493.[\/footnote] And yet, many proponents of the delegation critique advocate policy proposals for arbitration that differ from civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtion-policing doctrines in kind rather than degree. They tend, in particular, to seek to restrict arbitration\u2019s delegations, insisting either that courts deem broad categor\u00adies of arbitration clauses unenforceable, so as to channel many more disputes into public venues,[footnote]See, e.g., Radin, Fine Print, supra note 8, at 166\u201367, 173\u201374, 183; Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 441\u201343; Schwartz, Small Print, supra note 8, at 125\u201332; Jean R. Sternlight, Creeping Mandatory Arbitration: Is It Just?, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 1631, 1661\u201373 (2005) [hereinafter Sternlight, Mandatory Arbitration]; see also infra note 332 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] or that arbitrators be required to employ court-like procedures, so as to conform to the proce\u00addural norms of public adjudication.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 600 (insisting that arbitral \u201cprocesses have to look more like what courts do than not\u201d); Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1054\u2013100; Sternlight, Rethinking, supra note 9, at 80\u201397; see also infra note 334 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] These are reasonable responses, especially given the gross power asymmetries that produce the most controversial arbitration clauses. Nonetheless, even if courts leave arbitra\u00adtion\u2019s delegations largely intact, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines suggest an alterna\u00adtive approach that could render those dele\u00adgations less troubling\u2014more akin to the delegations we have come to accept in ordinary civil litigation.\r\n\r\nRather than restrict <em>access<\/em> to arbitration\u2019s delegations before any abuse has occurred, such an approach would focus on <em>policing<\/em> exercises of delegated power for abuse after the fact. More specifically, a delega\u00adtion-policing approach would address the abuse of delegated state power in arbitration by subjecting arbitrators\u2019 decisions to more searching judi\u00adcial scrutiny. That scrutiny could take a number of different forms, including allowing interlocutory review of key procedural decisions by arbitrators, more frequently granting motions to vacate (or more frequently refusing to confirm) arbitral awards that issue from proceed\u00adings marred by especially serious procedural or substantive defects, and even sanctioning parties who seek to confirm such awards. While some of these proposals would require amending the FAA, others could be implemented through more faithful judicial interpretations of the statute than the Supreme Court has rendered. To be sure, even robust ex post policing mechanisms would not solve all of the problems with arbitration; ex ante regulation might still be necessary to address some of the very worst abuses, such as class-arbitration bans.[footnote]See infra note 341 and accompanying text. But see Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 133 S. Ct. 2304, 2308\u201312 (2013) (holding that the FAA requires courts to enforce class-arbitration waivers); AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 351\u201352 (2011) (holding that the FAA preempted California\u2019s ban on class-arbitration waivers).[\/footnote] The point is that, even if arbitration clauses con\u00adtinue to be enforced more often than arbitration\u2019s critics think legitimate, both arbitral proceedings and awards should be subject to greater judicial scrutiny than current doctrine permits.\r\n\r\nAlthough other scholars have also called for this kind of enhanced judicial review, they typically present it as only one among many indiscrim\u00adinate limits on arbitration.[footnote]See infra notes 335\u2013336 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] What distinguishes a delegation-policing approach is that it sees ex post judicial review as a distinct strategy, one grounded in the same logic underlying the doctrines that respond to civil procedure\u2019s own delegation problem.\r\n\r\nThe Article proceeds as follows. Part I makes the case for concep\u00adtual\u00adizing the exercise of various dispute-resolution functions by private parties in ordinary civil litigation as a delegation of state power. Part\u00a0II then explains why civil procedure\u2019s delegations need to be policed and examines the different procedural doctrines that fill that role. Those doctrines, Part III shows, perform a complicity-avoidance function analo\u00adgous to that performed by various substantive doctrines\u2014a function that cannot be understood in standard due process terms. Turning to the implications for debates about arbitration, Part IV identifies several ways in which the delegations in arbitration can be policed, even if not eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion reflects on some of the Article\u2019s methodological impli\u00adcations. It contends that civil procedure scholars tend to underesti\u00admate the extent of civil procedure\u2019s delegations and to exaggerate the differences between arbitration and ordinary civil litigation because of the discipline\u2019s overreliance on the procedural due process framework, which is concerned with the procedures of state institutions rather than the exercise of state power by private parties. Greater attention to liberal political theory and its account of political power can help us to conceptualize many of the problems presented by the privatization of civil justice and to uncover solutions latent in civil procedure doctrine itself.\r\n<h2>I. Civil Procedure\u2019s Delegations<\/h2>\r\nIn criticizing arbitration for \u201cprivatizing\u201d or \u201coutsourcing\u201d dispute resolution, proponents of the delegation critique assume a traditional conception of ordinary civil litigation as being part of \u201ca rigidly indepen\u00addent public legal system.\u201d[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 45; see also Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2806 (noting that typically, \u201c[c]ourts are equated with public processes\u201d).[\/footnote] There are many different senses in which our civil justice system might be considered \u201cpublic.\u201d But for purposes of the delegation critique (and hence this Article), the most important is that \u201c[c]ourts are seen as\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. proceeding under a system not of their users\u2019 personal design but fashioned by bodies of rule-makers committed to procedural neutrality and subjected to public scrutiny.\u201d[footnote]Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2834.[\/footnote] Civil litigation, on this view, is public insofar as it is administered by state institutions\u2014courts\u2014that, in turn, proceed according to state-made rules.[footnote]See, e.g., Owen M. Fiss, The Supreme Court, 1978 Term\u2014Foreword: The Forms of Justice, 93 Harv. L.

The traditional conception actually conflates two distinct issues. The first is the nature of the functions performed in the course of resolving private disputes.[footnote]Cf. Metzger, supra note 4, at 1424 (arguing that an \u201cinquiry into the nature of the powers exercised by private entities\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is essential given the way that privatization not only enhances private actors\u2019 power over others, but provides them with forms of authority conventionally understood to constitute government power\u201d).[\/footnote] On that issue this Article agrees with proponents of the delega\u00adtion critique\u2014and will argue in more detail in this Part\u2014that binding \u201cdispute-resolution services constitute an inherently govern\u00admental func\u00adtion,\u201d and indeed \u201can aspect of sovereignty.\u201d[footnote]Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe second issue is <em>who<\/em> actually performs the various dispute-reso\u00adlution functions involved in ordinary civil litigation. Given the scholarly rhetoric extolling the \u201cpublic\u201d nature of our civil justice system, one might be tempted to think that those functions are performed exclu\u00adsively by state officials and institutions.[footnote]To be sure, civil procedure scholars have criticized certain aspects of contem\u00adporary civil litigation, such as contract procedure and court-annexed ADR, as forms of \u201cprivatization.\u201d But they depict these features as departures from, and corruptions of, ordinary civil litigation\u2019s fundamentally public nature. See supra notes 10, 26.[\/footnote] Scholars have, however, long recognized that civil procedure puts various powers in the hands of private parties rather than judges.[footnote]See, e.g., David A. Sklansky &amp; Stephen C. Yeazell, Comparative Law Without Leaving Home: What Civil Procedure Can Teach Criminal Procedure, and Vice Versa, 94 Geo. L.J. 683, 684 (2006) (\u201cCivil litigation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. has been essentially privatized\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] This Part argues that many of these private exercises of power in ordinary civil litigation should be concep\u00adtualized as <em>delegations<\/em> of state power.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this Part contends that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure delegate state power to private parties in the following func\u00adtional sense: At various points in the litigation, the Rules enable the par\u00adties to force the court to deploy coercive power for their own purposes. The Rules may technically interpose a state official in some of those instances, such that the parties cannot be said to <em>formally<\/em> wield coercive power, but the official nevertheless has little or no discretion to preempt the parties\u2019 decisions, such that the parties <em>effectively<\/em> wield coercive power in the first instance.[footnote]This is different from the claim that the Federal Rules allow litigants to engage in \u201crulemaking,\u201d in the sense of selecting the procedural rules that will govern their dispute. See Robert G. Bone, Party Rulemaking: Making Procedural Rules Through Party Choice, 90 Tex. L. Rev. 1329, 1342\u201352 (2012) [hereinafter Bone, Party Rulemaking]; see also Stephen C. Yeazell, Civil Procedure 138 (7th ed. 2008) (noting that many procedural rules are merely \u201cdefault rules\u201d); Robin J. Effron, Ousted: The New Dynamics of Privatized Procedure and Judicial Discretion, 98 B.U. L. Rev. 127, 141\u201344 (2018) (cataloging the various ways in which the Federal Rules defer to party \u201cpreference\u201d or \u201cagreement\u201d). By contrast, this Article contends that the Rules sometimes allow litigants (either formally or effectively) to exercise the state\u2019s coercive power, whether through \u201crulemaking\u201d or otherwise.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSection I.A briefly elaborates this Article\u2019s conception of a delega\u00adtion of state power. Section I.B then examines three of the most notable delegations in civil procedure, while section I.C considers two general objections to conceptualizing any part of ordinary civil litigation as a del\u00adegation of state power.\r\n<h3>A. Defining Delegation<\/h3>\r\nTo determine when the state delegates power to private parties, we can use either a narrow, formal conception of a delegation or a broader, functional one. On the formal conception, the state delegates power when it authorizes a private party to act on its behalf with respect to other private parties, as when the government contracts with a private entity to administer a public benefits program. This is the prevailing con\u00adception among public law scholars[footnote]See, e.g., Metzger, supra note 4, at 1456, 1462\u201370 (arguing that the creation of an agency relationship is the most significant criterion for identifying a delegation of state power); Jed Rubenfeld, Privatization, State Action, and Title IX: Do Campus Sexual Assault Hearings Violate Due Process? 25 n.132 (Yale Law Sch., Pub. Law Research Paper No. 588, 2016), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2857153 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (consider\u00ading state action \u201ccases in which government uses private parties for its own ends\u2014i.e., when it delegates powers to private parties but continues to direct their objectives\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014and for understandable reasons. For one thing, \u201cdelegation\u201d is a loaded (and, at least in public law con\u00adtexts, largely pejorative) term, so it makes sense to reserve that label for situations that are thought to raise the most serious concerns. For another, by cabining the category of delegations, we can avoid the sweep\u00ading implication that <em>all<\/em> power held by private parties is delegated state power, which would threaten to eliminate any distinction between state authority and private ordering.[footnote]See Metzger, supra note 4, at 1462 &amp; n.326; see also infra note 47 (discussing the realist critique of the public\u2013private distinction).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe functional conception of a delegation, by contrast, does not look for an agency relationship between the state and a private party but rather focuses on who controls the application of coercive power as a practical matter, regardless of who holds it as a formal matter. On this view, a private party is delegated state power when she can prompt a state official or institution to coerce another private party without the official\u2019s or institution\u2019s first having an opportunity to assess the grounds on which the coercion is being exercised. Although the coercive power may for\u00admally be vested with the state rather than the private party, the private party alone determines its initial application, and so effectively holds the power in the first instance.\r\n\r\nWhile we should appreciate the risks associated with expanding the notion of a delegation, it is nevertheless useful to conceptualize such pri\u00advately initiated exercises of coercion as delegations of state power. Only by doing so can we make sense of the delegation critique of arbitration, which presupposes the broader conception of a delegation. As we shall see, the current arbitration regime does not formally authorize private parties\u2019 chosen arbitrators to reach binding resolutions of private disputes; rather, it effectively renders arbitrators\u2019 decisions binding by requiring courts to enforce them without any meaningful review.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.1.[\/footnote] Arbi\u00adtration thus delegates (or \u201cprivatizes\u201d) state power only in the functional sense.\r\n\r\nThe functional delegations, moreover, raise the same normative con\u00adcerns as the formal ones. State power is distinguished by its coercive\u00adness,[footnote]See infra section III.D.1; see also, e.g., David M. Lawrence, Private Exercise of Governmental Power, 61 Ind. L.J. 647, 647\u201348 (1986) (identifying \u201cgovernmental\u201d powers in terms of the exercise of coercion). But cf. Lillian BeVier &amp; John Harrison, The State Action Principle and Its Critics, 96 Va. L. Rev. 1767, 1785 (2010) (distinguishing state action according to \u201cthe presence or absence of a decisive choice by a private person,\u201d rather than the presence or absence of coercion). Without wading into longstanding philosophical debates about the nature of coercion, this Article accepts that state power is coercive in the sense that the state \u201ctypically backs its commands and prohibitions with the credible threat of brute force or other sanctions in the event of noncompliance.\u201d Frederick Schauer, The Force of Law 5 (2015).[\/footnote] but the state can enable private parties to exercise coercion other than by formally making them its agents. That is perhaps no more true than in civil procedure. What makes the various dispute-resolution powers involved in civil litigation \u201cinherently governmental\u201d or \u201caspect[s] of sovereignty\u201d[footnote]Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535.[\/footnote] is the fact that they are <em>binding<\/em>\u2014immediately backed by coercion.[footnote]Cf. Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 375 (1971) (recognizing \u201cthe State\u2019s monopoly over techniques for binding conflict resolution\u201d).[\/footnote] As Part III explains more fully, liberal political theory has tra\u00additionally conceived of the state as possessing a monopoly on the legiti\u00admate use of coercion. And indeed, the next section shows that the coer\u00adcive dispute-resolution powers in civil litigation are the kinds of powers that have traditionally been exercised by the state and that continue to be exercised by the state in other contexts. Yet the next section also iden\u00adtifies a number of significant points in civil litigation at which private par\u00adties initially determine the application of coercive power. These privately initiated exercises of coercion test the limits of the traditional liberal con\u00adception of the state just as much as formal conferrals of authority to act on the state\u2019s behalf do, and thus equally merit the \u201cdelegation\u201d label.[footnote]By contrast, even on this functional account, extralegal, custom-based regimes of dispute resolution do not involve a delegation of state power. See generally, e.g., Robert C. Ellickson, Order Without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes (1994) (using disputes between cattle ranchers in Shasta County, California, to demonstrate how neighbors often rely on social norms, rather than the formal legal system, to resolve disputes); Lisa Bernstein, Opting Out of the Legal System: Extralegal Contractual Relations in the Diamond Industry, 21 J. Legal Stud. 115 (1992) (explaining how the diamond industry has established its own dispute-resolution system independent of any state-run legal system).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSome might worry that the functional conception of a delegation proves too much, implying that all de facto power held by one private party over another is delegated state power. While that might follow if the state delegated power simply by enforcing, or giving effect to, private parties\u2019 choices, the functional conception of a delegation requires some\u00adthing more. When the state makes itself available to coercively enforce certain private choices, it generally retains broad discretion to set the terms on which it will provide that support; think, for instance, of the intricate legal regime governing the enforcement of private contracts.[footnote]Cf. Margaret Jane Radin, Boilerplate: A Threat to the Rule of Law?, <em>in<\/em> Private Law and the Rule of Law 288, 300 (Lisa M. Austin &amp; Dennis Klimchuk eds., 2014) [hereinafter Radin, Threat] (arguing that the state\u2019s coercive \u201c[e]nforcement of exchanges by private ordering\u201d is legitimated by a \u201cbackground legal infrastructure\u201d that leaves the state with significant discretion to scrutinize the voluntariness and substance of private agreements).[\/footnote] The examples considered in this Article go much further: As the next section shows, the Federal Rules often effectively <em>require<\/em> courts to exer\u00adcise coercive power at private parties\u2019 behest, denying them any meaning\u00adful discretion to withhold that coercion, at least as an initial matter. One can recognize those instances as delegations without having to maintain that the state delegates power whenever it supports private ordering.[footnote]Thus, even as this Article seeks to broaden the notion of a delegation, it still main\u00adtains a distinction between \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d\u2014a distinction legal realists have famously dismissed as illusory. For prominent contemporary versions of that criticism, see Louis Michael Seidman &amp; Mark V. Tushnet, Remnants of Belief: Contemporary Constitutional Issues 61\u201367 (1996) (arguing that, given the conceptual confusion surrounding the public\u2013private distinction, \u201cthe state action analysis ought to be abandoned altogether\u201d); Cass R. Sunstein, The Partial Constitution 351\u201353 (1993) [hereinafter Sunstein, Partial Constitution] (discussing the state\u2019s role in setting the legal baselines against which private ordering occurs). Notwithstanding the force of the realist critique, the public\u2013private distinction remains an enduring feature of legal practice and scholarship and indeed a \u201cfoundational premise of our constitutional order.\u201d Metzger, supra note 4, at 1369\u201370; see also, e.g., Radin, Fine Print, supra note 8, at 36 (\u201c[O]ur society\u2019s underlying commitment to the idea of private ordering, which is embedded in our legal infrastructure of contract, unequivocally relies on the existence of a distinction between the realms of public and private action and ordering\u2014a public\/private distinction.\u201d); J.M. Balkin, Populism and Progressivism as Constitutional Categories, 104 Yale L.J. 1935, 1968\u201369 (1995) (reviewing Cass R. Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech (1993)) (suggesting that, rather than \u201cabolish the distinctions between concepts like public and private,\u201d we should \u201cunderstand these boundaries as more flexible\u201d); cf. Jody Freeman, The Private Role in Public Governance, 75 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 543, 551 (2000) (conceding that \u201cthe particular coercive power of the state\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is undeniable\u201d even while endorsing the realist critique of the public\u2013private distinction). That is perhaps no more apparent than in the delegation critique of arbitration itself, which presupposes fairly distinct public and private spheres and purports to distinguish between public and private exercises of state power. This Article thus assumes the distinction\u2019s validity.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. Delegated Procedural Powers<\/h3>\r\nThis section contends that three of the most significant aspects of ordinary civil litigation today\u2014prosecution, discovery, and settlement\u2014involve delegations of state power. At each of those stages, the Federal Rules effectively allow private parties to exercise coercive powers over others without prior judicial approval. There is a tendency, moreover, to deem those same powers \u201cpublic\u201d when exercised by state officials in other contexts; they remain public when exercised by private parties in the course of ordinary civil litigation.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Prosecution<\/em>. \u2014 From the very outset of a lawsuit, the Federal Rules vest private parties with significant power. Rather than charge state offi\u00adcials with prosecuting civil claims or require victims to vet their claims with state institutions before filing suit, the Rules generally authorize \u201caggrieved victims of wrongs to enlist the adjudicative machinery of the state in seeking redress.\u201d[footnote]Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 687. There are a number of notable exceptions to this general rule for certain kinds of claims. See David Freeman Engstrom, Agencies as Litigation Gatekeepers, 123 Yale L.J. 616, 644\u201355 (2013) [hereinafter Engstrom, Litigation Gatekeepers] (discussing instances in which administrative agencies serve as \u201cgatekeepers,\u201d screening legal claims before potential plaintiffs may proceed to court).[\/footnote] Civil procedure scholars have, for the most part, failed to closely analyze the nature of the civil prosecutorial power,[footnote]An important, if limited, exception is the extensive body of scholarship on the \u201cprivate enforcement\u201d of public regulatory laws. See infra note 291 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] but it has garnered more attention from proponents of the \u201ccivil recourse\u201d theory of tort law. One of civil recourse theory\u2019s main claims is that \u201c[t]ort law\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is about empowering <em>private parties<\/em> to initiate pro\u00adceed\u00adings designed to hold tortfeasors accountable.\u201d[footnote]John C.P. Goldberg &amp; Benjamin C. Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs, 88 Tex. L. Rev. 917, 946\u201347 (2010) [hereinafter Goldberg &amp; Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs]; see also Benjamin C. Zipursky, Civil Recourse, Not Corrective Justice, 91 Geo. L.J. 695, 720\u201321, 735 (2003) [hereinafter Zipursky, Civil Recourse] (noting that defendants in tort suits are under no legal obligation to pay damages until a plaintiff has brought suit and secured a verdict in her favor). At times, Goldberg and Zipursky appear to argue that plaintiffs possess not just a prosecutorial power to initiate a lawsuit but also a remedial power to \u201cexact\u201d or take something from the wrongdoer should they prevail on their claims. See, e.g., Goldberg &amp; Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs, supra, at 919; Zipursky, Civil Recourse, supra, at 718\u201319. The latter would arguably constitute another significant delegation of state power, but the claim is controversial, and this Article does not pursue it as an example of delegation in ordinary civil litigation.[\/footnote] Replace \u201ctortfeasors\u201d with \u201cwrongdoers,\u201d and this claim actually describes a power enjoyed by all potential civil plaintiffs, not just tort plaintiffs.[footnote]See Arthur Ripstein, Private Wrongs 271\u201372 (2016) [hereinafter Ripstein, Private Wrongs]; John Gardner, Torts and Other Wrongs, 39 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 43, 47 (2011); Scott Hershovitz, Harry Potter and the Trouble with Tort Theory, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 67, 102 n.105 (2010); Ori J. Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, 65 U. Toronto L.J. 99, 109 (2015) [hereinafter Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers]; Gregory C. Keating, The Priority of Respect over Repair, 18 Legal Theory 293, 312 (2012). Indeed, civil recourse theorists have basically conceded the point, see, e.g., John C.P. Goldberg &amp; Benjamin C. Zipursky, Civil Recourse Revisited, 39 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 341, 348\u201354 (2011); Zipursky, Civil Recourse, supra note 50, at 734, and some scholars have attempted to extend civil recourse theory beyond tort law, see, e.g., Nathan B. Oman, Consent to Retaliation: A Civil Recourse Theory of Contractual Liability, 96 Iowa L. Rev. 529, 531\u201334 (2010) (developing a civil recourse account of contract law).[\/footnote] More precisely, Ori Herstein, a sympathetic critic of civil recourse theory, has explained that a civil plaintiff\u2019s ability to initiate a lawsuit includes both (1) a Hohfeldian <em>power<\/em> to subject another private party to the judicial process and to the courts\u2019 authority to alter the parties\u2019 legal rights and (2) a Hohfeldian <em>privilege<\/em> to decide whether to exercise that power.[footnote]Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, supra note 51, at 104, 109; see also Zipursky, Civil Recourse, supra note 50, at 741 (\u201cA right of action is a privilege and a power\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). See generally Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning (Walter Wheeler Cook ed., 1919) (distinguishing between various juridical relations, including privileges and powers).[\/footnote] That combination means that private parties, rather than state officials, generally get to decide who will be subject to the courts\u2019 authority to adjudicate civil claims.\r\n\r\nThe power to initiate a lawsuit, while significant, is not in itself coer\u00adcive. But the Rules go a step further, backing that power with an addi\u00adtional, coercive power. Rule 4 provides: \u201cOn or after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal. If the summons is properly completed, the clerk <em>must<\/em> sign, seal, and issue it to the plaintiff for service on the defendant.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(b) (emphasis added).[\/footnote] This effectively grants plain\u00adtiffs the power not only to initiate the judicial process but also to hale their opponents into court. To be sure, given the role of the court clerk in issu\u00ading the summons, the latter power technically amounts to a Hohfeldian <em>claim right<\/em> on the part of the plaintiff to have the state exer\u00adcise <em>its<\/em> power to hale people into court.[footnote]Cf. Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, supra note 51, at 121 (\u201c[Tort] victims hold a claim against the court to exercise its own legal power over tortfeasors in accordance with the victims\u2019 rights for redress.\u201d).[\/footnote] But that claim right is essen\u00adtially absolute, for the clerk has no discretion to withhold the summons so long as the plaintiff\u2019s complaint satisfies the necessary formalities.[footnote]See 4A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a01084, at 614 &amp; n.5 (4th ed. 2015). Rather than require a clerk\u2019s signature, some States even allow a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer to sign the summons. See id. at 614\u201315 &amp; n.6.[\/footnote] In substance, then, if not in form, the Federal Rules assign the power to hale others into court to private parties rather than state officials.\r\n\r\nThat power is coercive.[footnote]See Barbara Allen Babcock et al., Civil Procedure: Cases and Problems 104 (4th ed. 2009) (\u201c[B]ehind that innocent-looking piece of paper titled \u2018Summons\u2019 stands the full coercive power of the State.\u201d).[\/footnote] Once the summons issues and the plaintiff properly attempts to serve it on the defendant, the defendant must enter an appearance in the action, on pain of default.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a).[\/footnote] The Rules thus empower a plaintiff to order other parties to appear in court and then to compel the court to coercively enforce that order\u2014all virtually on the plaintiff\u2019s own say-so.[footnote]The unilateral nature of this power has led at least one scholar to argue, on various doctrinal grounds, that Rule 4 is unconstitutional. See E. Donald Elliott, <em>Twombly<\/em> in Context: Why Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(b) Is Unconstitutional, 64 Fla. L. Rev. 895, 911\u201357 (2012).[\/footnote] The effects of that coercion for the defendant can be significant, including the expense of hiring a lawyer and exposure to public scrutiny, as well as more formal legal consequences such as pre\u00adjudgment attach\u00adment of property.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 64.[\/footnote] On the other hand, the coercion may be relatively ephemeral; a spurious complaint can be dismissed fairly quickly,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12.[\/footnote] and even a default or default judgment can, in certain circum\u00adstances, be set aside.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c).[\/footnote] The point is that the named defendant must generally appear before the court to get the complaint dismissed or the default or default judgment set aside, a burden imposed by the unilat\u00aderal, unsupervised actions of the plaintiff.[footnote]The liberal rules of permissive joinder and third-party impleader only augment the plaintiff\u2019s prosecutorial power, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 13, 14, 18, 20\u2014especially considering how much latitude plaintiffs enjoy in deciding whom to join, see Stephen C. Yeazell, The Misunderstood Consequences of Modern Civil Process, 1994 Wis. L. Rev. 631, 654 [hereinafter Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nA number of considerations confirm that the coercive power to hale others into court is a delegated state power. For one, we tend to associate the power to compel individuals to appear before state bodies with the state itself. That association is partly a product of history. Throughout much of the nineteenth century, American courts had discretion to review the substance of a plaintiff\u2019s pleadings before issuing a sum\u00admons.[footnote]See Elliott, supra note 58, at 914\u201321.[\/footnote] One finds formal vestiges of this history in the Federal Rules: Though instigated at the plaintiff\u2019s sole discretion, a summons issues in the name of the court. It is formally the court, not the plaintiff, that orders the defendant to appear.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(F)\u2013(G) (requiring that a summons \u201cbe signed by the clerk\u201d and \u201cbear the court\u2019s seal\u201d).[\/footnote] And it is formally the court, not the plaintiff, that coercively enforces that order with a default judgment.[footnote]Specifically, when the defendant fails to appear and the plaintiff seeks to recover \u201ca sum certain,\u201d the court clerk \u201c<em>must<\/em>\u201d enter a default judgment if the plaintiff so requests. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1) (emphasis added). By contrast, when the plaintiff seeks an amount that is not certain, or when the defendant appears after having failed to answer the complaint, the court has broader discretion to decide whether to enter a default judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2).[\/footnote] The Rules thus formally profess state authorship over the very same pow\u00aders that they functionally put in the hands of private parties, one of the hallmarks of a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\nFor another, most agree on the public nature of the <em>criminal<\/em> prose\u00adcu\u00adtorial power\u2014the power to decide who must answer for alleged criminal conduct and to compel those individuals to appear in court.[footnote]To be sure, private parties prosecuted criminal actions throughout most of English history. See John H. Langbein, Ren\u00e9e Lettow Lerner &amp; Bruce P. Smith, History of the Common Law: The Development of Anglo-American Legal Institutions 29\u201335, 578\u201389 (2009). And while the United States introduced public prosecutors early in its history, the practice of private prosecution persisted in certain quarters well into the nineteenth century. See id. at 746\u201349. But for at least a century, the prevailing view has been that criminal prosecution is exclusively a state function. See Roger A. Fairfax, Jr., Delegation of the Criminal Prosecution Function to Private Actors, 43 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 411, 413 (2009) (\u201cMost observers reasonably view criminal prosecution as a function to be performed exclusively by the state.\u201d).[\/footnote] While the criminal prosecutorial power may have more significant conse\u00adquences for defendants than the civil prosecutorial power,[footnote]Most notably, criminal prosecution exposes defendants to potential criminal punishment, whereas civil prosecution exposes defendants only to potential civil remedies.[\/footnote] both ulti\u00admately reduce to the power to coercively hale people into court to answer for alleged wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nOne might resist this analogy on the ground that civil litigation typi\u00adcally redresses private wrongs, as opposed to the public wrongs redressed through the criminal law and certain regulatory-style civil actions. More specifically, even conceding that the state delegates power when it autho\u00adrizes private parties to bring criminal prosecutions, as well as certain civil enforcement actions, in its stead, one might still deny that any delegation extends to ordinary lawsuits seeking to vindicate private law rights, such as tort and contract actions. Seth Davis\u2019s \u201cstate action\u201d theory of standing doctrine is a sophisticated example of this position. According to Davis, \u201c[s]tanding involves a government power when it authorizes a litigant to act on a government\u2019s behalf to vindicate a government interest.\u201d[footnote]Davis, supra note 18, at 590; cf. Metzger, supra note 4, at 1456 (\u201c[T]he central criterion for singling out particular private delegations for enhanced scrutiny is whether they authorize private entities to act on the government\u2019s behalf, a factor usually established by assessing whether the requirements of agency are met.\u201d).[\/footnote] \u201cStand\u00ading does not,\u201d by contrast, \u201cdelegate the public power to enforce the law where it satisfies the government\u2019s obligation to provide remedies to redress personal wrongs and to keep government accounta\u00adble, even if the litigant\u2019s action would vindicate a public right.\u201d[footnote]Davis, supra note 18, at 591. But cf. Sean Farhang, The Litigation State: Public Regulation and Private Lawsuits in the U.S. 8 (2010) (\u201cThe standing statutorily conferred on private actors to enforce public regulatory laws in court effectively licenses them to wield the coercive instruments of state power.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is important to emphasize that Davis focuses on only one aspect of the civil prosecutorial power. In using the term \u201cstanding,\u201d Davis is refer\u00adring simply to the right of a specific plaintiff to bring a specific claim against a specific defendant.[footnote]See Davis, supra note 18, at 595.[\/footnote] The notion of governmental authorization does indeed offer a plausible test for determining when the exercise of that right involves a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\nBut as we have seen, the right to initiate a lawsuit does not exhaust the civil prosecutorial power in the American civil justice system; the Federal Rules also effectively grant plaintiffs the power to hale defend\u00adants into court, on pain of default. This power, which Davis does not sep\u00adarately consider, is equally present even in cases Davis deems \u201cprivate,\u201d in which private parties are not authorized to vindicate a governmental interest. One need not maintain that \u201cprivate standing and government standing are synonymous\u201d[footnote]Id. at 601.[\/footnote] or \u201cgive[] short shrift to [standing\u2019s] role in realizing rights to remedies\u201d[footnote]Id. at 604.[\/footnote] to recognize that all civil cases involve this limited (though still significant) delegation, even if a narrower subset of civil cases involve an <em>additional<\/em> delegation of the power to enforce the law on the government\u2019s behalf.\r\n\r\nDavis appears to want to cabin the delegation involved in the civil prosecutorial power because he believes that any delegation of state power entails a duty on the part of the private party exercising the dele\u00adgated power to subordinate her own private interests to public values.[footnote]See id. at 601\u201304.[\/footnote] Such a duty, Davis suggests, would be inappropriate in ordinary private law cases, in which plaintiffs should have wide latitude to pursue their own interests in seeking a remedy, without regard to public values.[footnote]See id.; cf. BeVier &amp; Harrison, supra note 42, at 1785 (premising constitutional law\u2019s state action requirement \u201con the thesis that private individuals are principals, entitled to act to pursue their own interests, whereas government decisionmakers are agents, whose function is to further the interests of the citizens\u201d).[\/footnote] Davis purports to derive this limitation from civil recourse theory,[footnote]See Davis, supra note 18, at 601\u201304.[\/footnote] yet civil recourse theorists themselves use the language of delegation to describe the civil prosecutorial power.[footnote]See, e.g., Benjamin C. Zipursky, Torts and the Rule of Law, <em>in<\/em> Private Law and the Rule of Law, supra note 46, at 139, 148 (referring to \u201cthe power the state <em>affords to<\/em> private individual litigants\u201d (emphasis added)).[\/footnote] More to the point, as the next Part shows, civil procedure already requires plaintiffs to restrain their use of the civil prosecutorial power for the sake of certain public values, even when they are not authorized to act on the government\u2019s behalf but are instead permitted to pursue their own interests. Unsurprisingly, these restrictions are significantly less demanding than the restrictions Davis would impose on plaintiffs standing in for the government as law enforcer; after all, the power to enforce the law is typically an even more solemn state power than the power to coercively hale people into court. But while the latter delegation may be less significant than the former, it remains a delegation nonetheless.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Discovery<\/em>. \u2014 The Federal Rules do not cease delegating state power once the plaintiff has summoned the defendant to appear in court. On the contrary, the state continues to delegate significant coer\u00adcive power to both parties throughout the most consequential stage of civil litigation: discovery. Civil procedure scholars have long recognized that discovery is carried out primarily by the parties and their lawyers rather than the court;[footnote]See, e.g., Arthur R. Miller, Simplified Pleading, Meaningful Days in Court, and Trials on the Merits: Reflections on the Deformation of Federal Procedure, 88 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 286, 353 (2013) [hereinafter Miller, Simplified Pleading]; Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences, supra note 62, at 651.[\/footnote] it makes sense to conceptualize this feature of civil litigation, too, as a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\nThe structure of that delegation mirrors the structure of the delega\u00adtion involved in the civil prosecutorial power. Just as the Rules grant plaintiffs the power to order defendants to appear in court, so they grant both parties the power to order each other, as well as nonparties, to disclose information. As the Supreme Court observed less than a decade after the promulgation of the Rules, \u201c[e]ither party may compel the other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession.\u201d[footnote]Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507 (1947).[\/footnote] What was then true only functionally became true formally in 1970, when Rule 34 was amended to eliminate the (oft-ignored) requirement of a court order for discovery requests; the amendment authorized a party to directly request from the other party any document or object within the scope of discovery specified in Rule 26.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a). As the Advisory Committee explained, the point of the amendment was to have Rule 34 \u201coperate extrajudicially, rather than by court order.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1970 amendment.[\/footnote] One party can also demand that the other answer up to twenty-five interrogatories without a court order.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 33.[\/footnote] A party\u2019s discovery powers extend over not only the other party but nonparties as well. Under Rule 45, a party can subpoena a nonparty to pro\u00adduce any discoverable documents or objects in her possession.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(c) (\u201cAs provided in Rule 45, a nonparty may be compelled to produce documents and tangible things or to permit an inspection.\u201d).[\/footnote] A party can also subpoena \u201cany person\u201d (including the other party) to \u201ccom\u00adpel[]\u201d her attendance at a deposition.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(1) (oral examination); Fed. R. Civ. P. 31(a)(1) (written ques\u00adtions); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(1). A party must seek the court\u2019s permission to con\u00adduct more than ten depositions (unless the parties stipulate to more). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(A)(i).[\/footnote] A subpoena technically issues in the name of the court but is drafted by the party or her lawyer and is signed either by the lawyer or the court clerk, who must leave the sub\u00adpoena \u201cotherwise in blank.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(3).[\/footnote] At a deposition, a party can compel the deponent to answer any question that does not require the disclosure of privileged information, notwithstanding any objections (which are merely \u201cnoted on the record\u201d).[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2). Although a deposition must technically be taken before an \u201cofficer,\u201d that person is usually just a stenographer or notary public who lacks authority to rule on objections or adjudicate disputes between the parties. Fed. R. Civ. P. 28.[\/footnote] Time and time again, the Federal Rules allow the parties to order others to disclose information without prior judicial approval.[footnote]To be sure, at various points, the Rules encourage the parties to cooperate in plan\u00adning and conducting discovery. See Effron, supra note 38, at 138\u201348. But such cooperation typically does not involve nonparties, and it occurs (if at all) in the shadow of the coercive power that the Rules delegate to each party.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs with the civil prosecutorial power, the Rules back the parties\u2019 dis\u00adcovery powers with the coercive power of the state\u2014and once again leave courts with little control over how that power is wielded in the first instance. If one party refuses to comply with another party\u2019s discovery request, the party who made the request can move for a court order com\u00adpelling disclosure on pain of sanctions.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)\u2013(b).[\/footnote] This forces the resistant party to either oppose the motion or turn over the requested information; she cannot simply sit back and ignore the other party\u2019s demands, lest she be sanctioned for noncompliance. The parties enjoy even more direct con\u00adtrol over the state\u2019s coercive power with respect to discovery involving nonparties. A subpoena issued by a party under Rule 45 (whether signed by the party\u2019s lawyer or the clerk) is treated as an order of the court,[footnote]9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a02453, at 396 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cAlthough an attorney-issued subpoena is in a sense merely the command of the attorney who completes the form, noncompliance with a subpoena by the recipient is an act in defiance of a court order.\u201d).[\/footnote] with noncompliance punishable as contempt.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(g).[\/footnote] Although a nonparty can move to quash a subpoena,[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3).[\/footnote] she must take that affirmative step or otherwise face coercive sanctions simply because of the issuing party\u2019s unilat\u00aderal actions.\r\n\r\nWe should be careful not to overstate the extent of the powers exer\u00adcised by private parties during discovery. Those powers have undoubtedly waned since 1938, as \u201csuccessive amendments to the Federal Rules ha[ve] impressed limits on the extent of discovery.\u201d[footnote]Arthur R. Miller, From <em>Conley<\/em> to <em>Twombly<\/em> to <em>Iqbal<\/em>: A Double Play on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 60 Duke L.J. 1, 52 (2010) [hereinafter Miller, Double Play]; see also Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 353\u201356 (discussing changes to the discovery rules in the late twentieth century).[\/footnote] Rule 26, for instance, was amended in 2015 to prohibit discovery that is not \u201cpropor\u00adtional to the needs of the case.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). The impact of the 2015 amendments to the discovery rules will depend on individual judges\u2019 willingness to employ the largely discretionary tools they authorize. See Morris A. Ratner, Restraining Lawyers: From \u201cCases\u201d to \u201cTasks,\u201d 85 Fordham L. Rev. 2151, 2167 (2017) (discussing the potential impact of the amend\u00adments on judicial case management); see also Andrew S. Pollis, Busting up the Pretrial Industry, 85 Fordham L. Rev. 2097, 2115 (2017) (expressing concern that the amendments leave judges with too much discretion over discovery). Some scholars have criticized the amendments, and particularly the proportionality requirement, as \u201canti-plaintiff.\u201d See, e.g., Patricia Hatamyar Moore, The Anti-Plaintiff Pending Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Pro-Defendant Composition of the Federal Rulemaking Committees, 83 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1083, 1085\u201386 (2015) (arguing that various amendments to the Federal Rules over the last few decades have disadvantaged plaintiffs).[\/footnote] Notwithstanding the increasing limits on discovery, however, it remains the case that parties still enjoy signifi\u00adcant power to compel others to produce information without much judicial involve\u00adment.[footnote]See Amalia D. Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition: Equity Procedure, Due Process, and the Search for an Alternative to the Adversarial, 90 Cornell L. Rev. 1181, 1256 (2005) [hereinafter Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition] (\u201c[D]espite the widely recognized problems with party control of discovery, the attempts we have made to pro\u00advide greater court control have been fairly limited\u2014authorizing judges to hold scheduling conferences and to appoint pretrial discovery masters, but leaving primary responsibility with the parties.\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, \u201cfrom a comparative perspective [the dis\u00adcovery power in American civil litigation] is broader and deeper than the powers exercised by private lawyers in any other legal system.\u201d[footnote]Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 694.[\/footnote] While private parties\u2019 discovery powers may have been curbed, they have not been eliminated.[footnote]This Article considers the implications of increased \u201cmanagerial judging\u201d sepa\u00adrately below. See infra section I.C.2.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBut why understand these powers as delegated <em>state <\/em>powers? Perhaps as much as any other civil procedure scholar, Stephen Yeazell has pointed toward an answer, and his account is worth quoting at length:\r\n<blockquote>Discovery empowers litigants. In a civil law system litigants can only attempt to persuade a judge to seek information from the parties or others. American law, on the other hand, allows the litigants to demand information and testimony and backs those demands with legal sanctions. From such a comparative standpoint, the power delegated to ordinary litigants by the American discovery system is astounding. Ordinary civil litigants receive state sanction to require documents, depose witnesses under oath, and more. The penalties for noncompliance are substantial, including not only consequences to a litigant within the lawsuit, but also extending to possible imprisonment or fines of non-party witness[es] who fail to comply. We have put in the hands of civil litigants powers that in many legal systems only state officials enjoy.[footnote]Stephen C. Yeazell, Socializing Law, Privatizing Law, Monopolizing Law, Accessing Law, 39 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 691, 699 (2006); see also Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 694\u201395 (similar). For an unfavorable comparison of the American system of lawyer-driven discovery with civil law systems, see John H. Langbein, The German Advantage in Civil Procedure, 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 823, 823\u201324 (1985).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nTo wit, in most other Western liberal democracies, judges exercise the very same discovery powers that private parties exercise in our civil justice system.[footnote]And if not judges, then administrative agencies. See Paul D. Carrington, Renovating Discovery, 49 Ala. L. Rev. 51, 54 (1997) (\u201cPrivate litigants do in America much of what is done in other industrial states by public officers working within an adminis\u00adtrative bureaucracy.\u201d).[\/footnote] There is also a long history, extending well into the nineteenth century, of judicially conducted, inquisitorial-style discovery in American courts of equity, a practice that formed the basis for the party-conducted discovery authorized by the Federal Rules.[footnote]See Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition, supra note 92, at 1206. On the rise and fall of equity procedure in the United States during the nineteenth century, see generally Amalia D. Kessler, Inventing American Exceptionalism: The Origins of American Adversarial Legal Culture, 1800\u20131877 (2017).[\/footnote] This all suggests an association between discovery powers and the state\u2014an association that still has some resonance in our civil justice system, if one is to judge from all of the formal markers of state authority that pervade the discovery rules, such as the fact that an \u201cattorney acts as an officer of the court in issuing and signing subpoenas.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1991 amendment.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEven within the contemporary American legal system, state officials and institutions\u2014most notably, police officers[footnote]See Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 694 (\u201cIn many respects the lawyers representing the parties in civil actions have in their hands powers remarkably like those exercised by police investigators in criminal matters.\u201d).[\/footnote] and administrative agen\u00adcies[footnote]See Farhang, supra note 69, at 8 (\u201cThe American civil discovery process effectively confers upon private litigants and their lawyers the same investigatory powers as federal agencies to <em>compel<\/em> sworn testimony and to disgorge documents\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014exercise investigatory powers that are functionally indistin\u00adguishable from the discovery powers exercised by private parties in civil litigation.[footnote]Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1991 amendment (\u201cThe 1948 revision of Rule 45 put the attorney in a position similar to that of the administrative agency, as a public officer entitled to use the court\u2019s contempt power to investigate facts in dispute.\u201d).[\/footnote] The investigatory powers are considered public in those contexts not just because they are wielded by state agents but because they func\u00adtion as necessary adjuncts of an unquestionably public power: the power to enforce the law. Yet, as we have seen, private parties gen\u00aderally exercise the (coercive aspect of the) state\u2019s law-enforcement power in our civil justice system.[footnote]See supra section I.B.1.[\/footnote] Given the close relationship between discovery powers and the power to enforce the law, it makes sense to view the former as a state power too.[footnote]Cf. Carrington, supra note 96, at 54 (\u201c[D]iscovery is the American alternative to the administrative state. We have by means of Rules 26-37, and by their analogues in state law, privatized a great deal of our law enforcement\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Federal Rules themselves implicitly underscore the pub\u00adlic nature of the discovery powers exercised by private parties during civil litigation. In addition to authorizing the parties to compel each other to disclose information, the Rules establish a limited number of mandatory \u201cinitial disclosures\u201d\u2014certain categories of information that the parties must reveal to each other, independent of any request.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a). Even these \u201crequired\u201d disclosures, however, can be waived by the parties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A).[\/footnote] This highlights the fact that the state can choose either to directly compel the disclosure of information itself or to grant that power to private parties. When the state makes the latter choice, as it does for most discovery matters, it seems difficult to describe that as anything other than a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Settlement<\/em>. \u2014 The case for conceptualizing the settlement of an ongoing lawsuit as a delegation of state power seems fairly straightfor\u00adward. With few exceptions, the court plays virtually no role in the settle\u00adment of a civil case; the parties may \u201cgenerally elect to settle disputes and to choose their settlement terms without judicial oversight or inter\u00adference.\u201d[footnote]Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 429; see also Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 698 (\u201c[A]n \u2018active role for the trial court in approving the adequacy of a settlement\u2019 remains today \u2018the exceptional situation, not the general rule.\u2019\u201d (quoting United States v. City of Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1331 (5th Cir. 1980))). The main exception is Rule 23(e), which requires judicial approval of class action settlements. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). Judicial approval is also required for settlements in shareholder derivative actions, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1(c), and settlements reached under certain statutes, such as consent dec\u00adrees in antitrust cases, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a016(b)\u2013(e) (2012).[\/footnote] Yet settlements bind the parties, and it is commonly thought that the power to reach a binding resolution of a private dispute is a paradigmatic state power.[footnote]See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 375 (1971) (recognizing \u201cthe State\u2019s monopoly over techniques for binding conflict resolution\u201d); Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne might think that, in contrast to haling a person into court or compelling her to disclose information, settling a case is too far removed from state-sanctioned coercion to involve the exercise of state power. This impression is bolstered by the default procedure for dismissing a settled lawsuit in federal court. After the parties privately agree to settle the case, the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the action by filing either a notice of dismissal (if before the defendant\u2019s answer or summary judg\u00adment motion) or a stipulation of dismissal signed by all the parties (if later)\u2014but either way, without having to obtain a court order.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A).[\/footnote] Given this procedure, \u201csettlements do not implicate the judiciary\u2019s judgment\u201d as to either liability or remedy.[footnote]Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 430; see also Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 697 (\u201cSettlement\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is a private, largely invisible, contractual phenomenon; the judge plays a role only as a potential facilitator of private agreement.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The overwhelming majority of settlements require only that the parties agree; the court is told only that the plaintiff is dismissing the case.\u201d).[\/footnote] The state in no way lends its imprimatur to the parties\u2019 resolution of the dispute but rather acts as if the lawsuit had never been filed. Formally, then, most settlement agreements look like any other private contract, and unless we are willing to completely jettison the public\u2013private distinction,[footnote]See supra note 47.[\/footnote] merely forming a voluntary agreement does not involve the exercise of a delegated state power.[footnote]Cf. Metzger, supra note 4, at 1444 (\u201c[T]he power to resolve disputes on a <em>nonconsensual<\/em> basis, even subject to later state court review, is one that government cannot delegate to private actors without preserving some opportunity for prior review.\u201d (emphasis added)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the dismissal procedure laid out in the Rules, how\u00adever, courts often issue an order dismissing a settled case and incorporate the parties\u2019 settlement agreement into the order\u2014without necessarily hav\u00ading supervised the negotiation of the agreement or approved its terms.[footnote]One of the primary ways this occurs in federal court is under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America<\/em>, which held that a federal district court may exercise \u201cancillary jurisdiction\u201d over a subsequent action to enforce a settlement agreement, notwithstanding the absence of federal question and diversity jurisdiction, so long as it entered an order dismissing the original, settled action while also \u201cincorporating\u201d or \u201cretaining jurisdiction over\u201d the agreement in its order. 511 U.S. 375, 381\u201382 (1994). For other ways in which courts blur the formal boundary between settlements and court judgments, including through practices such as consent decrees, see Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 628, 630\u201333, 637, 662\u201365.[\/footnote] This practice transmutes the parties\u2019 private resolution of their dispute into a formal court order subject to ongoing coercive enforce\u00adment by the state, while forgoing the judicial scrutiny that typically precedes such an order. In this respect, settlements that are incorporated into a court order are difficult to distinguish from the delegations of state power involved in a summons or party-issued subpoena.\r\n\r\nEven settlements that are not memorialized in a court order gen\u00aderally end up functioning in practice much more like formal judgments than ordinary contracts. A prevailing plaintiff usually enforces a court judgment against a recalcitrant defendant through separate procedures that leave state officials with little discretion to withhold relief.[footnote]In federal district court, the enforcement of money judgments is generally gov\u00aderned by the law of the State in which the court sits. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a). State law typically provides for enforcement through a combination of writ-like procedures and separate enforcement actions. See Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, supra note 51, at 124\u201330. Federal court judgments compelling specific actions are enforced via clerk-issued writs. Fed. R. Civ. P. 70(c)\u2013(d).[\/footnote] A violated settle\u00adment agreement, by contrast, is usually enforced through a separate State law action for breach of contract.[footnote]See J.J. Prescott &amp; Kathryn E. Spier, A Comprehensive Theory of Civil Settlement, 91 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 59, 65 (2016).[\/footnote] So far, court judg\u00adments and settlement agreements seem to inhabit completely different remedial worlds. But the contract law principles that govern the enforcement of settlement agreements can diverge from those that govern the enforcement of ordinary contracts in crucial respects. Compared with ordinary contracts, settlement agreements require an especially \u201cstrong showing\u201d of invalid\u00adity[footnote]15A C.J.S. Compromise &amp; Settlement \u00a7\u00a033 (2017); see also, e.g., Hallock v. State, 474 N.E.2d 1178, 1180\u201381 (N.Y. 1984) (\u201cStipulations of settlement are favored by the courts and not lightly cast aside.\u201d (citing In re Galasso, 320 N.E.2d 618, 618 (N.Y. 1974))).[\/footnote] and are more difficult to rescind.[footnote]See, e.g., Compromise &amp; Settlement, supra note 114, \u00a7\u00a067 (\u201c[A] mistake that would authorize the setting aside of an ordinary contract will not in all cases justify the setting aside of a compromise agreement.\u201d).[\/footnote] Their terms are also construed more liberally.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a034.[\/footnote] And as with a court judgment, a \u201ccourt will not inquire into the merits or validity of the original claim\u201d when enforcing a settlement agreement.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a077.[\/footnote] Some juris\u00addictions even go so far as to formally treat settlement agreements as court judgments, according them the same preclusive effect.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a027.[\/footnote] These and other departures from general contract principles leave courts with significantly less discretion to refuse to coercively enforce settlement agreements, versus ordinary contracts\u2014much as state officials have little discretion to refuse to coercively enforce court judgments. Yet in the case of settlement, it is the parties themselves, not state officials, who have authoritatively resolved their dispute.[footnote]Taking this feature of settlement agreements to its logical extreme, the Supreme Court has offered limited approval of cognovit (or confession of judgment) notes, provisions in loan agreements that require the debtor to prospectively waive her right to notice and a hearing before a court may enter judgment in favor of the creditor upon default. See D.H. Overmyer Co. v. Frick Co., 405 U.S. 174, 187 (1972). Cognovit notes thus go even further than ordinary settlement agreements, forcing the court to enter a formal, binding judgment without any appearance by the debtor and without regard to the merits of the case.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOther kinds of settlement practices grant private parties even more direct control over the state\u2019s coercive power. For example, under Rule 68, a defendant can make an \u201coffer of judgment\u201d to the plaintiff.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 68.[\/footnote] If the plaintiff accepts the offer, \u201c[t]he clerk must then enter judgment\u201d; if the plaintiff refuses and ends up securing a judgment no more favorable than the spurned offer, then she is liable to the defendant for \u201cthe costs incurred after the offer was made.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 68(a), (d).[\/footnote] This constitutes a kind of con\u00adtingent delegation to the defendant: Simply by making a settlement offer during the litigation, a defendant can force the court either to enter a binding judgment (in the event the offer is accepted) or to sanction the plaintiff (in the event the offer is rejected and the plaintiff\u2019s actual award does not exceed the offer). Either way, the defendant is compelling the court to deploy the state\u2019s coercive power without any opportunity for the court to evaluate the basis on which it is being deployed.[footnote]A similar account can be given of stipulations made by the parties during litigation. As scholars have recognized, a stipulation can be understood as a partial settlement, in the sense that it resolves some important aspect of the case but without terminating the litigation. See Prescott &amp; Spier, supra note 113, at 62\u201364. As such, a stipulation can also be understood as a partial delegation, for it limits the grounds on which a court can deploy the coercive power of the state but without fully determining how that power is deployed.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>C. Doubting Delegation<\/h3>\r\nAt various points, the previous section addressed a number of specific objections to conceiving of civil procedure\u2019s prosecution, discovery, and settlement powers as delegated state powers. This section briefly considers two additional, more thoroughgoing objections: (1) that private parties are formally \u201csubordinate\u201d to courts and (2) that \u201cmana\u00adgerial judges\u201d oversee parties\u2019 litigation conduct to such an extent that none of that conduct can constitute a private exercise of delegated state power.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Party Subordinance. \u2014 <\/em>Even assuming that the powers discussed in the previous section are public, one still might question whether the Rules really allow private parties to exercise those powers in ordinary civil litigation\u2014whether, that is, the powers are actually delegated. Scott Dodson\u2019s elaboration of what he calls the \u201cparty subordinance\u201d thesis suggests a particularly potent challenge along these lines. According to that thesis, \u201cparties\u2019 attempts to alter otherwise applicable procedures\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. are wholly unenforceable absent some legal authorization for judicial enforcement. And even when the law allows parties to exercise litigation choices, courts retain largely unfettered discretion\u2014cabined only by law\u2014to disregard or override those choices.\u201d[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 6\u20137; see also Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 562\u201363 (identifying various procedural rules that require courts to override party preferences).[\/footnote] Dodson does not con\u00adsider in any significant detail the specific contexts addressed in the previous section\u2014prosecution, discovery, and settlement[footnote]Dodson\u2019s only significant discussion of discovery, for example, focuses narrowly on Rule 29, which concerns parties\u2019 stipulations regarding discovery procedures. See Dodson, supra note 14, at 22.[\/footnote]\u2014but his account nonetheless suggests that, even in those contexts, we should view courts, rather than litigants, as exercising ultimate control over the state\u2019s coer\u00adcive power.\r\n\r\nDodson\u2019s party-subordinance thesis purports to describe the <em>formal<\/em> rules governing civil litigation,[footnote]See, e.g., id. at 7, 19 (emphasizing parties\u2019 lack of \u201cformal control over litigation\u201d).[\/footnote] but it is difficult to justify this exclu\u00adsively formal focus. Surely what matters is who controls the state\u2019s coer\u00adcive power as a practical matter, not who bears nominal responsibi\u00adlity for its exer\u00adcise.[footnote]Cf. Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 537\u201340 (arguing that delegations can be \u201cplanned\u201d or \u201cde facto\u201d).[\/footnote] And as the previous section showed, the rules governing prosecution, discovery, and settlement functionally \u201cempower[] or allow[] party dominance\u201d while denying courts \u201cdiscretion to override lawful party choices\u201d with respect to the initial exercise of coercive power[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 19.[\/footnote]\u2014in contrast to the impression the party-subordinance thesis might create.\r\n\r\nNor does the existence of even substantial judicial discretion necess\u00adarily preclude a delegation of state power. After all, public law scholars conceptualize the \u201cprivatization\u201d of various governmental programs as a delegation of state power even though administrative agencies must formally authorize private entities to administer the programs and retain discretion to override their decisions, which are also often subject to judi\u00adcial review.[footnote]See, e.g., Metzger, supra note 4, at 1377\u2013400; cf. Nagareda, supra note 18, at 191\u201398 (arguing that Rule 23 delegates lawmaking authority to lawyers in class actions, even though the court must ultimately approve any class settlement).[\/footnote] That is presumably because, notwithstanding the govern\u00adment\u2019s supervisory authority, private parties are still exercising state power in the first instance and thus can potentially cause serious harm before the government has a chance to intervene. Private parties likewise exercise multiple state powers in the first instance during ordinary civil litigation. While we may think that the prospect of judicial intervention serves as an adequate check on any potential abuse of those powers, the risk of abuse still exists. The delegation framework developed in the previous section calls attention to such concerns, whereas a narrow focus on private parties\u2019 formal \u201csubordinance\u201d to courts tends to occlude them.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Managerial Judges<\/em>. \u2014 Another objection is more practical than conceptual. This Part has argued that parties enjoy wide latitude in exercising various coercive powers during civil litigation, often with no meaningful judicial involvement. But many will no doubt dispute this depiction of judges as relatively passive bystanders. According to a popu\u00adlar critique of contemporary federal civil practice, the demise of the civil trial has not diminished the judicial role so much as transformed it. Rather than adjudicate cases, judges now perform a more \u201cmanagerial\u201d function, shepherding cases and litigants through the pretrial phase.[footnote]This critique is most prominently associated with Judith Resnik. See Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2844\u201350; Judith Resnik, Failing Faith: Adjudicatory Procedure in Decline, 53 U. Chi. L. Rev. 494, 496 (1986); Judith Resnik, Managerial Judges, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 374, 374 (1982); Resnik, Privatization, supra note 6, at 1803\u201306; Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 610\u201319; Judith Resnik, Trial as Error, Jurisdiction as Injury: Transforming the Meaning of Article III, 113 Harv.

Gensler, Judicial Case Management: Caught in the Crossfire, 60 Duke L.J. 669, 669 (2010); Miller, Double Play, supra note 90, at 54\u201361, 78\u201381; Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 292\u201393; Jonathan T. Molot, An Old Judicial Role for a New Litigation Era, 113 Yale L.J. 27, 27 (2003); Todd D. Peterson, Restoring Structural Checks on Judicial Power in the Era of Managerial Judging, 29 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 41, 41 (1995). But see Steven Baicker-McKee, Reconceptualizing Managerial Judges, 65 Am. U. L. Rev. 353, 353 (2015) (defending managerial judging).[\/footnote] This judicial management takes a number of different forms, exempli\u00adfied for critics by the (discretionary) Rule 16 pretrial conference, during which the judge can structure the discovery process and pretrial motions practice.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 16. Another source of judges\u2019 management authority is the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0471\u2013482 (2012), which requires federal district courts to develop procedures to combat expense and delay.[\/footnote] While judicial management does not extend to the prose\u00adcution of a case\u2014plaintiffs still decide which claims to press and whom to name as defendants\u2014it has fundamentally reshaped discovery and settle\u00adment; what were once largely private, consensual processes now often unfold under the court\u2019s watchful eye.[footnote]Indeed, one of the main criticisms of \u201cmanagerial judging\u201d is that judges can use their managerial authority to unduly pressure parties to forgo trials and settle their cases. See Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 638\u201345; see also Marc Galanter &amp; Mia Cahill, \u201cMost Cases Settle\u201d: Judicial Promotion and Regulation of Settlements, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 1339, 1342\u201346 (1994) (discussing factors that influence judicial intervention in settlements).[\/footnote] One might think, therefore, that courts retain too much control over the state\u2019s coercive powers during civil litigation for those powers to be delegated to the parties.[footnote]Cf. Robert G. Bone, Who Decides? A Critical Look at Procedural Discretion, 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 1961, 1967\u201371 (2007) [hereinafter Bone, Who Decides?] (describing various forms of discretion judges enjoy under the Federal Rules, though not focusing on the Rules considered in this Part); Stephen N. Subrin &amp; Thomas O. Main, Braking the Rules: Why State Courts Should Not Replicate Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 67 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 501, 508\u201310 (2016) (similar). But see Bone, Who Decides?, supra, at 1995 n.137 (\u201c[M]uch of what happens at the pretrial stage takes place outside the judge\u2019s view[].\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to quarrel with this picture of the \u201cmanagerial judge\u201d as a descriptive matter, but it is important to distinguish two different ideas that often go under the heading \u201cjudicial management,\u201d each of which has different implications for the delegation thesis advanced in the pre\u00advious section. First, there is <em>management as housekeeping<\/em>\u2014administrative measures that help to ensure the orderly progression of the pretrial pro\u00adcess. For discovery, judges can set schedules for making various disclosures and raising various objections.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3); Ratner, supra note 91, at 2153.[\/footnote] As for settlement, because judges gener\u00adally have no say in the content of settlement agreements,[footnote]See supra note 105 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] they are largely relegated to encouraging the parties to settle and facilitating negotiations between them.[footnote]See Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 701. Rule 16 expressly lists \u201cfacilitating settlement\u201d as one of the goals of the pretrial conference. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(a)(5).[\/footnote] None of these forms of judicial involvement significantly curtails the parties\u2019 discretion in exercising coercive powers; the parties can still largely compel whatever discovery, or settle on whatever terms, they would like. At least the \u201chousekeeping\u201d aspect of the \u201cmanagerial judges\u201d thesis, then, is compatible with concep\u00adtualizing the parties\u2019 discov\u00adery and settlement powers as delegations of state power.\r\n\r\nSecond, there is <em>management as supervision<\/em>\u2014judicial scrutiny of, and interference with, the parties\u2019 exercise of power during discovery and settlement. Although judges generally do not set strict limits on the scope of discovery,[footnote]See, e.g., John S. Beckerman, Confronting Civil Discovery\u2019s Fatal Flaws, 84 Minn. L. Rev. 505, 561\u201371 (2000); John L. Carroll, Proportionality in Discovery: A Cautionary Tale, 32 Campbell L. Rev. 455, 463 (2010).[\/footnote] they sometimes do, especially in complex cases.[footnote]See Ratner, supra note 91, at 2153\u201354, 2164. The court\u2019s pretrial order may \u201cmodify the extent of discovery.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3)(B)(ii). Judicial limits on the scope of discovery are by no means uncontroversial; some scholars have argued that such limits undermine the private enforcement of public regulatory regimes. See Carrington, supra note 96, at 60\u201362.[\/footnote] Likewise, judges in some cases go beyond simply encouraging settlement and actively participate in negotiations, even advocating specific settlement terms.[footnote]See Bone, Who Decides?, supra note 132, at 1968 (noting that \u201ca judge can choose from a diverse menu of options\u201d regarding settlement promotion); Bert I. Huang, Trial by Preview, 113 Colum. L. Rev. 1323, 1368 (2013) (\u201c[C]ourts\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. vary as to how much of a role the future trial judge is allowed to play in settlement negotiations before trial.\u201d); Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 699 (\u201cThe civil rules cast the judge in the role\u2014should she wish to assume it\u2014of participant and even persuader, convening the parties and suggesting various possibilities of settlement and creative approaches to bridging disagreements between the parties.\u201d); Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences, supra note 62, at 657 (describing revisions to Rule 16 as \u201cfurther encourag[ing] judges\u201d to \u201cencourag[e] settlement\u201d and noting the debate about the desirability of such a role). See generally Ellen E. Deason, Beyond \u201cManagerial Judges\u201d: Appropriate Roles in Settlement, 78 Ohio St. L.J. 73, 77\u2013104 (2017) (canvassing the different ways in which judges can be involved in settlement).[\/footnote] Again, these practices, while not uncommon, are not the norm; notwithstanding the fact that some judges \u201care vigorously presiding, sometimes as managers, sometimes as judges,\u201d it is still the case that \u201clawyers\u2019 procedural choices will draw only sporadic judicial scrutiny.\u201d[footnote]Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences, supra note 62, at 638, 647; cf. Ratner, supra note 91, at 115 tbl.1 (identifying \u201c[v]ariation among judges and cases\u201d as a significant limit on the effectiveness of managerial judging).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe default in ordinary civil litigation thus remains a regime of party-driven discovery and settlement, with only the prospect of more significant judicial involvement lurking in the background. And even that involve\u00adment does not <em>eliminate<\/em> the delegations described in the previous section. Rather, as the next Part argues, we should understand \u201cmana\u00adgerial judging,\u201d in its more supervisory guises, as a set of strategies for <em>policing<\/em> civil procedure\u2019s delegations when private parties abuse dele\u00adgated state power.\r\n<h2>II. Policing Civil Procedure\u2019s Delegations<\/h2>\r\nThis Part shows that civil procedure, even as it pervasively delegates coercive state power to private parties, also contains numerous doctrines that enable courts to police its delegations for abuse. Public law scholars have long recognized the potential for delegations of state power to be abused and the corresponding need for the state to police them. As section\u00a0II.A argues, civil procedure\u2019s delegations are no less prone to abuse, though the abuse assumes a different form in civil litigation than in the public law contexts on which scholars have primarily focused.\r\n\r\nSection II.B then collects and classifies myriad procedural doctrines that allow courts to police private parties\u2019 exercises of delegated state power during ordinary civil litigation. The doctrines fall into three main categories: those that rescind a delegated power, those that withhold enforcement from an exercise of delegated power, and those that punish abuse of delegated power. Whereas other scholars have tended to treat these various doctrines as unrelated to one another, this Part aims to show that they perform the common function of allowing the state to distance itself from private exercises of delegated power that offend especially important public values.\r\n<h3>A. Abusing Delegated Procedural Powers<\/h3>\r\nRecall the structure of civil procedure\u2019s delegation problem: At vari\u00adous points during ordinary civil litigation, the Federal Rules effectively grant private parties the power to coerce others but without requiring prior judicial approval for those exercises of coercion. That creates a significant risk that the state\u2019s coercive power will be abused\u2014we have learned as much from the extensive literature on the \u201cprivatization\u201d of many of the government\u2019s administrative functions.[footnote]See generally Government by Contract: Outsourcing and American Democracy (Jody Freeman &amp; Martha Minow eds., 2009) (discussing the growth of government and the outsourcing of governmental functions to private entities); Paul R. Verkuil, Outsourcing Sovereignty: Why Privatization of Government Functions Threatens Democracy and What We Can Do About It (2007) (evaluating the role of private contractors in performing governmental functions); Metzger, supra note 4 (analyzing the constitutionality of the \u201cprivatization\u201d of governmental functions); Minow, Public and Private Partnerships, supra note 1 (considering the effects of privatization on public values).[\/footnote] But just as the delegations at issue in public law contexts differ from civil procedure\u2019s delegations in important respects, so we need a different conception of abuse of state power to understand the unique risks posed by the delegations in ordinary civil litigation.\r\n\r\nPublic law\u2019s conception of abuse of delegated state power begins from what Gillian Metzger has called \u201cthe principle of constitutional accounta\u00adbility.\u201d[footnote]Metzger, supra note 4, at 1373.[\/footnote] According to that principle, \u201cthe Constitution imposes limits on the actions that governments can take,\u201d limits that \u201capply to all exercises of government power, whether wielded by officially public or nominally private entities.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Any conception of abuse of delegated state power in civil litigation should start from the same general principle. But public law scholars have cashed out the notion of \u201caccountability\u201d in ways that do not capture the concerns raised by civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtions of state power.\r\n\r\nConsider again Seth Davis\u2019s conception of a delegation as authoriza\u00adtion to act on the government\u2019s behalf.[footnote]See supra notes 68\u201375 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] From that conception, Davis derives a notion of accountability according to which \u201cthe Constitution requires all government action to be justified by reference to some public value.\u201d[footnote]Davis, supra note 18, at 607 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Cass R. Sunstein, Naked Preferences and the Constitution, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 1689, 1692 (1984)); see also id. at 615 (\u201cLiberal democracies demand that government action be based upon public reasons, not raw preferences\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Other scholars take a similar view. See, e.g., Lawrence, supra note 42, at 659 (endorsing the principle that governmental officials should exercise their authority to promote \u201csome conception of what is good for the community\u201d).[\/footnote] A private party, on this view, must affirmatively pursue some public-regarding purpose when exercising delegated state power for the delegation to be legitimate; if she instead employs the power to some pri\u00advate end, she violates constitutional norms and abuses the delegation.[footnote]Cf. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a0387 (Am. Law Inst. 1958) (providing that an agent must \u201cact <em>solely<\/em> for the benefit of the principal in all matters connected with his agency\u201d (emphasis added)); Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08.01\u2013.06 (Am. Law Inst. 2006) (same). This constitutional principle is embodied in the private nondelegation doctrine, which holds that the government violates due process when it delegates its lawmaking power in ways that allow private parties to regulate others\u2019 conduct for private purposes. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311 (1936). Davis draws on the private nondelegation doctrine in developing his state action theory of standing. See Davis, supra note 18, at 610\u201311, 615\u201316.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat conception of accountability (and abuse) makes sense insofar as the government has authorized private parties to act on its behalf. But as we have seen, the government can delegate state power to private parties without necessarily making them its agents or forbidding them to pursue their own interests.[footnote]Metzger appears to concede this point. See Metzger, supra note 4, at 1468\u201369 (acknowledging the possibility that the state can delegate power to private parties without creating an agency relationship).[\/footnote] Sometimes, the government grants private parties power not so they can directly pursue public objectives in its stead but so they can more effectively pursue private ends that society deems valuable.[footnote]To be sure, by using delegated state power to pursue their own ends, private parties can, through an invisible-hand-like mechanism, also further public goals\u2014even in traditional private law cases. Cf. William J. Novak, The Myth of the \u201cWeak\u201d American State, 113 Am. Hist. Rev. 752, 769\u201371 (2008) (identifying delegation as a state-building strategy). See generally Farhang, supra note 69 (examining how the state uses private enforcement to augment its regulatory capacities). But the existence of such incidental effects does not convert private parties into the government\u2019s agents.[\/footnote] These private exercises of power are nevertheless delegations because of the <em>nature<\/em> of the power private parties wield\u2014in the context of civil litigation, the power to coerce others to take actions in relation to the binding resolution of private disputes.[footnote]Perhaps the clearest doctrinal support for this conception of a delegation is the \u201ccivil <em>Batson<\/em>\u201d case. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991). There, the Supreme Court held that peremptory challenges constitute a delegation of state power, see id. at 626\u201328, notwithstanding the fact that litigants may legitimately exercise those challenges for private purposes, see id. at 626 (\u201cThough the motive of a peremptory challenge may be to protect a private interest, the objective of jury selection proceedings is to determine representation on a governmental body.\u201d). For further discussion of <em>Edmonson<\/em> as a delegation-policing strategy, see infra section II.B.2.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis different conception of delegation calls for different concep\u00adtions of accountability and abuse. When a private party is delegated state power but is not required to affirmatively pursue some public purpose, she remains accountable by not offending certain norms governing the exercise of state power in the course of pursuing her private ends. Con\u00adversely, a private party abuses delegated state power when she violates those norms. The worry in civil procedure is not that private parties will fail to further public goals\u2014they generally are not required to do so\u2014but that they will \u201ccommandeer[] the judicial process\u201d and \u201cforce a publicly subsidized court to <em>sacrifice<\/em> public benefits for purely private interests.\u201d[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 15 (emphasis added).[\/footnote] The risk is one of harm to public values rather than neglect of public duties.\r\n\r\nThus articulated, this account of abuse of civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtions remains largely formal rather than substantive. It identifies the normative structure of the abuse as the violation of important public values, without elaborating on the specific content of those values. It is beyond the scope of this Article to provide a comprehensive account of the pub\u00adlic values whose violation constitutes an abuse of delegated state power,[footnote]I plan to develop a more complete account in future work.[\/footnote] but those values have many sources. One is the Federal Rules themselves. The notion that the Rules are value-free[footnote]See, e.g., Miller, Double Play, supra note 90, at 90 (noting the rulemakers\u2019 \u201cdesire to keep the original Federal Rules textually simple and value neutral as much as possible\u201d).[\/footnote] has long since been debunked; as scholars have recognized, the Rules embody a number of important values, including justice, accuracy, transparency, and effi\u00adciency.[footnote]See, e.g., Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 288 (\u201cWhen the Federal Rules were promulgated in 1938, they embodied a justice-seeking ethos.\u201d); Stephen N. Subrin, How Equity Conquered Common Law: The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in Historical Perspective, 135 U. Pa. L. Rev. 909, 943\u201348 (1987) (arguing that the values of \u201cequity lived on through the Federal Rules\u201d).[\/footnote] Beyond the Rules, substantive law reflects other fundamental normative commitments of our society, such as nondiscrimi\u00adnation. These and other values are, to varying degrees, implicated in private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated state power during civil litigation.\r\n\r\nMany procedural rules and doctrines seek to safeguard these values by requiring <em>courts<\/em> to honor them in the course of adjudicating disputes. Thus, courts must follow certain procedures before rendering decisions, judges may not discriminate against parties based on race, court proceed\u00adings must generally be open to the public, and so on. But because private parties also wield state power during civil litigation, they, too, can violate the norms governing the exercise of that power. Hence the need for <em>delegation-policing<\/em> <em>doctrines<\/em>\u2014doctrines that allow the state to specifically address exercises of delegated state power that offend especially impor\u00adtant public values.\r\n<h3>B. Civil Procedure\u2019s Delegation-Policing Doctrines<\/h3>\r\nCivil procedure generally affords private parties wide leeway to exer\u00adcise delegated state power during civil litigation. Rather than hold private parties to the same standards that govern courts and other public institu\u00adtions, civil procedure brooks a significant amount of abuse of delegated state power as one of the costs of having an adversarial, as opposed to inquisitorial, system.[footnote]Cf. Daniel Markovits, Arbitration\u2019s Arbitrage: Social Solidarity at the Nexus of Adjudication and Contract, 59 DePaul L. Rev. 431, 445\u201348 (2010) (noting that litigants and their lawyers may act contrary to various public values).[\/footnote] There comes a point, however, at which civil pro\u00adcedure deems private parties\u2019 abuse of delegated power too egregious to tolerate and allows the state to counteract that abuse in various ways. This section examines multiple doctrines that police the outer limits of private parties\u2019 discretion to wield delegated state power during civil litigation.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, it is useful to distinguish doctrines that incidentally prevent abuse of delegated state power by limiting parties\u2019 opportunities to exercise it. One particularly controversial example is pleading. By tightening the general pleading standard under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules,[footnote]See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\u201379 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562\u201363 (2007).[\/footnote] the Supreme Court attempted to make it more difficult for com\u00adplaints to survive a motion to dismiss, thereby restricting plaintiffs\u2019 access to discovery\u2014and thus their opportunities to abuse their discovery-related powers.[footnote]This Article brackets the empirical debate over whether <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em> have in fact had this effect. For a recent overview of, and contribution to, that debate, see generally Jonah B. Gelbach, Material Facts in the Debate over <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em>, 68 Stan. L. Rev. 369 (2016) (presenting empirical evidence regarding the adjudication of defendant-filed summary judgment motions after <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em>).[\/footnote] A number of subject-matter-specific rules and statutes impose similar limits on how plaintiffs may prosecute certain kinds of claims.[footnote]E.g., Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-67, \u00a7\u00a0104, 109 Stat. 737, 757 (1995) (imposing special procedural requirements for private actions under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934); Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (imposing a heightened pleading requirement for fraud claims). See generally Jessica Erickson, Heightened Procedure, 102 Iowa L. Rev. 61 (2016) (describing heightened procedural requirements for securities class actions, medical malpractice lawsuits, and product liability cases). State anti-SLAPP laws are another example. As exemplified by California\u2019s statute, anti-SLAPP laws apply to lawsuits that implicate the defendant\u2019s free-speech rights, such as libel actions. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7\u00a0425.16(b), (e) (2018). Defendants in such actions may file \u201ca special motion to strike,\u201d which stays discovery and requires the plaintiff to show, based on whatever evidence she already has, that she is more likely than not to prevail on her claim. See id. \u00a7\u00a0425.16(b), (g).[\/footnote] Such doctrines do not directly regulate the <em>grounds<\/em> on which parties may exercise the powers delegated to them during civil litigation but rather seek to reduce the overall costs of litigation by restricting par\u00adties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to those powers. The doctrines nonetheless have the effect of limiting parties\u2019 opportunities to exercise\u2014and thus to abuse\u2014delegated powers. One can therefore understand the doctrines as embodying a kind of prophylactic strategy for reducing the risk of abuse of delegated state power before it has occurred.\r\n\r\nThat kind of strategy has significant shortcomings. Most notably, the state faces considerable decision costs in trying to anticipate and forestall every potential form of abuse of civil procedure\u2019s delegated powers. Any rule that seeks to restrict access to those powers will consequently be overbroad, which can undermine other values, such as access to justice.[footnote]This is a major basis for criticism of <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em>. See, e.g., A. Benjamin Spencer, Pleading and Access to Civil Justice: A Response to <em>Twiqbal<\/em> Apologists, 60 UCLA L. Rev. 1710, 1732\u201333 (2013) (arguing that \u201cplausibility pleading is overinclusive and hope\u00adlessly subjective,\u201d that it restricts litigants\u2019 access to justice, and that it is a misguided attempt to curb discovery abuse).[\/footnote] At the same time, even overbroad rules will let some instances of abuse slip by, putting the state in the untenable position of having to tolerate even egregious forms of abuse.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of such drawbacks, civil procedure does not primar\u00adily rely on this ex ante strategy of limiting access to delegated state power. Rather, it generally affords private parties broad access to its delega\u00adtions[footnote]Cf. Richard Marcus, \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism\u201d in Goals for Civil Litigation, <em>in<\/em> Goals of Civil Justice and Civil Procedure in Contemporary Judicial Systems 123, 123, 134\u201335 (Alan Uzelac ed., 2014) (arguing that American civil procedure is \u201cexceptional\u201d in, among other things, \u201crelaxing burdens on plaintiffs\u201d and permitting \u201cextremely broad discovery\u201d).[\/footnote] and then employs an alternative, ex post strategy whereby the state reviews a party\u2019s exercise of delegated power for its conformity with public values and, if the abuse is too much to bear, interferes with or disavows the private party\u2019s actions, making clear that her abuse of state power cannot stand unchallenged.[footnote]To be clear, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines are enshrined in various rules, statutes, and court decisions before they are applied in any case, and so are in that sense \u201cex ante.\u201d But they are \u201cex post\u201d in the specific sense that courts apply them in response to an abusive exercise of delegated power, whereas access-restricting doctrines, such as pleading rules, attempt to deny private parties the opportunity to exercise delegated power before any abuse has occurred. The ex post policing function resembles the \u201canti-opportunism\u201d or \u201csafety-valve\u201d function that Henry Smith has ascribed to various equitable doctrines. See Henry E. Smith, Equity as Second-Order Law: The Problem of Opportunism 19 (Harvard Pub. Law Working Paper No. 15-13, 2015), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/\r\nabstract=2617413 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); see also Samuel L. Bray, The System of Equitable Remedies, 63 UCLA L. Rev. 530, 578\u201384 (2016) (describing various \u201cequitable constraints\u201d that help to counteract party abuse of equitable remedies).[\/footnote] Civil procedure is replete with doctrines that perform precisely this <em>delegation-policing<\/em> function.[footnote]This Article\u2019s distinction between access-restricting and delegation-policing doc\u00adtrines differs from Joanna Schwartz\u2019s distinction between \u201cgateway\u201d and \u201cpathway\u201d rules in civil procedure. See Joanna C. Schwartz, Gateways and Pathways in Civil Procedure, 60 UCLA L. Rev. 1652, 1654\u201355 (2013). According to Schwartz, \u201c[g]ateway rules limit cost, delay, and unjust outcomes by preventing cases from proceeding to the next stage of litiga\u00adtion, while pathway rules limit cost, delay, and unjust outcomes by controlling troublesome aspects of litigation while allowing cases to proceed.\u201d Id. at 1659. Although most delegation-policing doctrines are pathway rules in this sense, a few terminate the litigation and thus qualify as gateway rules. See, e.g., infra note 179 and accompanying text (discussing sua sponte dismissals). Not all pathway rules, moreover, concern stages of the litigation that involve the exercise of delegated state power. And even among those pathway rules that do, some operate automatically before any abuse has occurred, whereas the delegation-policing doctrines operate through the exercise of judicial discretion after the fact. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) (requiring the parties to make certain \u201cinitial disclosures\u201d \u201cwithout awaiting a discovery request\u201d or court order); Schwartz, supra, at 1659 (classifying Rule 26(a) as a pathway rule). Nor do civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines constitute a form of \u201cad hoc procedure.\u201d Pamela K. Bookman &amp; David L. Noll, Ad Hoc Procedure, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 767, 772\u201373 (2017) (\u201cAd hoc procedure is designed to address a procedural problem that arises in a pending case or litigation. It is then applied retroactively to that pending case or litigation in order to achieve a desired result.\u201d). Although those doctrines operate through the exercise of case-by-case judicial discretion, they are developed before any dispute has arisen rather than during the litigation. See supra note 159.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBefore this section turns to those doctrines, two caveats are in order. First, this Article makes no claim about the origins of civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines. It argues only that various procedural doctrines currently enable courts to police civil procedure\u2019s delegations for abuse, whether or not they were intentionally developed for that purpose.[footnote]Cf. Elena Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 415 (1996) (arguing that various First Amendment doctrines smoke out illicit governmental purposes, regardless of whether they were intentionally devised to perform that function).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, to classify the doctrines considered in this section as dele\u00adgation-policing doctrines is not necessarily to defend them against those who might consider them an inadequate response to the various forms of abuse that can occur during civil litigation. Indeed, civil procedure does not police its delegations consistently but instead tends to address only the most egregious forms of abuse of certain delegations, while ignoring the abuse of other delegations altogether.[footnote]For example, there is no meaningful check on abuse of Rule 68\u2019s offer-of-judgment procedure. See supra notes 120\u2013121 and accompanying text; see also infra notes 299\u2013300 and accompanying text (discussing criticisms of discovery).[\/footnote] That said, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing efforts, however imperfect, address a significant amount of abuse of delegated state power in ordinary civil litigation\u2014especially when compared with the permissiveness of the current arbitra\u00adtion regime.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.1. Civil procedure also responds to significantly more abuse than does public law, which generally ignores \u201cbad faith\u201d conduct by governmental actors. See David E. Pozen, Constitutional Bad Faith, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 885, 918 (2016) (arguing that \u201cjudges have frequently ignored constitutional bad faith\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCivil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines can be classified into three main categories, according to how intrusively they interfere with private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated state power. The following typology is not necessarily comprehensive, nor are the boundaries separating its different categories perfectly clean. The point is to identify the most pro\u00adminent types of delegation-policing strategies in civil procedure.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Rescinding Delegations<\/em>. \u2014 The most intrusive delegation-policing doctrines effectively <em>rescind<\/em> a delegation when it is being abused, and then either reassign responsibility for exercising the delegated state power at issue to a state official or, in extreme cases, deny the private party responsible for the abuse all further access to that power. Among the rescissory doctrines that substitute a state official for the parties are some of the practices that civil procedure scholars have dubbed \u201cmana\u00adgerial judging.\u201d[footnote]See supra section I.C.2.[\/footnote] For example, the Federal Rules permit courts to limit the scope of discovery beyond Rule 26\u2019s capacious relevance standard.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3)(B)(iii); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).[\/footnote] A court can, of course, exercise this discretion for many different rea\u00adsons, including simply to save time and expense. But at least when a court limits discovery in response to the parties\u2019 abusive discovery practices, one can understand the court\u2019s action as (partially) rescinding the parties\u2019 power to decide what discovery to compel and lodging that power back with a state official\u2014namely, the judge.[footnote]The rescission is only partial because the parties still retain broad discretion to compel discovery within the limits set by the court.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe effect is similar when a court appoints a special master to oversee discovery.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53 (authorizing the court to appoint a special master without the parties\u2019 consent when there is \u201csome exceptional condition\u201d); Acad. of Court-Appointed Masters, Appointing Special Masters and Other Judicial Adjuncts: A Handbook for Judges and Lawyers \u00a7\u00a02.1, at 17\u201318 (2d ed. 2009) (identifying as one \u201cexceptional condition\u201d warranting appointment of a master the fact that \u201c[t]here will be unusual discovery or evidentiary problems requiring continued oversight\u201d).[\/footnote] Such oversight can be quite extensive, including supervising depositions,[footnote]See Acad. of Court-Appointed Masters, supra note 167, \u00a7\u00a01.2, at 4 (\u201cSometimes a discovery master will sit in on depositions that are particularly contentious.\u201d).[\/footnote] during which the Rules otherwise give the par\u00adties free rein. While courts will often appoint a discovery master for rea\u00adsons of efficiency, such as handling complex technical issues involved in electronic discovery,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a01.3, at 4.[\/footnote] they sometimes also use special masters to curb discovery abuse. In such cases, the court rescinds some of the coercive discovery powers delegated by the Rules, transferring the parties\u2019 discre\u00adtion for exercising those powers to a state official.[footnote]Although a private individual can be appointed as a special master, she is still a state official in the sense that she\u2019s appointed by and accountable to the court. But see Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition, supra note 92, at 1238\u201360 (arguing that, in many cases, special masters are vulnerable to capture by the parties and thus not truly independent).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCourts can also effectively retract the parties\u2019 power to reach a bind\u00ading resolution of their dispute through a settlement agreement. Recall that judges generally have no say over settlements; with few exceptions, the parties can settle their dispute on whatever terms they\u2019d like without the court\u2019s approval.[footnote]See supra note 105 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] In practice, however, some judges go beyond merely encouraging settlement and facilitating negotiations and shape the actual substance of a settlement agreement.[footnote]See supra note 138 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Although the parties formally retain control (it is the parties, after all, who decide whether to stipulate to a dismissal), in some cases the court can exert such influence that it assumes a kind of adjudicatory authority as a practical matter. Inso\u00adfar as the court exercises that de facto authority to resist what it regards as unfair or otherwise abusive settlement terms, it partially rescinds the parties\u2019 power to authoritatively resolve their dispute themselves.[footnote]To the extent class action settlements involve a delegation of state power, see Nagareda, supra note 18, at 191\u201398, courts can similarly rescind that delegation by aggressively exercising their authority under Rule 23(e) to review and approve such settlements. But see, e.g., William B. Rubenstein, The Fairness Hearing: Adversarial and Regulatory Approaches, 53 UCLA L. Rev. 1435, 1443\u201346 (2006) (arguing that judges exercise insufficient oversight of class action settlements). For critical accounts of the role judges play in policing non-class \u201caggregate settlements,\u201d see generally Howard M. Erichson, The Role of the Judge in Non-Class Settlements, 90 Wash. U. L. Rev. 1015 (2013); David M. Jaros &amp; Adam S. Zimmerman, Judging Aggregate Settlement, 94 Wash. U. L. Rev. 545 (2017). But see Andrew Bradt &amp; D. Theodore Rave, The Information-Forcing Role of the Judge in Multidistrict Litigation, 105 Calif. L. Rev. 1259, 1259 (2017) (urging judges to perform an \u201cinformation-forcing\u201d function in non-class aggregate settlements); Linda S. Mullenix, Policing MDL Non-Class Settlements: Empowering Judges Through the All Writs Act 1\u20132 (Pub. Law &amp; Legal Theory Research Paper Series, Paper No. 572, 2017), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2898980 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (defending judicial involvement in non-class aggregate settlements under the All Writs Act).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMany civil procedure scholars\u2014including many of the proponents of the delegation critique\u2014<em>criticize<\/em> this kind of judicial involvement in settlement negotiations for, among other things, potentially pressuring weaker parties to relinquish their right to their day in court.[footnote]See supra note 131; see also Bone, Who Decides?, supra note 132, at 2012\u201314 (identifying other potential problems with judicial involvement in settlement negotiations).[\/footnote] That is a legitimate concern, but viewing such involvement as a delegation-policing strategy shows it to be much less pernicious, and even salutary. Given that most parties are going to settle with or without the court\u2019s approval, we should welcome judicial involvement in ordinary settle\u00adments as a way for the state to reassert control over its coercive adjudica\u00adtory power when that power stands to be abused by the private parties to whom it has been delegated.\r\n\r\nBeyond these transsubstantive delegation-rescinding strategies, vari\u00adous subject-matter-specific procedural rules can similarly be understood as ways of reasserting state control over delegated powers, particularly the prosecutorial power, in cases of abuse. Consider the provision of the False Claims Act (FCA) that allows the federal government to intervene in and take over the prosecution of a qui tam action.[footnote]See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03730(b) (2012).[\/footnote] At first glance, that provision seems to simply reflect the fact that, in a qui tam action, the federal government is the real party in interest, while the private relator is a mere stand-in seeking to vindicate the government\u2019s interests. Given this structure, the FCA\u2019s intervention provision appears to allow the government to prosecute fraud directly in cases in which private enforcement proves inadequate. And that is indeed the provision\u2019s pri\u00admary purpose, but not its sole one. The FCA makes clear that the govern\u00adment does not automatically displace the relator when it intervenes; the relator retains a (minimal) stake even after the government has inter\u00advened and taken over the action.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(1) (providing that the relator generally \u201cshall have the right to continue as a party to the action\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(2)(A) (providing that a qui tam action cannot be dismissed at the government\u2019s behest without first giving the relator an opportunity to be heard); id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(2)(B) (imposing a similar hearing requirement for settlements); id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(3) (permitting the relator to proceed with the action even if the government declines to do so).[\/footnote] The statute further recognizes that the relator\u2019s stake includes a degree of prosecutorial control over the action and that the relator can abuse that control by exercising it for improper purposes. Most notably, the statute authorizes the court to limit, at the government\u2019s request, the relator\u2019s participation in the action in various ways\u2014not just to avoid unnecessary expense and pro\u00admote effi\u00adciency but also when the relator is acting for \u201cpurposes of harassment.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(2)(C)\u2013r(D).[\/footnote] This suggests another (if secondary) purpose served by government intervention in qui tam actions: reclaiming the delegated prosecutorial power for state officials in cases of abuse.[footnote]For empirical evidence regarding Department of Justice (DOJ) intervention practices that is potentially consistent with this hypothesis, see generally David Freeman Engstrom, Public Regulation of Private Enforcement: Empirical Analysis of DOJ Oversight of Qui Tam Litigation Under the False Claims Act, 107 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1689 (2013). Engstrom identifies the FCA\u2019s intervention provision as an agency litigation gatekeeping strategy that is \u201caffirmative,\u201d \u201cbinding,\u201d and \u201cretail,\u201d with \u201cactive displacement\u201d and \u201cstrong control rights.\u201d Engstrom, Litigation Gatekeepers, supra note 48, at 646 tbl.2. For other variations on this policing strategy, see id. at 650\u201354.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEach of the foregoing delegation-policing strategies rescinds the delegated power at issue and substitutes a state official for the private party who abused that power. But the state can also rescind a delegation without substitution, terminating the party\u2019s action rather than allowing the action to continue under government supervision. For example, federal courts may dismiss a complaint sua sponte, without waiting for the defendant to appear and file a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12\u2014though only when the claims are patently frivo\u00adlous and only after affording the plaintiff certain procedural protections, such as notice, an opportunity to be heard, and leave to amend her complaint.[footnote]See 5B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a01357, at 409 &amp; n.4 (3d ed. 2004).[\/footnote] A sua sponte dismissal effectively rescinds the delegated power to coercively hale others into court, thereby preempting a plain\u00adtiff\u2019s (perceived) abuse of that power before she has managed to inflict any serious harm.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, but more controversially, the Prison Litigation Reform Act authorizes federal courts to dismiss sua sponte an action brought by a prisoner challenging prison conditions if the action, among other things, \u201cis frivolous, malicious, [or] fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d[footnote]42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01997e(c)(1) (2012); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01915A(b)(1) (2012).[\/footnote] What is more, under the so-called three-strikes rule, a prisoner generally may not be granted in forma pauperis status if, on three or more prior occasions, he filed an action or appeal that was dis\u00admissed on any of those grounds.[footnote]28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01915(g).[\/footnote] Given the limited financial resources of most prisoners, that is typically tantamount to <em>permanently<\/em> revoking a prisoner\u2019s power to prosecute claims in federal court. One need not countenance the application of this rule to prisoner litigation in parti\u00adcular in order to recognize it as an example of a more general strategy that, along with other rescissory doctrines, allows the state to respond to ongoing abuse of delegated procedural powers.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Withholding Enforcement<\/em>. \u2014 Of course, rescinding a delegated state power works as a delegation-policing strategy only insofar as a private party\u2019s abuse of that power is not yet complete. It does little good to rescind the summonsing power after the plaintiff has haled the defendant into court, or the subpoena power after a party has issued a subpoena, or the settlement power after the parties have stipulated to a dismissal. In each of those cases, one private party has already exercised the state\u2019s coercive power over another. So rather than seek to <em>undo<\/em> that exercise of coercion (which is impossible), the state must try to <em>limit<\/em> its effects. A number of doctrines aim to do exactly that by allowing the state to avoid facilitating, or giving further effect to, an abusive exercise of delegated power.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, this strategy does not figure prominently in the prosecution context. Because a summons issues automatically once the plaintiff presents it to the court clerk,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(b).[\/footnote] the state cannot refuse to enforce the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of the summonsing power; it has little opportunity to spare the defendant from having to appear and answer the complaint, on pain of default. The best the state can do in most cases is to dismiss the complaint after the defendant has appeared and thereby deny the plaintiff access to additional state powers, particularly those relating to discovery.[footnote]It can also punish the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of the prosecutorial power with sanctions, a strategy considered below. See infra section II.B.3.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe state can, by contrast, more effectively avoid facilitating a party\u2019s abuse of the various discovery powers. If a party makes an abusive discov\u00adery request and, after the other party refuses, moves to compel,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a).[\/footnote] the court cannot undo the coercion the moving party has already exercised. It can, however, limit the effects of that coercion by denying the motion to compel. The opposing party still must affirmatively resist the request and oppose the motion (or preemptively move for a protective order before the motion has been filed), but at least she won\u2019t have to actually turn over the requested information. The same is true when a court grants a motion to quash a subpoena.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3).[\/footnote] By refusing in each case to lend the state\u2019s support to a party\u2019s abusive exercise of delegated coercive power during discovery, the court avoids compounding the abuse.[footnote]Similarly, even as it delegates the state\u2019s power to reach binding resolutions of private disputes, see supra note 111, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375 (1994), at least theoretically gives federal courts a kind of de facto review power over settlement agreements that they would otherwise lack. For if the parties are not completely diverse and want their agreement to be enforceable in federal court, they will have to persuade the court either to retain jurisdiction over the agreement or to incorporate it into the order dismissing the case. That effectively empowers the court to condition federal jurisdiction over a future enforcement action on a fair agreement and, conversely, to refuse to lend support to an agreement it deems unfair by refusing jurisdiction. Although proponents of the delegation critique of arbitration have been somewhat wary of <em>Kokkonen<\/em>, see, e.g., Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 627, the case creates space for a delegation-policing strategy in an area where parties otherwise enjoy nearly unfettered discretion.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile one finds examples of this delegation-policing strategy at the core of the Federal Rules, it is even more prominent in other parts of the procedure canon. Perhaps the clearest example is <em>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.<\/em>, in which the Supreme Court extended the constitutional ban on race-based peremptory challenges in the selection of criminal juries to civil cases[footnote]500 U.S. 614, 618\u201328 (1991).[\/footnote]\u2014so-called civil <em>Batson<\/em>.[footnote]Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986) (establishing a constitutional ban on race-based peremptory challenges in criminal cases).[\/footnote] Because the constitutional guarantee of equal protection applies only to \u201cstate action,\u201d[footnote]<em>Edmonson<\/em>, 500 U.S. at 619.[\/footnote] the key issue in <em>Edmonson<\/em> was whether a private litigant (or her lawyer) could be considered a state actor in exercising peremptory challenges against prospective jurors. The Court applied a two-pronged test to resolve that question and found the first prong\u2014whether a peremptory challenge is \u201ca right or privilege having its source in state authority\u201d[footnote]Id. at 620.[\/footnote]\u2014to be easily met, given that peremptory challenges are available only insofar as the government chooses to authorize them.[footnote]See id. at 620\u201321.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs for the second prong\u2014\u201cwhether a private litigant in all fairness must be deemed a government actor in the use of peremptory chal\u00adlenges\u201d\u2014the Court considered the extent to which the peremptory challenge is imbued with public authority.[footnote]Id. at 621.[\/footnote] Peremptory challenges, the Court noted, depend on \u201cthe overt, significant participation of the government,\u201d from the government\u2019s general administration of the jury system to the court\u2019s involvement in voir dire.[footnote]Id. at 622\u201324.[\/footnote] But more relevant for this Article\u2019s argument, the Court also emphasized that litigants exercise peremptory challenges in the course of discharging \u201ca traditional func\u00adtion of the government\u201d: selecting the members of the jury, a govern\u00admental body.[footnote]Id. at 624.[\/footnote] The peremptory challenge, in other words, is one aspect of a \u201cdelegated\u201d state power.[footnote]See id. at 626\u201328.[\/footnote] And the Court clearly saw litigants as abusing that delegation when they exercise peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.\r\n\r\nThe Court\u2019s refusal to enforce race-based peremptory challenges can accordingly be seen as a delegation-policing strategy akin to the strategy available to courts under the discovery rules. Like a discovery request, a peremptory challenge ultimately depends on court enforce\u00adment to be fully effective.[footnote]See id. at 624 (noting that \u201c[w]ithout the direct and indispensable participation of the judge, who beyond all question is a state actor, the peremptory challenge system would serve no purpose\u201d).[\/footnote] As the Court put it in <em>Edmonson<\/em>, in exercising a peremp\u00adtory challenge, a litigant \u201cinvokes the formal authority of the court, which must discharge the prospective juror.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] <em>Edmonson<\/em> retained the baseline rule that courts will automatically dis\u00adcharge a prospective juror in response to a peremptory challenge, thus preserving the delegation of state power involved in such challenges. But the decision also created room for courts to withhold the state\u2019s support from abusive exercises of that delegated power by refusing to discharge a prospective juror in response to a race-based peremptory challenge. Although the state cannot undo the harm inherent in a discriminatory peremptory challenge, it can avoid facilitating that discrimination and thereby limit the extent of a party\u2019s abuse of delegated state power.\r\n\r\nA similar delegation-policing strategy emerges from a series of Supreme Court decisions over the latter third of the twentieth century concerning the constitutionality of State prejudgment attachment and replevin statutes. In those decisions, the Court repeatedly invalidated laws that allowed a creditor\u2013plaintiff to invoke state assistance in seizing property possessed by the debtor\u2013defendant based on the plaintiff\u2019s conclusory assertion of an interest in the property.[footnote]See Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 18 (1991) (invalidating a Connecticut statute that allowed a plaintiff to attach real estate owned by the defendant during a pending lawsuit simply upon filing a statement of \u201cprobable cause\u201d and posting a bond, without first affording the defendant notice or an opportunity to be heard); N. Ga. Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 606\u201307 (1975) (invalidating a Georgia statute that allowed a plaintiff to garnish the defendant\u2019s assets during a pending lawsuit simply upon filing a conclusory affidavit and posting a bond, without first affording the defendant an opportunity to be heard); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 96 (1972) (invalidating Florida and Pennsylvania summary replevin statutes that allowed any private party to seize personal property that she alleged to be wrongfully held by the possessor simply upon the posting of a bond, without first affording the possessor any notice or an opportunity to be heard); Sniadach v. Family Fin. Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337, 341\u201342 (1969) (invalidating a Wisconsin garnishment statute that allowed a creditor to temporarily freeze the wages of the debtor pending the outcome of the garnishment action simply by serving the summons, without first affording the debtor any notice or an opportunity to be heard).[\/footnote] Although the formal legal question in each case was whether the lack of an adversarial predeprivation hearing violated procedural due process,[footnote]See <em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 9; <em>Di-Chem<\/em>, 419 U.S. at 603; <em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 80; <em>Sniadach<\/em>, 395 U.S. at 338.[\/footnote] the Court could not straightforwardly apply its standard due process analysis, since the government had not initiated the seizure. The Court instead had to consider the permissibility of \u201cenabling an individual to enlist the aid of the State to deprive another of his or her property by means of the prejudgment attachment or similar procedure.\u201d[footnote]<em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 9.[\/footnote] This was essentially a question of the propriety of delegating state power.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, each of the statutes invalidated by the Court resembled the delegations considered in Part I, in that a private party could get the state to deploy its coercive power for her own purposes more or less on her own say-so and without meaningful judicial review. As the Court explained in one of the decisions, \u201c[t]he statutes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. abdicate effective state control over state power. Private parties, serving their own private advantage, may unilaterally invoke state power to replevy goods from another.\u201d[footnote]<em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 93.[\/footnote] This structure mirrors that of the delegations involved in a summons or discovery subpoena.[footnote]To be sure, the Court later made clear that a statute does not delegate state power simply by licensing self-help. See Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 157 (1978) (noting that the \u201ctotal absence of overt official involvement plainly distinguishes this case from earlier decisions imposing procedural restrictions on creditors\u2019 remedies\u201d); cf. Andrew S. Gold, Private Rights and Private Wrongs, 115 Mich. L. Rev. 1071, 1074\u201380 (2017) (arguing that the law sometimes allows self-help, and in such cases, the person engaging in self-help is enforcing her own rights, not exercising state power). But a subsequent decision held that there is a delegation of state power \u201cwhenever officers of the State act jointly with a creditor in securing the property in dispute,\u201d which is the case \u201cwhen the State has created a system whereby state officials will attach property on the ex parte application of one party to a private dispute.\u201d Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 932\u201333, 942 (1982) (construing the phrase \u201cunder color of state law\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 but treating that issue as more or less synonymous with the constitutional state action inquiry); cf. Zo\u00eb Sinel, De-Ciphering Self-Help, 67 U. Toronto L.J. 31, 58 n.70 (2017) (arguing that \u201creplevin is not self-help\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn all but one of the cases in which the Court found a delegation of state power, it deemed the delegation impermissible and invalidated the statute at issue because the State had failed to maintain adequate control over its coercive power.[footnote]See, e.g., <em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 91\u201394.[\/footnote] Those decisions can thus be understood as <em>prohibiting<\/em> delegations of state power when there were insufficient checks on how private parties exercised that power.\r\n\r\nThe Court instead pursued a delegation-<em>policing<\/em> strategy in the one decision in which it both found state action under a repossession statute and upheld the statute as consistent with due process. In <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co.<\/em>, the Court sustained a Louisiana statute that allowed a creditor, on ex parte application to a judge, to provisionally sequester personal property held by the debtor subject to a vendor\u2019s lien.[footnote]416 U.S. 600, 618\u201319 (1974).[\/footnote] The Court distinguished its prior decisions invalidating similar statutes on multiple grounds but emphasized in particular that the predeprivation hearing, though ex parte, was before a judge rather than a court clerk or other ministerial official, and that the creditor had to submit a sworn affidavit setting out the specific factual allegations entitling her to possession of the property.[footnote]See id. at 607\u201310, 616\u201317; see also N. Ga. Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, 419 U.S. 601, 607 (1975) (distinguishing a Georgia garnishment statute from the statute at issue in <em>Mitchell<\/em> on the ground that it required only a conclusory affidavit to be filed with the clerk). The Court also noted that the questions to be resolved by the judge concerned \u201cuncomplicated matters that lend themselves to documentary proof.\u201d <em>Mitchell<\/em>, 416 U.S. at 609.[\/footnote] Notwithstanding these differences, it still makes sense to view the Louisiana statute as delegating state power. After all, the predep\u00adrivation judicial review provided by the statute, while perhaps more than \u201ca mere ministerial act,\u201d[footnote]<em>Mitchell<\/em>, 416 U.S. at 616 n.12.[\/footnote] did not amount to that much more. \u201cSince the procedure\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is completely <em>ex parte<\/em>,\u201d Justice Stewart explained in dissent, the judge \u201ccan do little more than determine the formal suffi\u00adciency of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations before ordering the state agents to take the goods from the defendant\u2019s possession.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 629, 632 (Stewart, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] The provision for judicial review thus did not eliminate the delegation conferred by the other parts of the statute; the baseline remained virtually automatic enforcement of a creditor\u2019s sequestration request. And yet, the statute did allow the state to police that delegation to some degree, by refusing to lend its support to patently abusive sequestration requests. That limited opportunity for the state to withhold enforcement may well have been insufficient to address all or even most abuse, but it is nevertheless an example of a kind of delegation-policing strategy employed in other parts of civil procedure.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Punishing Abuse<\/em>. \u2014 Besides rescinding a delegation of state power when it is being abused or withholding enforcement to limit the effects of the abuse, the state can punish the private party who commits the abuse with various sanctions after the fact. This delegation-policing strategy tends to be less intrusive than the first two, as it does not attempt to actually interfere with private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated state power; parties can still exercise the delegated power as they will, though they must suffer the consequences for any abuse they perpetrate. Nor, of course, can sanctions undo the abuse.[footnote]In very rare circumstances, civil procedure allows courts to undo an abusive exercise of delegated state power. For example, when a party obtains a final judgment in her favor by fraud or other misconduct, the court may annul the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3).[\/footnote] Yet they do allow the state to dis\u00adavow an abusive exercise of delegated state power by expressing condem\u00adnation of the private party\u2019s conduct.\r\n\r\nThe paradigmatic example of this delegation-policing strategy is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules. Rule 11 authorizes courts to impose sanc\u00adtions on a party or her lawyer for, among other things, \u201cpresenting\u201d a written submission \u201cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unneces\u00adsary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1).[\/footnote] To be sure, \u201cpresenting\u201d written submissions to the court encompasses a broad swath of litigation conduct, including routine adversarial actions that in no way involve an exercise of delegated state power. A party does not, for instance, exercise delegated state power by filing a motion for a prelimi\u00adnary injunction or for summary judgment. Filing a written submission does, however, frequently involve an exercise of delegated state power\u2014most notably, when a plaintiff files a complaint and thereby triggers the issuance of a summons.\r\n\r\nIn punishing parties for taking such actions for an \u201cimproper purpose,\u201d Rule 11 reflects the conception of abuse of delegated state power developed in the previous section. Rule 11, like the rest of civil procedure, grants private parties significant latitude to use delegated state power to pursue private ends; a private purpose is not necessarily an \u201cimproper purpose,\u201d and so does not necessarily render an exercise of delegated state power abusive. At the same time, however, private parties must observe certain public norms in wielding state power, and Rule 11 imposes liability for offending those norms. This allows the state to repu\u00addiate, if not reverse, private parties\u2019 abusive exercises of delegated state power.[footnote]Among the sanctions a court may impose under Rule 11 are nonmonetary sanc\u00adtions and monetary penalties payable either to the court or to the other party. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4). When a court imposes a nonmonetary remedy or a penalty payable to the court, the sanction is purely punitive; when it imposes a penalty payable to the other party (such as an award of costs or attorney\u2019s fees), the sanction is also compensatory.[\/footnote] Especially when it\u2019s too late to rescind the delegation or with\u00adhold enforcement, punishing abuse may be the only practical way for the state to maintain a degree of accountability for the procedural powers it has delegated to private parties.[footnote]Scholars have criticized Rule 11 on various grounds over the decades. Among other criticisms, they have faulted courts for imposing sanctions inconsistently across different categories of parties and have worried that the risk of sanctions deters potential plaintiffs from bringing meritorious lawsuits. See Stephen B. Burbank, The Transformation of American Civil Procedure: The Example of Rule 11, 137 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1925, 1937 (1989); Melissa L. Nelken, Sanctions Under Amended Federal Rule 11\u2014Some \u201cChilling\u201d Problems in the Struggle Between Compensation and Punishment, 74 Geo. L.J. 1313, 1339\u201343 (1986); William W. Schwarzer, Rule 11 Revisited, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 1013, 1015\u201317 (1988). Rule 11 was significantly revised in 1993, largely to address these kinds of concerns. See Carl Tobias, The 1993 Revision of Federal Rule 11, 70 Ind. L.J. 171, 171 (1995). Interestingly, the normative valence of Rule 11 seems to have shifted in recent years, as some scholars now invoke Rule 11 as a preferable alternative to other measures aimed at curbing abusive litigation practices, such as heightened pleading standards. See Spencer, supra note 157, at 1722, 1732\u201333.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCivil procedure employs similarly punitive delegation-policing strat\u00adegies throughout civil litigation. While Rule 11 expressly does not apply to discovery,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(d).[\/footnote] Rule 26 authorizes courts to sanction a party for any discovery request that is \u201cinterposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of liti\u00adgation.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(1)(B)(ii), (3). Rule 45 likewise allows courts to sanction a party for issuing and serving a subpoena that \u201cimpos[es] undue burden or expense.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(1).[\/footnote] And pursuant to their inherent powers, federal courts may order a party to pay the other side\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction for \u201cbad-faith\u201d litigation conduct.[footnote]See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 50 (1991).[\/footnote] At least where these sanctions are imposed in connection with an exercise of delegated state power, they constitute an important delegation-policing strategy.\r\n\r\nThe state can sanction abusive exercises of delegated state power not only during the litigation but also through collateral proceedings. Fore\u00admost among the collateral mechanisms are the tort law causes of action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. Like Rule 11, these torts embody the notion of abuse developed in the previous section, in that each imposes tort liability for litigation conduct taken for some \u201cimpro\u00adper purpose\u201d or with \u201cmalice\u201d\u2014instituting a lawsuit in the case of mali\u00adcious prosecution and, depending on the jurisdiction, a wide range of other procedural actions in the case of abuse of process.[footnote]See 3 Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden &amp; Ellen M. Bublick, The Law of Torts \u00a7\u00a0592, at 407\u201315 (2d ed. 2011); id. \u00a7\u00a0594, at 418\u201328.[\/footnote] The action\u00adable abuse, once again, consists in transgressing certain public values in the course of exercising delegated state power rather than merely using such power to pursue some private objective. While it is relatively difficult to prevail on these causes of action,[footnote]For example, in addition to having to prove that the abusive lawsuit was instituted for an improper purpose, a malicious-prosecution plaintiff must prove that the suit was not supported by probable cause and was terminated in her favor. See id. \u00a7\u00a0592, at 407\u201308. A substantial minority of jurisdictions also require malicious-prosecution plaintiffs to show that they suffered some kind of \u201cspecial injury\u201d from the abusive lawsuit. See id. \u00a7\u00a0593, at 415\u201318.[\/footnote] they attach at least some negative consequences to abusive exercises of delegated state power, especially when sanctions during the litigation are unavailable or prove insufficient.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, actions for malicious prosecution or abuse of process are instituted by other private parties, not state officials. So insofar as they con\u00adstitute a punitive delegation-policing strategy, that strategy is only indirect; the delegation-policing function is itself delegated to private parties. This shows that, in contrast to Rule 11 sanctions, the malicious-prosecution and abuse-of-process torts are primarily compensatory and only secondarily puni\u00adtive. Nevertheless, in affording victims of abusive exercises of dele\u00adgated state power some kind of remedy, the state imposes limits on civil procedure\u2019s various delegations.\r\n\r\nFinally, courts can sanction lawyers as well as the parties they rep\u00adresent, both during the litigation and through collateral proceedings. During the litigation, Rule 11 and Rule 26 authorize a court to sanction a party\u2019s lawyer instead of, or in addition to, the party herself.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1), 26(g)(1)(3).[\/footnote] Other provisions are directed exclusively at lawyers, such as a federal statute allowing courts to hold a lawyer partially liable for the opposing side\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs when she \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d[footnote]28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01927 (2012).[\/footnote] Such conduct often involves abusing some of the delegated state powers involved in ordinary civil litigation.[footnote]See, e.g., Apex Oil Co. v. Belcher Co. of N.Y., 855 F.2d 1009, 1019\u201320 (2d Cir. 1988) (holding that \u00a7\u00a01927 applies to discovery abuse).[\/footnote] As for collateral mechanisms, a number of professional ethics rules cover lawyer conduct that can constitute an abuse of delegated state power.[footnote]See, e.g., Model Rules of Prof\u2019l Conduct rs. 1.2(d), 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5(d) (Am. Bar Ass\u2019n 2016).[\/footnote] One of the subsidiary functions of the system of lawyer discipline, it turns out, is policing some of civil procedure\u2019s delegations on behalf of the state. Sanctioning lawyers in all of these various ways makes perfect sense as a delegation-policing strategy insofar as a party has subdelegated a dele\u00adgated state power to her lawyer and the lawyer is at least partially responsible for abusing that power. As with sanctions directed at the par\u00adties, the point is to target the individual who actually abused delegated state power so that the state can distance itself from her misconduct.\r\n<h2>III. Delegation Policing as Complicity Avoidance<\/h2>\r\nConsidering civil procedure\u2019s various delegation-policing doctrines raises the question <em>why<\/em> the state should police the delegated powers in ordinary civil litigation for abuse. At first blush, the answer seems obvious: Especially because state power is coercive power, abuse of delegated state power can cause significant harm to others; the various delegation-policing strategies help to ameliorate, if not prevent, that harm.[footnote]Cf. Davis, supra note 18, at 615\u201321 (arguing that abuse of the delegated power to enforce the law on the government\u2019s behalf can harm third parties in various ways); Metzger, supra note 4, at 1462\u201363 (arguing that abuse of the delegated power to administer govern\u00admental programs on the government\u2019s behalf can unfairly deprive third parties of access to government benefits).[\/footnote] This concern is surely an important part of the story. Indeed, it helps to explain why, from a delegation-policing perspective, many of the doctrines discussed in the previous Part are overbroad, in that they regu\u00adlate not just exercises of delegated state power but adversarial litigation conduct more generally. Those doctrines reflect a generic concern with the harms that can be inflicted through civil litigation, whether by abuse of delegated state power or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSome of the other doctrines, however, have a narrower focus, uniquely targeting exercises of delegated state power, and then only certain kinds of abuse of that power. This Part identifies an additional reason, beyond general harm prevention, for the state to focus on some forms of procedural abuse to the exclusion of others. It argues that the various delegation-policing doctrines reflect not only an other-regarding concern with limiting the harm private parties can suffer from the abuse of delegated state power, but also a self-regarding concern on the part of the state with distancing itself from private wrongdoing that involves the violation of certain public values, so as to preserve its own moral integrity and that of the political community it serves. This Article labels the latter concern \u201ccomplicity avoidance.\u201d[footnote]This concern differs from more familiar anxieties about procedural private ordering\u2019s effects on judicial \u201cintegrity\u201d or \u201clegitimacy\u201d\u2014the worry that private parties\u2019 preferences will displace judges\u2019 independent judgment. See Bone, Party Rulemaking, supra note 38, at 1384\u201397; Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 547\u201351; Dodge, supra note 10, at 764\u201370; cf. Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 419\u201325 (criticizing certain kinds of remedial clauses in contracts on similar grounds).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs with this Article\u2019s account of abuse of delegated state power,[footnote]See supra section II.A.[\/footnote] its account of complicity avoidance is primarily formal rather than substan\u00adtive. This Part seeks to elucidate the general normative structure of the state\u2019s role in facilitating private wrongdoing during civil litigation, not to comprehensively catalog the types of private wrongdoing that threaten to implicate the state and the political community or to specify all the circumstances in which the state has an obligation to extricate itself from those misdeeds.\r\n\r\nSection III.A introduces the concept of complicity avoidance, reveal\u00ading its logic to be immanent in certain corners of civil procedure doctrine, particularly civil <em>Batson<\/em>. Section III.B then shows that state complicity in private wrongdoing is a problem that recurs throughout the law. It considers, in particular, two instances of complicity avoidance beyond civil procedure: the version of the state action doctrine applied in <em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em> and Seana Shiffrin\u2019s revisionist account of the unconscionabi\u00adlity doctrine in contract law. Section III.C defends complicity avoidance as a distinct normative logic that cannot be reduced to the dominant norma\u00adtive logic in civil procedure, procedural due process. Finally, section III.D grounds complicity avoidance in liberal political theory, according to which the state claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of coercive power and exercises that power in the name of the political community. These features of political power raise the moral stakes of delegation, threatening to implicate all of us in private wrongdoing.\r\n<h3>A. Complicity Avoidance in Civil Procedure<\/h3>\r\nIn decisions applying civil procedure\u2019s various delegation-policing doctrines, courts rarely discuss in significant detail the values served by policing delegations for abuse. But when they do, they do not focus exclu\u00ad\u00adsively on the harm suffered by victims of abusive exercises of delegated state power; they also speak of the abuse\u2019s \u201ctainting\u201d or \u201ccorrupting\u201d the civil justice system, or the wrongdoer\u2019s making the court \u201ca party to\u201d the abuse.[footnote]See infra notes 237\u2013238 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Courts also worry, in other words, about the state\u2019s becoming <em>complicit<\/em> in the abuse.\r\n\r\nThis distinct, self-regarding concern is perhaps most explicit in <em>Edmonson<\/em>, the civil <em>Batson<\/em> case. To be sure, the Court acknowledged the personal \u201cinjury to excluded jurors\u201d from discriminatory peremptory chal\u00adl\u00adenges.[footnote]Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 628 (1991).[\/footnote] But also at stake, in the Court\u2019s view, was the state\u2019s own moral integrity. \u201cBy enforcing a discriminatory peremptory challenge,\u201d the Court explained, a \u201ccourt \u2018has not only made itself a party to the [biased act], but has elected to place its power, property and prestige behind the [alleged] discrimination,\u2019\u201d and thus \u201cin a significant way has involved itself with invidious discrimination.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 624 (alterations in original) (quoting Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 725 (1961)); see also id. at 628 (\u201c[R]acial discrimination in the qualification or selection of jurors offends the dignity of persons and the integrity of the courts.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 402 (1991))).[\/footnote] This complicity in private discrimination \u201cmars the integrity of the judicial system and prevents the idea of democratic government from becoming a reality.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 628.[\/footnote] <em>Edmonson<\/em> essentially imposed an obligation on all courts to avoid complicity by refusing to give effect to discriminatory peremptory challenges\u2014that is, by withholding state support from abusive exercises of a delegated state power.\r\n\r\nIn her dissent in <em>Edmonson<\/em>, Justice O\u2019Connor rejected the majority\u2019s broad notion of state responsibility for private wrongdoing in civil litiga\u00adtion. The civil trial, as she saw it, \u201cis by design largely a stage on which private parties may act\u201d;[footnote]Id. at 632 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). But see id. at 633\u201334 (\u201cThe peremptory [challenge] is, by design, an enclave of private action in a government-managed proceeding.\u201d).[\/footnote] the state merely \u201cerects the platform\u201d and \u201cdoes not thereby become responsible for all that occurs on it.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 632; see also id. at 641 (maintaining that \u201cthe performance of a lawyer\u2019s duties in a courtroom\u201d does not constitute state action).[\/footnote] For this alternative conception of the civil trial, Justice O\u2019Connor relied pri\u00admarily on the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Polk County v.

Ackerman, 444 U.S. 193, 204 (1979)).[\/footnote] The <em>Edmonson<\/em> majority acknowledged that not every act by a party or her lawyer during civil litigation necessarily constitutes state action.[footnote]See <em>Edmonson<\/em>, 500 U.S. at 627\u201368 (explaining that in most civil cases, \u201cthe initial decision whether to sue at all, the selection of counsel, and any number of ensuing tactical choices in the course of discovery and trial may be without the requisite governmental character to be deemed state action\u201d).[\/footnote] Nonetheless, it viewed the peremptory challenge as not just another \u201cprivate function,\u201d but an exercise of delegated state power that threatened to implicate the state in the grievous moral wrong of racial discrimination.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn fairness, Justice O\u2019Connor had a point when she observed that the peremptory challenge is really not so different from other \u201cadver\u00adsarial act[s]\u201d taken during civil litigation.[footnote]Id. at 642 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] To take two examples, sum\u00admonses and subpoenas seem to share the features that, in the <em>Edmonson<\/em> Court\u2019s view, render a peremptory challenge state action: They similarly depend on \u201cthe overt, significant participation of the government,\u201d[footnote]Id. at 622 (majority opinion).[\/footnote] in that each is issued in the name of the court and is backed by the state\u2019s coercive power, and neither seems to be any less of a \u201ctraditional func\u00adtion of the government\u201d[footnote]Id. at 624.[\/footnote] than a peremptory challenge.\r\n\r\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, courts employ the logic of complicity avoidance beyond the state action context and in cases involving proce\u00addural powers other than peremptory challenges. For example, in decisions imposing sanctions under Rule 11 and the discovery rules, courts often describe the abuse of prosecution and discovery-related powers as \u201ctaint\u00ading\u201d or \u201ccorrupting\u201d the justice system or making the court \u201ca party to\u201d or even \u201ccomplicit in\u201d private wrongdoing, and they invoke sanctions as a way of removing that taint.[footnote]See, e.g., Xyngular Corp. v. Schenkel, 200 F. Supp. 3d 1273, 1328 (D. Utah 2016) (\u201cAnything short of dismissal will fail to remove the taint that Schenkel has caused and fail to adequately deter future litigants from engaging in this type of self-help discovery.\u201d); see also Mark v. New Orleans City, No. 15-7103, 2017 WL 2152367, at *6 (E.D. La.

Del Taco, Inc., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1031 (C.D. Cal. 2005))).[\/footnote] Similar rhetoric appears in abuse-of-process and malicious-prosecution decisions.[footnote]See Cordes v. Outdoor Living Ctr., Inc., 781 S.W.2d 31, 34 (Ark. 1989) (likening abuse of process to extortion or coercion, and noting the possibility that the process might be \u201ctainted by a willful act\u201d of one of the parties); Antur Realty Corp. v.

Jones, 71 N.W. 558, 565\u201366 (N.D. 1897) (\u201cIf the law will not punish such conduct\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the courts themselves will seem to have forsaken their high function as protectors and vindicators of invaded rights, and to have become, instead, the accomplices of evil men.\u201d).[\/footnote] Whether or not the exercise of these other procedural powers formally constitutes state action as a mat\u00adter of constitutional law, courts view the abuse of those powers as breach\u00ading the public\u2013private divide and staining the state\u2019s moral integrity.\r\n\r\nThe notion of complicity in these decisions does not depend on the narrower conception of a delegation articulated by public law scholars such as Davis and Metzger.[footnote]See supra notes 68\u201375, 143\u2013145 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] The state can, in other words, become com\u00adplicit in an abusive exercise of delegated state power even though the private party wielding that power isn\u2019t acting on the government\u2019s behalf or constrained to pursue its purposes. In <em>Edmonson<\/em>, for instance, the Court perceived a threat of complicity, notwithstanding the fact that pri\u00advate par\u00adties may legitimately exercise peremptory challenges for their own ends.[footnote]See <em>Edmonson<\/em>, 500 U.S. at 626 (\u201cThough the motive of a peremptory challenge may be to protect a private interest, the objective of jury selection proceedings is to determine representation on a governmental body.\u201d).[\/footnote] The risk of complicity arises not because private parties are stand\u00ading in for the state but because they are exercising its coercive powers. This means that the state faces a pervasive risk of complicity in civil litiga\u00adtion. Because a private party need not be authorized to act as the state\u2019s agent in order to render it complicit in her wrongdoing, <em>every<\/em> exercise of delegated state power in civil litigation potentially implicates the state\u2019s moral integrity. And because there is a fine line between a legitimate pri\u00advate purpose and an improper one\u2014an aggressive discovery request, for example, can quickly shade into a vexatious one\u2014a significant number of those exer\u00adcises of delegated power will in fact prove to be abusive, and thus, for the state, corrupting.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines only mitigate the threat of complicity rather than eliminate it. They do so to varying degrees. The delegation-rescinding doctrines afford the state the most protection, deeming the risk of complicity too great to allow private parties to continue to exercise state power unsupervised by state officials. The doctrines that withhold enforcement from certain exercises of dele\u00adgated power, by contrast, are somewhat more permissive: They allow pri\u00advate parties to continue to exercise\u2014and thus to abuse\u2014delegated state powers but refuse to lend the state\u2019s support to exercises of those powers that offend especially important public values. Finally, the doctrines that punish abusive exercises of delegated state power tolerate the most complicity, censuring only the worst forms of abuse after they have occurred. Given the limits of the various delegation-policing strategies, the state ends up incurring a good deal of complicity in abusive exercises of delegated power that can be neither thwarted nor repudiated. This is by no means to deny the significant benefits of delegating procedural powers to private parties.[footnote]These benefits are discussed further at infra section III.D.2.[\/footnote] But we should also recognize that those bene\u00adfits come at a considerable moral cost to the state.[footnote]In this respect, civil procedure provides private parties with a moral subsidy\u2014not just the financial subsidy that other scholars have identified. See, e.g., Judith Resnik, Money Matters: Judicial Market Interventions Creating Subsidies and Awarding Fees and Costs in Individual and Aggregate Litigation, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2119, 2131\u201337 (2000) (identifying various taxpayer-financed subsidies for civil litigants); Stephen J. Ware, Is Adjudication a Public Good? \u201cOvercrowded Courts\u201d and the Private Sector Alternative of Arbitration, 14 Cardozo J. Conflict Resol. 899, 900 (2013) (criticizing the civil justice system for squander\u00ading \u201cpublic resources that would be better spent on parties who deserve the subsidy\u201d). I plan to explore this idea further in future work.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. Complicity Avoidance Beyond Civil Procedure<\/h3>\r\nCivil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines represent a distinctly procedural response to a distinctly procedural problem. Ordinary civil litigation delegates a number of procedural powers to private parties. In abusing those powers, private parties can render the state complicit in their wrongdoing. The delegation-policing doctrines, in their different ways, allow the state to avoid that complicity by distancing itself from pri\u00advate parties\u2019 exercises of delegated procedural powers.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the threat of complicity arises from the <em>substance<\/em> of a party\u2019s legal claims. Even when private parties exercise delegated procedural powers scrupulously, they can still jeopardize the state\u2019s moral integrity if they are using civil litigation to seek the state\u2019s support for some objectionable goal and the substantive law entitles them to relief. This different iteration of the complicity problem calls for different, <em>substantive<\/em> complicity-avoidance doctrines\u2014rules of substantive law that alter the content of a given cause of action in a way that thwarts private parties\u2019 attempts to use civil litigation to achieve certain repugnant ends. Attend\u00ading to these doctrines not only reveals a deep connection between procedure and substance but also gives a fuller sense of the kinds of pri\u00advate wrongdoing that trigger complicity concerns. This section considers two substantive complicity-avoidance doctrines: the version of the state action doctrine applied in <em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em> and Seana Shiffrin\u2019s revision\u00adist account of the unconscionability doctrine in contract law.\r\n\r\n<em>Shelley<\/em> held that a State court\u2019s enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant is \u201cstate action\u201d that violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 14\u201320 (1948).[\/footnote] While the Court relied on precedents holding that official judicial action is state action,[footnote]See id. at 14.[\/footnote] it never clearly explained how private parties\u2019 discriminatory motives can taint a judicial decision. The Court\u2019s reasoning, however, indicates that the constitutional violation in <em>Shelley<\/em> must have amounted to state complicity in private discrimination. The Court never suggested that either of the States involved had itself engaged in any discriminatory conduct. Rather, the State courts had faci\u00adlitated <em>private<\/em> discrimination by giving effect to discriminatory private agreements. Their responsibility for the discrimination was therefore secondary rather than primary. This is reflected in the language of the Court\u2019s opinion, which described the State courts\u2019 enforcement of the restrictive covenants as the \u201c[p]articipation of the State\u201d in private discrimination.[footnote]Id. at 13.[\/footnote] And while acknowledging that \u201cthe particular pattern of discrimination\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. was defined initially by the terms of a private agree\u00adment,\u201d the Court noted that \u201c[t]he judicial action\u201d of enforcing that discrimination \u201cbears the clear and unmistakable imprimatur of the State.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 20.[\/footnote] Such language describes the role of the accomplice, not the principal.\r\n\r\nThe private wrongdoing that the State courts had facilitated was a matter of the substance of the restrictive covenants, rather than anything the parties had done during the litigation to enforce them. The Court accordingly had to look to substantive law to develop a strategy for avoiding state complicity in that wrongdoing. Given that the racially restrictive covenants were enforceable under each State\u2019s common law of property, the Court essentially ordered the States to revise their common law to no longer recognize such agreements,[footnote]See id. at 19, 22.[\/footnote] thereby making the agreements solely a matter of \u201cvoluntary adherence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 13.[\/footnote] By refusing to coercively enforce the racially restrictive covenants, the Court believed, the States could extricate themselves from that private discrimination. That is the logic of complicity avoidance.\r\n\r\nThis account by no means solves the perennial puzzle surrounding <em>Shelley<\/em>: how to cabin its holding to prevent constitutional law from subsuming nearly all of private law. The Supreme Court has itself balked at <em>Shelley<\/em>\u2019s most sweeping implications, significantly reining in the state action doctrine in subsequent decisions.[footnote]See Davis, supra note 18, at 594 n.40 (explaining that <em>Shelley<\/em> was the closest the Court has come to treating \u201cevery private action as state action\u201d but further noting that the Court \u201chas never read that case for all it may be worth\u201d).[\/footnote] But the Court and commenta\u00adtors alike have failed to articulate a coherent, principled basis for limiting <em>Shelley<\/em>\u2019s logic.[footnote]See, e.g., Sunstein, Partial Constitution, supra note 47, at 56, 73 (noting that <em>Shelley<\/em> is \u201cextremely controversial\u201d and that the \u201cpuzzle of the case\u201d lies in the fact that \u201cjudicial enforcement of voluntary agreements is not normally thought to violate the Constitution\u201d); Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1697 (2d ed. 1988) (arguing that the Court\u2019s modern state action decisions \u201cappear peculiarly unpersuasive\u201d in purporting to \u201carticulate and apply an autonomous state action doctrine\u201d); Mark Tushnet, Weak Courts, Strong Rights: Judicial Review and Social Welfare Rights in Comparative Constitutional Law 167 (2008) (explaining that the rule established in <em>Shelley<\/em> can be difficult to apply in other state action cases); cf. Charles L. Black, Jr., The Supreme Court, 1966 Term\u2014Foreword: \u201cState Action,\u201d Equal Protection, and California\u2019s Proposition 14, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 69, 95 (1967) (calling the state action doctrine \u201ca conceptual disaster area\u201d).[\/footnote] In light of that failure, we could simply dismiss <em>Shelley<\/em> as a (necessary and justified) realist aberration, the high-water mark of the Court\u2019s attempt to extend federal judicial oversight over as many discrim\u00adinatory practices as possible. A less ad hoc response would be to accept the full breadth of <em>Shelley<\/em>\u2019s articulation of the state action doctrine and to focus on determining when the state should refuse to lend its support to private wrongdoing. It may be better to candidly acknowledge the extent of the state\u2019s potential involvement in private wrongdoing and to consi\u00adder when the state has a duty to repudiate it than to occlude the moral costs of our commitment to private ordering by simply pretending that the state isn\u2019t implicated.[footnote]Cf. Sunstein, Partial Constitution, supra note 47, at 160 (\u201c<em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. was a remarkably easy state action case.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The case was difficult only because it is unclear whether the Constitution forbids the state\u2019s apparently neutral use of its courts to enforce contracts, including racially restrictive property agreements.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nRead as a complicity-avoidance decision, <em>Shelley<\/em> identifies a problem that, far from being limited to constitutional law\u2019s state action doctrine, recurs throughout the law. Consider the unconscionability doctrine in contract law, as reconceptualized by Shiffrin.[footnote]See generally Shiffrin, Paternalism, supra note 25. For a recent critique of Shiffrin\u2019s account, see Nicolas Cornell, A Complainant-Oriented Approach to Unconscionability and Contract Law, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1131, 1153\u201357 (2016).[\/footnote] The unconscionability doctrine allows courts to refuse to enforce an otherwise valid contract the terms of which were manifestly unfair or immoral at the time the agree\u00adment was formed.[footnote]See <strong>U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a02-302(1) (Am. Law Inst. &amp; Unif. Law Comm\u2019n 2003); <\/strong>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a0208 (Am. Law Inst. 1981).[\/footnote] Both critics[footnote]See, e.g., Charles Fried, Contract as Promise 104 (1981); Alan Schwartz, A Reexamination of Nonsubstantive Unconscionability, 63 Va. L. Rev. 1053, 1071\u201376 (1977).[\/footnote] and defenders[footnote]See, e.g., Duncan Kennedy, Distributive and Paternalist Motives in Contract and Tort Law, with Special Reference to Compulsory Terms and Unequal Bargaining Power, 41 Md. L. Rev. 563, 631\u201338 (1982); Anthony T. Kronman, Paternalism and the Law of Contracts, 92 Yale L.J. 763, 764 (1983).[\/footnote] of the doctrine have viewed it as paternalistic, since it relieves one of the parties to a con\u00adtract of her freely assumed obligations when they prove to have been unwise. Against this consensus, Shiffrin contends that the unconscionability doc\u00adtrine need not be paternalistic, depending on the state\u2019s motive in deploy\u00ading it. Insofar as the state uses the doctrine simply to protect the weaker party to a contract from the bad consequences of her decision, then it is indeed paternalistic. But that is not the state\u2019s only possible purpose. Instead, the state\u2019s \u201cmotive may reasonably be a self-regarding concern not to facilitate or assist harmful, exploitative, or immoral action.\u201d[footnote]Shiffrin, Paternalism, supra note 25, at 224.[\/footnote] This \u201cself-regarding concern\u201d arises because \u201cthe legal institu\u00adtion of contract requires, through their role in enforcement, the participation and cooper\u00adation of parties outside the agreement\u2014that is, it requires the cooperation of the community, as it is embodied in the state.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 221.[\/footnote] So rather than bespeaking an other-regarding concern for the weaker party\u2019s well-being, the \u201cstate\u2019s refusal to enforce an unconscionable contract could reflect an unwillingness to lend <em>its<\/em> support and its force to assist an exploitative contract because it is an unworthy endeavor to support.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 223\u201330, 249\u201350.[\/footnote] One sees this alternative motivation at work in many of the decisions applying the doctrine, in which \u201ca dominant concern of judges is self-regarding: it is to avoid facilitating the actions of an exploiter rather than to act to protect the disadvantaged party.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 229 (citing illustrative cases).[\/footnote] That, of course, is precisely the same concern as in <em>Shelley<\/em>.[footnote]Shiffrin briefly makes the connection to <em>Shelley<\/em>. See id. at 233 n.34.[\/footnote] Shiffrin thus reconceptualizes unconscionability as a complicity-avoidance doctrine.[footnote]One can give a similar account of other contract law doctrines that allow courts to refuse to enforce private agreements on grounds of \u201cpublic policy.\u201d Beyond contract law, another potential example of a substantive complicity-avoidance doctrine is the equitable \u201cclean hands\u201d defense, which has traditionally been justified as a way for courts to avoid abetting or countenancing private wrongdoing and to thereby preserve their \u201cintegrity.\u201d See Ori J. Herstein, A Normative Theory of the Clean Hands Defense, 17 Legal Theory 171, 176\u201378 (2011). But see id. at 188\u201389 (doubting whether the kinds of wrongdoing that typically trigger the clean hands defense rise to the level of implicating the political community).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile substantive, both <em>Shelley<\/em> and unconscionability respond to the same fundamental problem as civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines. Whether by abusing delegated procedural powers or by seeking public support for their immoral projects, private parties can render the state complicit in their wrongdoing. <em>Shelley<\/em> and unconsciona\u00adbility, just like civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines, enable the state to avoid the worst forms of complicity.\r\n<h3>C. Complicity Avoidance, Not Due Process<\/h3>\r\nIf the logic of complicity avoidance underlies important doctrines in civil procedure (among other legal domains), one might wonder why it has escaped scholarly attention. The neglect may well owe to the hege\u00admony of another normative logic in civil procedure doctrine and scholar\u00adship: procedural due process. In answering almost any procedural question, courts and scholars alike reflexively invoke due process\u2014if not the concept itself, then at least its constituent values, such as fairness and accuracy. Many readers thus might doubt the distinctiveness of complicity avoidance and instead try to assimilate it to due process. There is consid\u00aderable support for such a move, as both courts and commentators have conceptualized delegation problems in other areas of the law in due process terms.[footnote]See, e.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co. 298 U.S. 238, 326, 330\u201332 (1936) (analyzing the validity of the price-setting provisions in the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause); Davis, supra note 18, at 615\u201321 (identifying due process limits on private enforcement of regulatory laws); Lawrence, supra note 42, at 672\u201395 (considering \u201cthe due process approach for handling private delegation\u201d); Rubenfeld, supra note 39, at 11\u201319 (discussing the applicability of the Due Process Clause to Title IX investigations and adjudications conducted by private schools).[\/footnote] Yet, while civil procedure\u2019s delegations of state power can indeed raise significant due process concerns, those concerns hardly exhaust the delegations\u2019 normative significance. Even after accounting for the threat to due process values, there remains the problem of state complicity in abusive exercises of delegated power\u2014a problem that civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines are well tailored to address.\r\n\r\nProcedural due process has two main features, neither of which quite fits the structure of civil procedure\u2019s delegation problem. First, procedural due process reflects an ex ante concern with promoting accuracy in governmental decisionmaking. The Supreme Court has construed the Due Process Clause to require the government to follow certain procedures before depriving people of their property (or, less relevant in the civil context, their lives or liberty).[footnote]See, e.g., Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80 (1972). Thus, the question in the canonical procedural due process cases of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), and Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), was whether recipients of certain federal benefits were entitled to a hearing before the government terminated their benefits.[\/footnote] According to the Court, the purpose of this requirement is \u201cto minimize substantively unfair or mistaken deprivations of property\u201d by the government.[footnote]<em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 81.[\/footnote] Procedural due process thus seeks to prevent erroneous deprivations of property by prescribing procedures that enhance the accuracy of govern\u00admental decisionmaking.[footnote]See, e.g., Lawrence A. Alexander, Cutting the Gordian Knot: State Action and Self-Help Repossession, 2 Hastings Const. L.Q. 893, 917\u201318 (1975) (\u201cThe basic purpose of the procedural due process requirements associated with the right to a hearing on adjudicative facts\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is to minimize error in the finding of adjudicative facts.\u201d). Some scholars have attempted to ground due process in values other than accuracy. See, e.g., Jerry L. Mashaw, Due Process in the Administrative State 158\u2013253 (1985) (developing a dignitarian theory of due process); Lawrence B. Solum, Procedural Justice, 78 S. Cal. L. Rev. 181, 273\u201384 (2004) (arguing that participatory procedures enhance the legitimacy of governmental decisions). These alternative conceptions of due process, however, can still be distinguished from complicity avoidance on the second ground considered in this section.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCivil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines, by contrast, reflect an ex post concern that goes beyond accurate decisionmaking. Even when a civil justice system institutes procedures that reduce the risk of erroneous outcomes to a tolerable level, those procedures will not forestall every abuse of delegated state power. Nor will every kind of abuse compromise the accuracy of the decisionmaking process. Yet civil procedure still employs delegation-policing doctrines, which seek to address abusive exercises of delegated state power as they are occurring or after they have occurred, and irrespective of their effect on the accuracy of the ultimate decision. Traditional notions of due process can\u2019t readily account for that function; complicity avoidance can.\r\n\r\nOnce again, civil <em>Batson<\/em> exemplifies the divergence between civil pro\u00adcedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines and procedural due process. The Court in <em>Edmonson<\/em> admittedly adverted to due process concerns in justifying a ban on racially discriminatory peremptory challenges in civil trials, noting how \u201c[r]ace discrimination within the courtroom raises serious questions as to the fairness of the proceedings conducted there.\u201d[footnote]Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 628 (1991).[\/footnote] It is also true that the traditional justifications for peremptory challenges sound in due process.[footnote]See id. at 633 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cBy allowing the litigant to strike jurors for even the most subtle of discerned biases, the peremptory challenge fosters both the perception and reality of an impartial jury.\u201d).[\/footnote] But <em>Edmonson<\/em>\u2019s holding is both underinclusive and overinclusive with respect to due process values. Rather than specify ex ante various accuracy-undermining bases for making peremptory challenges, the Court subjected peremptory challenges to ex post review solely for discrimination. And rather than permit race-based peremptory challenges that may be grounded in empirically justified generalizations, the Court proscribed all race-based peremptory challenges categori\u00adcally.[footnote]Id. at 630\u201331.[\/footnote] These aspects of <em>Edmonson<\/em>\u2019s holding belie the suggestion that the Court was trying to enhance the overall accuracy of civil jury trials. They instead suggest that the Court was trying to avoid state complicity in pri\u00advate discrimination as such.\r\n\r\nSecond, procedural due process is concerned with <em>direct<\/em> state action, whereas civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines are concerned with <em>indirect <\/em>state action. Due process constrains what the state may do <em>to<\/em> private parties\u2014the delegation-policing doctrines, what it may do <em>for<\/em> private parties. Consider the prejudgment attachment and replevin cases. Those cases were formally adjudicated under the Due Process Clause, and the Court repeatedly emphasized the importance of predeprivation hearings for promoting accurate decisionmaking.[footnote]See, e.g., Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 13 (1991); <em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 80\u201382.[\/footnote] But the Court also acknowledged that while in those cases \u201cthe inquiry is similar\u201d to the traditional due process analysis, \u201cthe focus is different.\u201d[footnote]<em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 10.[\/footnote] Specifically, \u201c[p]rejudgment remedy statutes ordinarily apply to disputes between private parties rather than between an individual and the government,\u201d and as such \u201care designed to enable one of the parties to \u2018make use of state procedures with the overt, significant assistance of state officials.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id. at 10\u201311 (quoting Tulsa Prof\u2019l Collection Servs., Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988)).[\/footnote] The state\u2019s role, in other words, is limited to facilitating, rather than directly regulating, private conduct. The Court thus had to gerrymander the three-pronged due process balancing test articulated in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge<\/em>,[footnote]424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).[\/footnote] according \u201cprincipal attention\u201d to \u201cthe interest of the party seeking the prejudgment remedy\u201d rather than to any interest of the government.[footnote]<em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 11.[\/footnote] More than just a minor doctrinal tweak, this modification fundamentally reconfigured the role of the state in the due process analysis. The concept of complicity avoidance makes that reconfiguration seem less ad hoc.\r\n\r\nFor there to be state complicity, of course, there must be some under\u00adlying private wrong for the state to be complicit <em>in<\/em>. And one can indeed conceptualize some of the wrongs addressed by civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines in due process terms, as some involve, or contribute to, an arbitrary deprivation of property. But not all of them. From civil <em>Batson<\/em> to Rule 11 to the abuse-of-process tort, the problem is not that someone was or might be arbitrarily deprived of her property\u2014some of the doctrines can be triggered without any deprivation at all\u2014but that a private party has compromised certain public values in exer\u00adcising state power. In any event, even when the underlying wrong does implicate due process, the state\u2019s role remains only secondary rather than primary. The state does not act of its own initiative but rather lends its coercive apparatus to private parties so they can achieve their own ends. Complicity avoidance provides a distinct normative framework for thinking about the state\u2019s obligations when it has delegated its coercive power to private parties rather than exercising that power itself.\r\n<h3>D. Defending Complicity Avoidance\u2014and Delegation<\/h3>\r\nThe complicity-avoidance logic employed in cases such as <em>Edmonson<\/em> is not just a doctrinal construct. As this section argues, that logic reso\u00adnates with fundamental principles of liberal political theory. The aim, to be clear, is not to provide a definitive defense of complicity avoidance but to show it to be a normatively attractive ideal in light of our legal system\u2019s other commitments. At the same time, complicity avoidance comes at a cost: In attempting to avoid complicity in private wrongdoing, the state forgoes many of the benefits associated with delegating state power to private parties in the first place. The upshot, this section suggests, is that sometimes there are good reasons for the state\u2014and thus the entire politi\u00adcal community\u2014to tolerate a degree of complicity in private wrongdoing.\r\n\r\n1. <em>The Political Theory of Complicity Avoidance<\/em>. \u2014 Civil procedure\u2019s delegations of state power run up against one of the most basic tenets of liberal political theory: that the defining feature of political power is its coerciveness and that the central task of political theory is legitimating and limiting that coercion. Contemporary liberalism proceeds from the premise, most prominently associated with Max Weber, that the modern state claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force.[footnote]See Max Weber, The Profession and Vocation of Politics (1919), reprinted in <em>Weber: Political Writings<\/em> 310 (Peter Lassman &amp; Ronald Speirs eds., 1994).[\/footnote] This premise gives rise to the need to specify the conditions that legitimate the state\u2019s use of coercion, which, in turn, involves identifying limits on the state\u2019s coercive power.[footnote]See, e.g., Ronald Dworkin, Law\u2019s Empire 191 (1986) (describing \u201cthe classical problem of the legitimacy of coercive power\u201d).[\/footnote] These imperatives explain public law\u2019s enduring focus on constraining state action.[footnote]See Amitai Etzioni, Reining in Private Agents, 101 Minn. L. Rev. Headnotes 279, 279 (2016), http:\/\/www.minnesotalawreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Etzioni.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/KCJ8-TAX3] (\u201cThe Constitution and much of statutory law seek to protect individual rights from intrusions by the government. It is the government\u2019s coercive power that must be constrained.\u201d); Daryl J. Levinson, The Supreme Court 2015 Term\u2014Foreword: Looking for Power in Public Law, 130 Harv. L. Rev. 31, 46 &amp; n.79 (2016) (arguing that a primary ambition of constitutionalism is to constrain state power).[\/footnote] They also account for the more recent anxiety about the \u201cprivatization\u201d of various state functions[footnote]See supra notes 1\u20132, 140 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]: If state power is necessarily coercive, and if that power must be subject to certain limits to be legitimate, then delegating state power to private par\u00adties threatens to untether state coercion from its legitimating constraints. All of this is reason enough to carefully attend to civil procedure\u2019s delegations of state power and its delegation-policing doctrines.\r\n\r\nA concern with coercion alone, however, doesn\u2019t fully explain courts\u2019 additional concern with complicity in abusive exercises of delegated state power. To appreciate that further worry, one must understand the special nature of political power in a liberal democracy. The political philosopher John Rawls, synthesizing the liberal social-contract tradition, famously argued that democratic political power is distinctive not just because of its coerciveness but also because of its authorship. \u201c[W]hile political power is always coercive power,\u201d Rawls explained, \u201cin a constitutional regime it is the power of the public, that is, the power of free and equal citizens as a collective body.\u201d[footnote]John Rawls, Political Liberalism 68 (1996) [hereinafter Rawls, Political Liberalism].[\/footnote] In a democracy, in other words, political power is ulti\u00admately \u201ccitizens\u2019 power\u201d[footnote]John Rawls, Justice as Fairness: A Restatement 40\u201341 (Erin Kelly ed., 2001).[\/footnote]\u2014\u201ca power in which all citizens have an equal share.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 183\u201384. This conception of political power differs fundamentally from that of genuine libertarianism (as distinct from \u201cclassical\u201d versions of liberalism), which reduces political power to a \u201cnetwork of private contracts\u201d and accordingly denies the existence of any separate \u201cpublic\u201d realm. Samuel Freeman, Illiberal Libertarians: Why Libertarianism Is Not a Liberal View, 30 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff. 105, 107 (2001). For liberals, by contrast, the establishment of political institutions constitutes a distinct public domain subject to a distinct set of normative principles. Cf. Samuel Scheffler, Membership and Political Obligation, 25 J. Pol. Phil. 3, 16 (2017) (\u201c[T]he very idea of a \u2018public\u2019 is a creation of political society; there is no public in the state of nature.\u201d).[\/footnote] It is thus doubly public: As coercive power, it\u2019s vested with the state, per the monopoly of physical force; and as democratic power, it\u2019s col\u00adlectively authorized by the political community, per the social contract.[footnote]But see James Q. Whitman, Between Self-Defense and Vengeance\/Between Social Contract and Monopoly of Violence, 39 Tulsa L. Rev. 901, 902 (2004) (presenting the social contract and monopoly of violence as two opposing theories of the state).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis means that the political community has a lot riding, morally speaking, on how the state exercises its coercive power. As Arthur Ripstein has explained, because political power in a democracy is authorized by the political community as a whole, the state speaks in the name of the political community whenever it exercises power through any of its institutions.[footnote]See Arthur Ripstein, Private Order and Public Justice: Kant and Rawls, 92 Va. L. Rev. 1391, 1435 (2006) [hereinafter Ripstein, Private Order].[\/footnote] That includes when courts resolve private disputes through civil litigation, which is among those \u201cprocedures and institutions [that] can decide to act on behalf of everyone.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1428; see also Ripstein, Private Wrongs, supra note 51, at 289 (\u201cA court resolving a private dispute purports to speak from\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a public standpoint\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 420 (\u201c[T]he judiciary serves as the community\u2019s voice, levying its response to an abrogation of a publicly recognized responsibility.\u201d).[\/footnote] The political community thus bears ultimate responsibility for how the state exercises its coercive power, including how its courts adjudicate private disputes.[footnote]See Ripstein, Private Order, supra note 282, at 1435.[\/footnote] And when the state abuses its power, the political community becomes complicit in that wrongdoing.[footnote]For more on the idea that the citizens of a democracy collectively authorize, and thus bear responsibility for, many of the acts of their government, see generally Eric Beerbohm, In Our Name: The Ethics of Democracy (2012); John M. Parrish, Collective Responsibility and the State, 1 Int\u2019l Theory 119 (2009); Anna Stilz, Collective Responsibility and the State, 19 J. Pol. Phil. 190 (2011). But see Robert Jubb, Participation in and Responsibility for State Injustices, 40 Soc. Theory &amp; Prac. 51, 52\u201353 (2014) (criticizing this idea).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nYet the liberal account of political power has much more sweeping implications for the civil justice system than liberal political theorists have appreciated. They tend to equate exercises of state power in civil litiga\u00adtion with judicial action, and thus assume that the political community\u2019s complicity extends only as far as the decisions of courts. But as this Article has shown, the state doesn\u2019t maintain exclusive control over its coercive power in civil litigation. To be sure, as liberal political theorists have rightly emphasized, the main point of a civil justice system is to provide authoritative, <em>public<\/em> resolutions of private disputes.[footnote]See Ripstein, Private Order, supra note 282, at 1415\u201329.[\/footnote] Along the way, though, the state permits <em>private<\/em> parties to exercise various procedural powers.[footnote]See supra section I.B.[\/footnote] As coercive powers of a democratic state, those powers are still authorized by the members of the political community and exercised in their name. The political community thus remains collectively respon\u00adsible for how private parties exercise the delegated state powers during civil litigation. Given the nature of democratic political power and the division of labor between private parties and courts in civil litigation, the complicity that concerns courts in cases such as <em>Edmonson<\/em> turns out to be not just the complicity of the state but the complicity of us all.[footnote]This Article\u2019s complicity-avoidance theory of civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines shares certain affinities with Malcolm Thorburn\u2019s public law theory of criminal law\u2019s justification defenses. See Malcolm Thorburn, Criminal Law as Public Law, <em>in<\/em> Philosophical Foundations of Criminal Law 21 (R.A. Duff &amp; Stuart P. Green eds., 2011); Malcolm Thorburn, Justifications, Powers, and Authority, 117 Yale L.J. 1070, 1118 (2008) [hereinafter Thorburn, Justifications]. But whereas Thorburn focuses on emergency situations in which private parties must temporarily \u201cstand in\u201d for state officials, see Thorburn, Justifications, supra, at 1076, 1107, 1118, 1125\u201326, this Article contends that civil procedure delegates coercive state power to private parties on a continuing, rather than emergency, basis, and that private parties don\u2019t \u201cstand in\u201d for the state but rather are permitted to use delegated state power primarily for their own purposes.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2. <em>Balancing Complicity Avoidance and Delegation<\/em>. \u2014 If the political community can indeed become complicit in private exercises of delegated state power during civil litigation, then perhaps we should just eliminate the risk of complicity by eliminating the delegations. Rather than delegate the state\u2019s coercive prosecutorial, investigatory, and adjudi\u00adcatory powers to potentially faithless private parties, the safer course might be to vest those powers exclusively with more accountable governmental officials. And yet, while civil procedure\u2019s delegations entail significant moral costs for the state\u2014much more significant than civil procedure scholars have appreciated\u2014they also promise significant benefits. Those benefits counsel against eliminating civil procedure\u2019s delegations and in favor of taking the very approach civil procedure in fact takes: delegating many of the state\u2019s procedural powers to private parties but policing those delegations for abuse.\r\n\r\nMany of the benefits of civil procedure\u2019s delegations have been well canvassed in the literature and are present across the civil docket, both in private law and public law cases. In private law cases, delegating the civil prosecutorial power to private parties empowers the victims of private wrongs to directly vindicate their rights[footnote]This is one of the main insights of civil recourse theory. See Goldberg &amp; Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs, supra note 50, at 981\u201382 (arguing that civil recourse \u201cenables individuals to assert claims as a matter of right without first obtaining the permission or blessing of government officials\u201d); cf. Nagareda, supra note 18, at 191 (\u201cIn general, one of the advantages of civil litigation lies in the ability of a private person to lodge a complaint in a manner independent from the government.\u201d).[\/footnote] and reposes prosecutorial discretion with those individuals who experience the costs and benefits of civil litigation most acutely.[footnote]See Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 433 (\u201c[W]ith the duties of \u2018private\u2019 law, because private parties bear the brunt of their burdens as well as the effects of their violation, we generally assign private parties the power to pursue their vindication, despite the underlying, concomitant public interest.\u201d).[\/footnote] In cases with a public law dimension, schol\u00adars have recognized a number of additional benefits associated with the private enforcement of federal statutes, mostly stemming from various practical advantages that private parties enjoy over administrative agencies, including less vulnerability to capture, stronger enforcement incentives, more resources, and greater access to information.[footnote]For a good overview of these benefits, see Clopton, Redundant, supra note 14, at 308\u201311; see also, e.g., Pamela H. Bucy, Private Justice, 76 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 54\u201360 (2002) (considering the investigative and informational advantages of private parties); Stephen B. Burbank, Sean Farhang &amp; Herbert M. Kritzer, Private Enforcement, 17 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 637, 662\u201367 (2013) (evaluating commonly made arguments regarding the benefits of private enforcement, including increasing prosecutorial resources, shifting costs from public to private sources, and \u201cfacilitat[ing] participatory and democratic governance\u201d); Margaret H. Lemos &amp; Max Minzner, For-Profit Public Enforcement, 127 Harv. L. Rev. 853, 912\u201313 (2014) (noting that \u201c[f]inancial incentives blur the line between public and private enforcement\u201d); Matthew C. Stephenson, Public Regulation of Private Enforcement: The Case for Expanding the Role of Administrative Agencies, 91 Va. L. Rev. 93, 106\u201320 (2005) (discussing the potential advantages and disadvantages of private enforcement). Scholars have ascribed similar benefits to party-driven discovery. See, e.g., Carrington, supra note 96, at 55 (suggesting that discovery has helped to enable private enforcement and reduce demand for government or bureaucratic intervention); Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 356 (arguing that limits on discovery should be calibrated so as to preserve \u201cthe civil enforcement role\u201d performed by private litigation). Beyond practical considerations, private enforcement responds to Americans\u2019 traditional ideological distrust of governmental power. See generally Robert Kagan, Adversarial Legalism: The American Way of Law (2001) (connecting the United States\u2019 preference for private enforcement to Americans\u2019 suspicion of the state).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDelegating state power has another set of interrelated benefits that have more to do with political morality than efficient policy implementa\u00adtion. Scholars have explored these benefits in the context of settlement and various forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), but they seem to apply to the private exercise of other state procedural powers as well. Most directly, delegating state procedural powers to private parties pro\u00admotes individual autonomy by giving individuals some say over the resolution of their disputes.[footnote]See Carrie Menkel-Meadow, Whose Dispute Is It Anyway?: A Philosophical and Democratic Defense of Settlement (in Some Cases), 83 Geo. L.J. 2663, 2692 (1995) (\u201cSettlements that are in fact consensual represent the goals of democratic and party-initiated legal regimes by allowing the parties themselves to choose processes and outcomes for dispute resolution.\u201d); see also Edward Brunet, The Core Values of Arbitration, <em>in<\/em> Edward Brunet et al., Arbitration Law in America: A Critical Assessment 3 (2006) (making a similar autonomy-based argument for arbitration).[\/footnote] Because of civil procedure\u2019s delegations, private parties can (within wide limits) delineate the contours of their dispute in terms of claims and parties, decide how much and what kinds of information they will exchange with each other during discovery, and even set the terms of any resolution itself through settlement. This autonomy, in turn, promises two further benefits. First, rather than stoke atomism, allowing private parties to exercise the state\u2019s procedural powers might actually foster communal solidarity, on the theory that people develop a closer attachment to the law by enforcing it them\u00adselves.[footnote]See Menkel-Meadow, supra note 292, at 2688\u201389 (arguing that settlement can allow for greater participation, and thus a closer connection to the law, than litigation); cf. Jody Freeman, Extending Public Law Norms Through Privatization, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1285, 1285 (2003) (arguing that \u201cprivatization can be a means of \u2018publicization,\u2019 through which private actors increasingly commit themselves to traditionally public goals\u201d).[\/footnote] Second, delegation is also a way for the state to accommodate pluralism. Some members of a liberal political community will inevitably espouse values different from those embodied in the law and other political institutions.[footnote]This results from what Rawls called the \u201cfact of reasonable pluralism.\u201d Rawls, Political Liberalism, supra note 278, at 36.[\/footnote] By delegating its procedural powers, the state gives private parties space to express those values in the course of resolving their disputes.[footnote]See Menkel-Meadow, supra note 292, at 2672\u201378 (arguing that settlement allows disputes to be decided according to values other than those embodied in the law); see also Robert M. Ackerman, Disputing Together: Conflict Resolution and the Search for Community, 18 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 27, 67\u201369 (2002) (identifying various communitarian benefits of arbitration). This is one of the main justifications given for religious arbitration and, more generally, arbitration of disputes between the members of a close-knit community. See, e.g., Michael A. Helfand, Arbitration\u2019s Counter-Narrative: The Religious Arbitration Paradigm, 124 Yale. L.J. 2994, 3010\u201322 (2015) (discussing how arbitration can \u201cadvance a shared set of objectives and values\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn light of delegation\u2019s benefits, the state might be drawn toward the opposite extreme. Rather than avoid complicity in private wrongdoing by eliminating civil procedure\u2019s delegations and exercising all coercive procedural powers itself, the state might try to get out of the dispute-resolution business altogether, leaving it exclusively to private ordering.[footnote]Cf. Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 644 (considering a \u201cmodel of disengage\u00adment\u201d whereby judges would extricate themselves from settlement negotiations).[\/footnote] This strategy, however, runs up against another core liberal commitment: the state\u2019s obligation to provide a forum for the authoritative resolution of private disputes.[footnote]See supra note 286 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Radin, Threat, supra note 46, at 295\u201397 (describing liberalism\u2019s conception of the state\u2019s role in resolving private disputes).[\/footnote] Indeed, liberalism has traditionally viewed the adju\u00addication of private disputes as a way to augment the state\u2019s authority and enhance its legitimacy.[footnote]See, e.g., Stephen Holmes, The Anatomy of Antiliberalism 201\u201310 (1993); cf. Judith Resnik &amp; Dennis E. Curtis, Representing Justice: Invention, Controversy, and Rights in City-States and Democratic Courtrooms 338 (2011) (showing how throughout history courthouses and other sites of public dispute resolution have symbolized state authority).[\/footnote] Liberalism thus creates a dilemma for the state: If the state attempts to avoid complicity in private wrongdoing by exercising all coercive power itself, it forgoes the considerable benefits of delegation; but if it attempts to avoid complicity by completely out\u00adsourcing dispute resolution, it shirks its role as final arbiter.\r\n\r\nThis Article does not attempt to resolve that dilemma. Neither the delegation framework developed in Parts I and II nor the complicity-avoidance theory developed in this Part can tell us exactly how much power a civil justice system <em>should<\/em> delegate to private parties. Given all the competing imperatives, however, it does seem that our current civil justice system strikes a reasonable balance. Civil procedure\u2019s delegations realize a number of practical and moral benefits for individual litigants and the political community at large, while its delegation-policing doctrines help the political community to avoid becoming complicit in the worst forms of abuse of those delegations. One can, of course, readily envision perfectly legitimate civil justice systems that strike a different balance\u2014either delegating less state power to private parties to avoid even more complicity in private wrongdoing or delegating even more state power to better promote autonomy and accommodate pluralism. The important point is to recognize the tradeoff between complicity avoidance and other important values served by the delegation of state power. Our civil justice system accepts a significant degree of public complicity in private wrongdoing for the sake of those other values, rather than seeking to minimize any threat to the political community\u2019s moral integrity by maintaining exclusive state control over coercive state power.\r\n<h2>IV. Toward a Delegation-Policing Approach to Arbitration<\/h2>\r\nThe analytical framework developed in the previous Parts can shed light on several procedural debates, both within ordinary civil litigation and beyond it. Within ordinary civil litigation, this Article\u2019s delegation framework simultaneously highlights some of the benefits and drawbacks of current procedural practice. For example, although judges enjoy substantial discretion to police discovery abuse, there is a widespread impres\u00adsion that they rarely exercise it, with the result that discovery often ends up devolving into a \u201cfree-for-all.\u201d[footnote]Pollis, supra note 91, at 2099.[\/footnote] The delegation framework sug\u00adgests that judges can respond to such problems (insofar as they\u2019re real problems)[footnote]Cf. Danya Shocair Reda, The Cost-and-Delay Narrative in Civil Justice Reform: Its Fallacies and Functions, 90 Or. L. Rev. 1085, 1088\u201390 (2012) (arguing that the costs of discovery are exaggerated); Spencer, supra note 157, at 1730 (same).[\/footnote] by more aggressively policing discovery for abuse ex post, in contrast to the recent amendments to the discovery rules, which focus on limiting the scope of discovery ex ante.[footnote]See supra note 91 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe delegation framework also speaks to delegations of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers outside ordinary civil litigation. Such delega\u00adtions include so-called \u201ccorporate settlement mills,\u201d a practice in which corporations that have been accused of wrongdoing essentially adjudi\u00adcate victims\u2019 claims, sometimes in ways that preclude the victims from seeking relief in court.[footnote]Dana A. Remus &amp; Adam S. Zimmerman, The Corporate Settlement Mill, 101 Va. L. Rev. 129, 136\u201341 (2015) (arguing that corporate settlement mills \u201cprivatize dispute resolution nearly completely, and are subject to far weaker (if any) forms of public regulation and oversight\u201d).[\/footnote] This Article\u2019s framework confirms the many concerns that scholars have voiced about this practice and suggests the outlines of a general approach to enhancing its legitimacy.\r\n\r\nBut however important these and other procedural issues may be, the most pressing one remains arbitration. This Part accordingly revisits the delegation critique of arbitration in light of what the previous Parts have revealed about civil procedure\u2019s own delegations of state power. As section\u00a0IV.A argues, proponents of the delegation critique rightly worry that arbitration delegates significant coercive power to private parties and that, under current Supreme Court precedent, private parties can abuse that power with virtual impunity. In the end, though, the delegations of state power in arbitration are conceptually continuous with those in ordinary civil litigation; the former may lend themselves to more egre\u00adgious forms of abuse, but both sets of delegations fundamentally raise the same kinds of concerns. This continuity suggests an alternative approach to arbitration\u2019s delegation problem: adapting civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtion-policing doctrines for arbitration\u2019s delegations.\r\n\r\nSection IV.B begins to take up that task. This Article\u2019s approach focuses less on the <em>enforceability<\/em> of arbitration clauses and more on the <em>reviewability<\/em> of arbitral proceedings and awards. Whereas holding broad classes of arbitration clauses unenforceable effectively restricts private parties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to arbitration\u2019s delegations before any abuse has occurred, reviewing arbitral proceedings and awards allows courts to <em>police<\/em> those delegations for abuse after the fact\u2014the primary strategy civil procedure employs with respect to the delegations in ordinary civil litigation. There may indeed be compelling reasons to severely restrict access to arbitration\u2019s delegations ex ante. But short of that, the lesson of civil procedure\u2019s delegations is that many of the concerns about delegated state power in arbitration can be addressed by policing arbitration\u2019s delegations for abuse ex post.\r\n<h3>A. Delegating Procedure Redux<\/h3>\r\n1. <em>The Delegation Critique Defended<\/em>. \u2014 Proponents of the delegation critique tend to portray arbitration as a radical departure from ordinary civil litigation. Whereas public institutions and officials discharge the state\u2019s dispute-resolution functions in ordinary civil litigation, most scholars suppose, arbitration \u201cprivatizes\u201d or \u201coutsources\u201d many of those functions.[footnote]See supra notes 6\u20139, 31\u201333 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] We can now see that this contrast is overdrawn.[footnote]And not just because of practices such as contract procedure and court-annexed ADR. See supra notes 10, 26.[\/footnote] Ordinary civil litigation likewise delegates many of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution functions to private parties, thereby vesting them with significant coercive power.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that scholars have been wrong to worry about the delegations of state power involved in arbitration. On the contrary, those delegations raise the same basic concerns as the delegations in ordinary civil litigation. To be sure, what this Article calls the \u201cdelegation critique\u201d actually comprises a number of related, but distinct, criticisms, including the following: Binding dispute resolution is an inherently \u201cpublic function\u201d that should not be delegated to private parties except subject to strict limits,[footnote]See, e.g., Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 997\u201399; cf. Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 533 (raising similar concerns about contract procedure). Resnik\u2019s concerns about \u201cprivatization\u201d and \u201coutsourcing\u201d can also be understood in these terms.

Colo. L. Rev. 459, 501\u201302 (2014).[\/footnote] Scholars have further argued that adjudication not only resolves private disputes but also realizes a number of public goods that arbitration forgoes\u2014most notably, the production of legal precedent to guide the resolution of future cases[footnote]See, e.g., Richard M. Alderman, Consumer Arbitration: The Destruction of the Common Law, 2 J. Am. Arb. 1, 11\u201312 (2003); Myriam Gilles, The Day Doctrine Died: Private Arbitration and the End of Law, 2016 U. Ill. L.

Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 513\u201314 (raising similar concerns about contract procedure).[\/footnote] And whereas civil litigation proceeds (largely) in open court, arbitration is almost completely shielded from public scrutiny.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Access, supra note 6, at 133\u201342; Judith Resnik, Courts: In and out of Sight, Site, and Cite: The Norman Shachoy Lecture, 53 Vill.

Rev. 1101, 1137 (2006).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile it is important to recognize the differences among these various criticisms of arbitration, each ultimately presumes the kind of delegation identified in Part I. Each problem, that is, arises only because arbitration allows private parties to tap the coercive power of the state without any meaningful judicial oversight. Thus, private parties perform the inherently \u201cpublic function\u201d of dispute resolution only insofar as their decisions are <em>binding<\/em>\u2014more or less automatically backed by the coercive power of the state.[footnote]See Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 997 (arguing that, in contrast to nonbinding dispute resolution, \u201c[t]he binding resolution of disputes is, of course, a traditionally exclusive public function\u201d).[\/footnote] Private parties can use procedure to evade substantive legal obligations only insofar as courts will more or less automatically enforce their procedural choices. Privately made rules constitute \u201claw\u201d only insofar as they\u2019re coercively enforced without any real judicial review.[footnote]See Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 441, 444 (arguing that the FAA, as construed by the Supreme Court, \u201callows private parties to engage in lawmaking\u201d by \u201cmak[ing] arbitration clauses enforceable with few restrictions\u201d and \u201callow[ing] drafters to cut judges out of the loop\u201d).[\/footnote] Arbitration forgoes the public goods of precedent and transparency only insofar as private parties can authoritatively resolve their disputes unsupervised. And private parties can shield dispute reso\u00adlution from public scrutiny only insofar as their authoritative decisions are insulated from judicial review, which <em>would<\/em> be subject to public scrutiny. None of these problems would be so acute if a party to an arbitration agreement could, notwithstanding the agreement, either litigate her dispute in court or at least obtain meaningful judicial review of any arbitral award;[footnote]Before the FAA, the \u201crevocability doctrine\u201d allowed a party to an arbitration agreement to revoke the agreement and litigate her dispute in court at any time before an arbitral award was rendered. See Ian R. Macneil, American Arbitration Law: Reformation, Nationalization, Internalization 20 (1992).[\/footnote] each problem stems from the fact that the state coercively enforces arbitration without adequate scrutiny. This is the sense in which arbitration can be understood to <em>delegate<\/em> state power.[footnote]Cf. Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535 (linking the concern that contract procedure \u201cprivatiz[es],\u201d \u201coutsource[es],\u201d or \u201cdelegate[es]\u201d the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers with the concern that it forgoes various \u201cpublic goods\u201d associated with litigation).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnd the current arbitration regime does indeed pervasively delegate state power in precisely that sense. As others have recognized, the FAA, which governs the relationship between courts and arbitration, contains multiple delegations on its face.[footnote]See, e.g., Brunet, Arbitration and Constitutional Rights, supra note 9, at 109; Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 480; Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1006; Sternlight, Rethinking, supra note 9, at 42.[\/footnote] On the front end, the Act requires federal district courts, upon motion, to compel arbitration and to stay any related judicial proceedings in any dispute subject to a valid arbitration clause.[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u20134 (2012).[\/footnote] As for the arbitral proceedings themselves, the FAA authorizes the parties to choose a method for appointing an arbitrator and, by exten\u00adsion, the procedures she will follow.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a05. If the arbitration clause fails to specify a method or if the parties fail to follow the specified method, then the court may appoint an arbitrator. Id.[\/footnote] Whomever they appoint, in turn, is empowered to subpoena nonparty witnesses and documentary evidence.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07. Courts are divided over whether this provision permits arbitrators to compel prehearing \u201cdiscovery\u201d from nonparties or only the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses at an actual arbitral \u201chearing.\u201d See \u00adRandy J. Sutton, Annotation, Discovery in Federal Arbitration Proceedings, 45 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 51, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013\u201316 (2010) (collecting cases).[\/footnote] Although a subpoena issues \u201cin the name of the arbitrator\u201d and under her signature, the parties can petition a federal district court for an order compelling compliance, on pain of sanctions.[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07.[\/footnote] On the back end, if the agreement so provides, a party may seek a court order confirming any arbitral award,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a09.[\/footnote] with the order \u201chav[ing] the same force and effect, in all respects, as, and be[ing] subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in an action,\u201d such that \u201cit may be enforced as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a013.[\/footnote] The FAA thus repeatedly endows the decisions of private parties and their chosen arbitrators with the full and virtually automatic coercive backing of the state[footnote]See Richard C. Reuben, Democracy and Dispute Resolution: The Problem of Arbitration, 67 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 279, 296 (2004) (noting that arbitral awards \u201cgenerally are final, binding, and enforceable by courts, and generally may not be reversed on substantive grounds\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, in contrast to ordinary civil litigation, the FAA lacks any meaningful mechanisms for policing its delegations. In fact, the Act, as construed by the Supreme Court, affirmatively frustrates almost all judicial delegation-policing efforts, severely limiting the ability of courts to review a privately chosen arbitrator\u2019s actions before coercively enforc\u00ading them.[footnote]See Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 489\u201393; Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2810.[\/footnote] Courts generally may not scrutinize an arbitrator\u2019s subpoena for relevance or materiality before compelling compliance with it.[footnote]See, e.g., In re Sec. Life Ins. Co. of Am., 228 F.3d 865, 871 (8th Cir. 2000) (refusing to require district courts to \u201cmake an independent assessment of the materiality\u201d of information sought in a subpoena before enforcing it); Festus &amp; Helen Stacy Found., Inc. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner, &amp; Smith Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 1375, 1379\u201380 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (holding that determining the \u201crelevance of the subpoenaed materials\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. should be left to the arbitration panel\u201d). But see Oceanic Transp. Corp. of Monrovia v. Alcoa S.S. Co., 129 F. Supp. 160, 161 (S.D.N.Y. 1954) (holding that the district court had a duty to determine \u201cwhether or not the subpoenaed material would be material as evidence\u201d).[\/footnote] While the Act specifies various grounds for vacating, modifying, or correct\u00ading an arbitral award,[footnote]See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a010\u201311.[\/footnote] the Supreme Court has held that those grounds are exclusive and cannot be augmented, even by private agreement.[footnote]See Hall St. Assocs. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 584 (2008). But see Richard C. Reuben, Personal Autonomy and Vacatur After <em>Hall Street<\/em>, 113 Penn. St. L. Rev. 1103, 1110\u201316 (2009) [hereinafter Reuben, Personal Autonomy] (identifying various nonstatutory grounds for vacatur that State and lower federal courts had developed before <em>Hall Street<\/em>).[\/footnote] Each of the enumerated grounds, moreover, is quite narrow. For example, most of the grounds for vacatur require egregious abuse during the proceedings, such as fraud or corruption, that actually infects the final award.[footnote]See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(1)\u2013(3).[\/footnote] Only one of the grounds concerns the merits of the award, permitting vacatur \u201cwhere the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(4).[\/footnote] Yet, the Court has held that \u201c[i]t is not enough\u201d under this provision \u201cto show that the [arbitrator] committed an error\u2014or even a serious error\u201d;[footnote]Oxford Health Plans LLC v.

(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting E. Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers, Dist. 17, 531 U.S. 57, 62 (2000)).[\/footnote] The FAA, in short, requires federal courts to coercively enforce all but the most flagrantly abusive decisions of pri\u00advately appointed arbitrators. Given the statute\u2019s broad delegations and dearth of delegation-policing mechanisms, it seems fair to conclude along with proponents of the delegation critique that the FAA has \u201caggrandized private parties.\u201d[footnote]Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 456.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nScholars are right to worry about this state of affairs and to decry the Supreme Court\u2019s seeming nonchalance toward the FAA\u2019s broad delega\u00adtions of state power. In addition to all of the concerns raised by propo\u00adnents of the delegation critique, this Article has highlighted the risk that private parties will abuse delegations such as those in the FAA, violating important public values and potentially rendering the entire political community complicit in their wrongdoing. Perhaps we could tolerate that risk if, as in ordinary civil litigation, courts possessed meaningful mechanisms to repudiate abusive exercises of delegated power in arbitra\u00adtion. But the Supreme Court has largely eviscerated what few delegation-policing mechanisms the FAA arguably contains.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Beyond Enforceability<\/em>. \u2014 Proponents of the delegation critique have proposed to address this problem primarily by curbing arbitration\u2014essentially, limiting private parties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to the FAA\u2019s delegations of state power. They would do so in two ways. On the one hand, many scholars would have courts refuse to enforce arbitration clauses in broad catego\u00adries of disputes, particularly disputes between sophisticated parties and individual consumers or employees, mandating that such disputes be resolved exclusively through court-based adjudication.[footnote]See supra note 27 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Linda S. Mullenix, Gaming the System: Protecting Consumers from Unconscionable Contractual Forum-Selection and Arbitration Clauses, 66 Hastings L.J. 719, 756\u201360 (2015); Resnik, Privatization, supra note 6, at 1812; Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1017\u201334; Richard C. Reuben, FAA Law, Without the Activism: What If the Bellwether Cases Were Decided by a Truly Conservative Court?, 60 U. Kan. L. Rev. 883, 922\u201324 (2012). Scholars have made similar proposals for other forms of procedural private ordering, such as forum-selection clauses. See, e.g., Paul B. Carrington &amp; Paul H. Haagen, Contract and Jurisdiction, 1996 Sup. Ct. Rev. 331, 332, 351\u201361, 401; Linda S. Mullenix, Another Choice of Forum, Another Choice of Law: Consensual Adjudicatory Procedure in Federal Court, 57 Fordham L. Rev. 291, 362\u201363 (1988).[\/footnote] Because the arbi\u00adtration clauses governing such disputes almost always appear in contracts of adhesion, scholars argue that courts should either refuse to enforce adhesive arbitration clauses outright or, to similar effect, rigorously assess the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of such clauses, defining \u201cvolun\u00adtariness\u201d in a way that precludes enforcement.[footnote]See supra notes 27, 332 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] On the other hand, some scholars would have courts enforce only those arbitration clauses that provide for arbitration proceedings that closely mirror ordinary civil litigation.[footnote]See supra note 28 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2811, 2921; Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 600; Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1046\u2013101; Teresa J. Verges, Evolution of the Arbitration Forum as a Response to Mandatory Arbitration, 18 Nev. L.J. (forthcoming 2018) (manuscript at 5, 18\u201319, 22) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); cf. Sarah Rudolph Cole &amp; E. Gary Spitko, Arbitration and the <em>Batson<\/em> Principle, 38 Ga. L. Rev. 1145, 1147\u201351 (2004) (considering the extension of civil <em>Batson<\/em> to arbitration); Paul R. Verkuil, Privatizing Due Process, 57 Admin. L. Rev. 963, 983\u201386 (2005) (arguing that arbitration should be shaped by due process values).[\/footnote] Arbitration, on this view, would be much less disconcerting if it resembled the proverbial \u201cday in court,\u201d with ample discovery, an impartial adjudicator, and ade\u00adquate remedies. To be sure, some of these same scholars simultaneously advocate enhanced judicial review of arbitral awards and proceedings\u2014but only as part of a belt-and-suspenders approach rather than as a distinct strategy.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2811 (advocating \u201coversight on both process and outcomes ex post\u201d alongside various ex ante restrictions on enforceability); Stone, Rustic Justice, supra note 7, at 1025\u201328 (advocating due process protections, heightened review, and reinstatement of the revocability doctrine).[\/footnote] And they ultimately put more weight on limiting the enforce\u00adment of arbitration clauses, as opposed to more closely scrutinizing the outputs of arbitration proceedings.[footnote]See, e.g., Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 493\u201396 (calling for greater judicial review of arbitration but emphasizing review of arbitration clauses as part of the enforceability and arbitrability analyses, rather than review of arbitral awards and proceedings as part of the vacatur and confirmation analyses). Scholars have recently begun to address these kinds of proposals to administrative agencies as well as courts. See, e.g., Daniel T. Deacon, Agencies and Arbitration, 117 Colum. L. Rev. 991, 993\u201394 (2017) (advocating greater administrative regulation of arbitration); David L. Noll, Regulating Arbitration, 105 Calif. L. Rev. 985, 1031\u201333 (2017) (same). But see Zachary D. Clopton, Class Actions and Executive Power, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 878, 884, 887 (2017) (identifying drawbacks of an administrative approach).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis emphasis on the enforceability of arbitration clauses is under\u00adstandable as a practical matter. For at least as currently construed by the Supreme Court, the FAA gives courts somewhat more leeway to keep disputes out of arbitration in the first place than to reassert control over them once they\u2019ve been shunted there\u2014either by deeming an arbitration clause unenforceable under State and federal law doctrines preserved by the Act\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02 (2012). The Court has, however, significantly cabined the savings clause, interpreting \u00a7\u00a02 to preempt a number of State law doctrines, and to displace a number of federal law doctrines, that would keep more categories of disputes in court. See, e.g., Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 133 S. Ct. 2304, 2310\u201311 (2013) (declining to apply the federal effective-vindication doctrine); AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 346 (2011) (finding that California\u2019s unconscionability doctrine \u201cinterferes with arbitration\u201d).[\/footnote] or as part of determining whether the parties actually agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute (the so-called arbitrability determination).[footnote]See Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 443\u201345 (2006) (discussing arbitrability). Unless, that is, the parties agreed to delegate that determination to the arbitrator. See Rent-A-Center, W., Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 78 (2010) (allowing parties to delegate the arbitrability determination to arbitrators). For a critical overview of such \u201cdelegation clauses,\u201d see generally David Horton, Arbitration About Arbitration, 70 Stan. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2018) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nScholars have also adduced deeply principled reasons for restricting access to arbitration\u2019s delegations in broad categories of cases. First, sophisticated parties, such as corporations, frequently insert arbitration clauses into contracts of adhesion with ordinary individuals, a practice that, many believe, allows them to exploit the FAA\u2019s delegations to effectively force individuals to relinquish their right to their \u201cday in court\u201d for a one-sided arbitration proceeding.[footnote]See, e.g., Radin, Fine Print, supra note 8, at 19\u201332; Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 486\u201389; Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2808, 2839\u201340, 2863\u201374; see also Linda J. Demaine &amp; Deborah R. Hensler, \u201cVolunteering\u201d to Arbitrate Through Predispute Arbitration Clauses: The Average Consumer\u2019s Experience, 67 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 55, 72\u201374 (2004); Knapp, supra note 308, at 788\u201389; David S. Schwartz, Mandatory Arbitration and Fairness, 84 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1247, 1249 (2009); Sternlight, Mandatory Arbitration, supra note 27, at 1648\u201353. Scholars have criticized other forms of procedural private ordering on similar grounds. See, e.g., Taylor &amp; Cliffe, supra note 10, at 1105.[\/footnote] Many have argued that the FAA was never intended to apply to such contracts but only to contracts between sophisticated commercial parties.[footnote]See, e.g., Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 124 (2001) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Imre Szalai, Outsourcing Justice: The Rise of Modern Arbitration Laws in America 188\u201389 (2013); Christopher R. Leslie, The Arbitration Bootstrap, 94 Tex. L. Rev. 265, 300\u201320 (2015). Many proponents of the delegation critique sympathize with this argument, see, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2836\u201338, though their concerns about \u201cprivatization\u201d and \u201coutsourcing\u201d do not depend on it.[\/footnote] The exploitative nature of these agreements is exemplified for many scholars by arbitra\u00adtion clauses that forbid class arbitration even in so-called negative-value cases, in which the costs of prosecuting the case on an individual basis (either in arbitration or a lawsuit) exceed any potential recovery.[footnote]For a cogent indictment of class-arbitration bans, see <em>Italian Colors<\/em>, 133 S. Ct. at 2313\u201320 (Kagan, J., dissenting); see also, e.g., Myriam Gilles &amp; Gary Friedman, After Class: Aggregate Litigation in the Wake of <em>AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion<\/em>, 79 U. Chi. L. Rev. 623, 628\u201329 (2012).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, whereas most scholars tend to view arbitration\u2019s delegations as differing from civil procedure\u2019s in kind, this Article has essentially argued that the two differ in degree; arbitration and ordinary civil litigation may differ in the <em>extent <\/em>to which each delegates state power, but they do not differ in the <em>fact<\/em> that each delegates state power. Even accepting that characterization, however, one might think that the differ\u00adence in degree makes all the difference. Civil procedure delegates various procedural powers piecemeal while retaining as the final decisionmaker a public official who is constrained by both substantive law and procedural rules and who must give public reasons for her decisions; arbitration, by contrast, authorizes private parties to assign the state\u2019s dispute-resolution function wholesale to a private decisionmaker.\r\n\r\nBoth sets of concerns have a lot of merit, but they have been fully aired in the literature, as have the resulting proposals to dramatically curtail arbitration.[footnote]See supra notes 6\u20139, 339 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Notwithstanding the extensive scholarly criticism, the Supreme Court has steadfastly adhered to its decades-old jurispru\u00addence upholding the enforceability of adhesive arbitration clauses against individual consumers and employees.[footnote]Cf. Markovits, supra note 153, at 487 (\u201cArbitration\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is here to stay.\u201d).[\/footnote] What proponents of the delega\u00adtion critique have missed is that civil procedure contains the seeds of another kind of response to arbitration\u2019s delegation problem, one with its own, distinct logic. Even if courts continue to enforce arbitration clauses that many scholars consider problematic, we should empower courts to repudiate the abuses of delegated state power that occur during arbitration after the fact.\r\n\r\nA delegation-policing approach holds promise notwithstanding the significant differences between arbitration and ordinary civil litigation. The power asymmetries between the parties do indeed tend to be more pronounced in arbitration than in civil litigation, and arbitration involves the wholesale delegation of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers to privately chosen arbitrators, in contrast to the piecemeal delegations in civil litigation. In light of all this, many scholars worry that sophisticated parties can use arbitration to effectively suppress legal claims, making arbitral proceedings so one-sided that no victim of wrongdoing would bother to invoke them to seek redress.[footnote]See supra note 8 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Resnik, Access, supra note 6, at 143\u201354 (reporting empirical findings that individual consumers rarely use arbitration).[\/footnote] But adopting delegation-policing doctrines might still go at least some way toward addressing this concern. If courts reviewed arbitral awards and proceedings more rigorously before enforcing the awards\u2014if arbitration\u2019s delegations were better policed\u2014the prospect of such review might have a feedback effect of rendering those processes less one-sided in many cases. It might then become more worthwhile for would-be plaintiffs to actually go through with an arbitration when their claims were subject to a valid arbitration clause. Greater policing ex post, in short, might help to make arbitration fairer ex ante.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, such ex post delegation-policing strategies may be insuf\u00adficient to resolve some of the biggest controversies surrounding arbitra\u00adtion. It may be impossible, for example, to address the problems posed by class-arbitration bans without prohibiting them ex ante. Nonetheless, we can combat a significant amount of abuse by having courts police arbitration ex post, through analogues of civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines.\r\n<h3>B. Policing Arbitration\u2019s Delegations<\/h3>\r\nThis section begins to think about how we might recast civil proce\u00addure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines to fit arbitration\u2019s delegations of state power. Given the magnitude of the task, the doctrinal proposals outlined here are necessarily impressionistic. This section aims only to give a gen\u00aderal sense of what a delegation-policing approach to arbitration might look like rather than to develop a comprehensive program for reform. In doing so, however, this section attempts to illustrate how we can look to civil procedure to allay some of the concerns about arbitration.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Rescinding Delegations<\/em>. \u2014 The FAA currently contains no cognates of the doctrines in civil procedure that rescind delegated state powers when they\u2019re being abused. It seems, however, that such doctrines could play a salutary role in arbitration too. One possibility would be to amend the FAA to provide for interlocutory judicial review of certain procedural decisions made during an arbitration and for the termination of the arbitration if a court determined that any of those decisions were abu\u00adsive.[footnote]It is important to distinguish this proposed review from interlocutory appellate review of district court decisions regarding arbitration. The FAA already provides for such appeals, though only from district court decisions refusing to enforce an arbitration clause. Compare 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a016(a)(1)(B) (2012) (permitting interlocutory appeals from district court refusals to compel arbitration), with id. \u00a7\u00a016(b)(2) (forbidding most interlocutory appeals from district court orders compelling arbitration).[\/footnote] The proposal might work as follows. Unless an arbitration clause was exploitative on its face, a court would compel arbitration upon the defendant\u2019s request and stay any related judicial proceedings initiated by the plaintiff. But the plaintiff would be allowed to return to court during the course of the arbitration to challenge some of the arbitrator\u2019s procedural decisions. If the court agreed with the plaintiff that the arbitrator had abused her delegated powers in making those decisions, it would discontinue the arbitration and lift the stay on the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit, thereby reasserting state control over delegated dispute-resolution powers.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would help to address some of the procedural deficiencies in arbitration identified by proponents of the delegation critique. As noted earlier, scholars have faulted arbitration for all too frequently denying plaintiffs the kinds of procedural protections they would enjoy in ordinary civil litigation, particularly a meaningful opportunity to obtain discovery and present evidence.[footnote]See supra notes 28, 334 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] When an arbitrator denies those opportunities, and when the plaintiff can\u2019t make her case without them, a court could deem the arbitrator\u2019s decision an abuse of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers and reassert state authority over the dispute. The bar for what constitutes \u201cabuse\u201d would, of course, have to be set quite high. It would not be sufficient for a plaintiff simply to disagree with an arbitrator\u2019s determination that, say, a particular document wasn\u2019t discoverable or the testimony of a particular witness was cumulative. But it seems reasonable to rescind delegated state powers from an arbitrator whose procedural decisions clearly thwart a fair resolution of the dispute.[footnote]The FAA does already authorize federal courts to vacate a final arbitral award when the arbitrator \u201crefus[ed] to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(3). But courts have interpreted this provision narrowly. See, e.g., La. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. ex rel. Coastal Prot. Restoration Auth. v. FEMA, No. 17-30140, 2018 WL 611215, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 29, 2018) (noting that vacatur under \u00a7\u00a010(a)(3) is permitted only in \u201cvery unusual circumstances\u201d). And in any case, a party shouldn\u2019t have to await a final award before being able to challenge egregious abuse by an arbitrator.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis proposal prompts an obvious objection: Permitting interlocu\u00adtory judicial review of arbitrators\u2019 procedural decisions would invite a flood of piecemeal appeals, which would undermine the benefits of arbitration and burden the courts. This problem could be substantially ameliorated, however, by making interlocutory review discretionary with the court rather than as of right,[footnote]Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) (authorizing discretionary interlocutory appeals from class-certification decisions).[\/footnote] and limiting such review to just a few key pro\u00adcedural decisions, such as the decisions whether to permit discovery and the presentation of evidence. And courts could further discourage abuse of the interlocutory-review mechanism by imposing sanctions for review petitions that did not even plausibly allege an abuse of delegated power.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Withholding Enforcement<\/em>. \u2014 The FAA already contains a few provi\u00adsions that, properly construed, could provide a basis for implementing a strategy of withholding coercive enforcement from abusive exercises of delegated power in arbitration. For one, the FAA authorizes federal district courts to compel compliance with an arbitrator\u2019s subpoena of a nonparty witness.[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07.[\/footnote] Although courts tend to rubber-stamp arbitral subpoenas,[footnote]See supra note 324 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] one could imagine a regime in which judges scrutinized the subpoenas more closely and refused to compel compliance with those that abuse the state\u2019s investigatory powers.\r\n\r\nFor another, the Supreme Court could overturn its precedents nar\u00adrowly interpreting the provisions of the FAA governing the confirma\u00adtion, vacatur, and modification of final arbitral awards and permit closer judicial review of such awards (though given its current composition, the Court is unlikely to change course anytime soon).[footnote]See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09\u201311 (specifying the procedures for confirmation, vacatur, correction, and modification of an arbitral award); Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2882 (lamenting that the Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly stipulated the adequacy of arbitrations and rejected judicial monitoring of the outcomes\u201d).[\/footnote] Courts would not, of course, review arbitral awards de novo but would instead apply something more akin to the deferential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard for judicial review of the decisions of administrative agencies.[footnote]The model would be the more deferential variant of arbitrary and capricious review. But cf. Richard A. Nagareda, Turning from Tort to Administration, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 899, 903 (1996) (advocating \u201chard look\u201d review of class action settlements in mass-tort cases). Instituting even such limited review, however, would at the very least require overruling the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(4). See supra notes 327\u2013330 and accompanying text. Some State and lower federal courts appear to hold out the possibility of arbitrary and capricious review for arbitral awards, but such \u201cclaims almost always fail.\u201d Reuben, Personal Autonomy, supra note 326, at 1115. Another alternative would be to expand some courts\u2019 practice of reviewing arbitral awards for a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d see id. at 1110\u201313, though understanding that standard to restrict arbitrators\u2019 discretion more than it currently does, see id. at 1111 (noting that \u201cfew\u201d courts actually set aside arbitral awards for manifest disregard).[\/footnote] While many scholars have advocated greater judicial scrutiny of arbitral awards, this Article\u2019s delegation framework grounds that proposal in a distinct logic rather than seeing it as just another way to curb arbitration.\r\n\r\nBolstering judicial review would go some way toward addressing a significant concern with arbitration: that most arbitrators are biased in favor of the repeat players that pay their fees and generate most of their business.[footnote]See, e.g., Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1064\u201367 (describing the \u201crepeat player phenomenon\u201d); Schwartz, Claim-Suppressing Arbitration, supra note 306, at 248 (\u201c[T]he system of arbitration as a structural matter creates financial incentives to decide questions of arbitrator jurisdiction (\u2018who decides\u2019) and even merits issues favorably toward those who pay them.\u201d); Jessica Silver-Greenberg &amp; Michael Corkery, In Arbitration, a \u2018Privatization of the Justice System,\u2019 N.Y. Times (Nov. 1, 2015), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/02\/business\/dealbook\/in-arbitration-a-privatization-of-the-justice-system.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (citing records showing that \u201c41 arbitrators each handled 10 or more cases for one company between 2010 and 2014\u201d).[\/footnote] The Constitution requires an impartial arbitrator.[footnote]Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., 393 U.S. 145, 150 (1968).[\/footnote] But this requirement confronts a well-recognized dilemma: If a repeat-player defendant pays an arbitrator\u2019s fees, the arbitrator may be incentivized to rule for the defendant, in the hope that it will continue to send disputes her way; yet a defendant can\u2019t require an individual plaintiff to pay all of the arbitrator\u2019s (considerable) fees, lest it effectively foreclose all relief. Notwithstanding this dilemma, scholars have argued that courts should refuse to enforce arbitration clauses that create even the potential for subtle forms of bias.[footnote]See, e.g., Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1062\u201367 (calling for inquiries into \u201cpassive bias\u201d and \u201cstructural bias\u201d).[\/footnote] Under a delegation-policing approach, by contrast, a court would review an arbitral award for arbitrariness or capriciousness. While that standard would still afford arbitrators significant discretion, it would filter out those proceedings in which the arbitrator was actually biased and the bias infected the award by prompting the arbitrator to rule based on partiality for the defendant rather than any legal or contractual ground.[footnote]Cf. Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 349\u201350 (1980) (holding that, to prove a violation of the right to conflict-free counsel, a defendant must show \u201cthat his counsel actively represented conflicting interests\u201d).[\/footnote] The prospect of such review, moreover, could potentially deter many forms of bias. This proposal could be grounded in the provision of the FAA permitting vacatur based on \u201cevident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,\u201d[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(2).[\/footnote] but understanding \u201cpartiality\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d more capaciously than courts currently do.[footnote]See, e.g., Positive Software Sols., Inc. v. New Century Mortg. Corp., 476 F.3d 278, 283 (5th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (\u201c[I]n nondisclosure cases, an award may not be vacated because of a trivial or insubstantial prior relationship between the arbitrator and the parties to the proceeding.\u201d).[\/footnote] That broader conception seems justified once one recognizes that arbitrators are vested with significant state power and therefore have a responsibility to exer\u00adcise that power consistent with important public values.\r\n\r\nOne practical hurdle this proposal would have to surmount is that there is no right to a reasoned opinion in arbitration, and arbitrators rarely provide one (though sometimes a transcript of the arbitrator\u2019s decision is available).[footnote]See Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1082\u201391 (canvassing arguments for and against reasoned opinions but recognizing that there is no constitu\u00adtional right to a reasoned opinion).[\/footnote] The lack of a reasoned opinion could frustrate judicial review in many cases, preventing a party from proving that the arbitrator or other party abused delegated state power. Short of requiring reasoned opinions in all arbitrations, courts could impose a \u201cpenalty default\u201d[footnote]Cf. Ian Ayres &amp; Robert Gertner, Filling Gaps in Incomplete Contracts: An Economic Theory of Default Rules, 99 Yale L.J. 87, 91 (1989) (defining a \u201cpenalty default\u201d as a default rule that is \u201cpurposefully set at what the parties would not want\u2014in order to encourage the parties to reveal information to each other or to third parties (especially the courts)\u201d).[\/footnote] in the absence of such an opinion, shifting the burden to the party seeking confirmation or opposing vacatur to prove that the alleged abuse of delegated power did <em>not<\/em> in fact occur. This would likely have the effect of incentivizing parties to require their chosen arbitrators to prepare reasoned opinions, just as expanded judicial review in general would likely incentivize arbitrators to exercise their powers more dispassionately.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Punishing Abuse<\/em>. \u2014 Finally, courts could punish abuse of delegated state power during arbitration by imposing sanctions during actions to confirm arbitral awards. The standard for imposing sanctions would resemble Rule 11\u2019s \u201cimproper purpose\u201d standard.[footnote]See supra notes 209\u2013211 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] According to such a standard, sanctions would be warranted when one party sought to confirm an arbitral award that issued from severely defective proceedings or sought confirmation after having forced the other party into arbitration for some illegitimate reason, such as to deprive her of an effective remedy for her injuries.[footnote]Cf. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 595 (1991) (considering, in assessing a forum-selection clause for \u201cfundamental fairness,\u201d whether the defendant included the clause with the \u201cbad-faith motive\u201d of \u201cdiscouraging [plaintiffs] from pursuing legitimate claims\u201d).[\/footnote] Courts could impose sanctions under either Rule 11 itself or their inherent powers.[footnote]See supra note 214 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] States could also create a cause of action for \u201cabuse of arbitral process,\u201d lying against the party who compelled the arbitration or the arbitrator herself, depending on who was ultimately respon\u00adsible for the abuse.[footnote]Creating a cause of action against arbitrators would require overturning decisions cloaking them in absolute judicial immunity. See, e.g., Austern v. Chi. Bd. Options Exch., Inc., 898 F.2d 882, 886 (2d Cir. 1990). See generally Maureen A. Weston, Reexamining Arbitral Immunity in an Age of Mandatory and Professional Arbitration, 88 Minn. L. Rev. 449 (2004) (arguing that arbitrators should enjoy only qualified, not absolute, immunity).[\/footnote] By punishing abuse of arbitra\u00adtion\u2019s delega\u00adtions, the state would not only repudiate the abuse but also incentivize private parties and arbitrators to design and conduct arbitra\u00adtions in accordance with important public values.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *<\/p>\r\nThe foregoing proposals are not without their problems.[footnote]So long as they were limited to purely domestic arbitrations, none of the proposals would put the United States in violation of its obligations under the New York Convention, which governs the enforcement of <em>foreign<\/em> arbitral awards. See Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention), June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2157, 330 U.N.T.S. 38; see also 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0201\u2013208 (2012) (prescribing procedures for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in federal court). This Article does not address the distinct issues presented by international arbitration.[\/footnote] Those who are skeptical of arbitration will likely worry that the various dele\u00adgation-policing strategies, with their reliance on ex post judicial review, would prove too burdensome for the parties they\u2019re primarily designed to help\u2014namely, individuals seeking redress against sophisticated parties. Yet while plaintiffs and plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may currently have inadequate incentives to challenge arbitral awards and procedures, the calculus would be different if the delegation-policing strategies outlined above were adopted. Indeed, with stronger delegation-policing doctrines, it might even be <em>easier<\/em> to challenge arbitral awards and procedures after the fact than to oppose sending a dispute to arbitration in the first place. That\u2019s because the primary legal bases for resisting the enforcement of an arbitration clause\u2014the State contract law doctrines of public policy and unconscionability and the federal effective-vindication doctrine[footnote]See supra note 337.[\/footnote]\u2014all turn on speculative inquiries about the likely conduct of the arbitra\u00adtion proceedings in a given case or set of cases, whereas the delegation-policing doctrines respond to abuse that has already occurred.\r\n\r\nSupporters of arbitration, on the other hand, will likely worry that the delegation-policing strategies would threaten to vitiate many of arbitra\u00adtion\u2019s purported benefits, such as finality, informality, and speed.[footnote]See, e.g., Lisa Bernstein, Understanding the Limits of Court-Connected ADR: A Critique of Federal Court-Annexed Arbitration Programs, 141 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2169, 2240\u201341, 2243 (1993); see also Hall St. Assocs. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 588 (2008) (explaining that limiting judicial review \u201cmaintain[s] arbitration\u2019s essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway,\u201d whereas permitting \u201cfull-bore legal and evidentiary appeals\u201d would render arbitration \u201cmerely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc., 341 F.3d 987, 998 (9th Cir. 2003))).[\/footnote] Some scholars have suggested that these benefits are exaggerated, as arbi\u00adtration has increasingly come to resemble litigation.[footnote]See, e.g., Edward Brunet, Replacing Folklore Arbitration with a Contract Model of Arbitration, 74 Tul. L. Rev. 39, 52\u201361 (1999) (arguing that the rules of the major arbitration organizations have become highly judicialized); Thomas J. Stipanowich, Arbitration: The \u201cNew Litigation,\u201d 2010 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1, 11\u201320 (2010) (arguing that arbitration increasingly employs litigation-like procedures, including discovery and hearings).[\/footnote] But whatever the merits of that debate, the delegation-policing approach advocated here would likely undermine arbitration primarily in one-off disputes between unequal parties\u2014precisely the kinds of disputes in which arbitration is most likely to involve abuse. For the weaker party in such disputes would have little reason not to invoke the delegation-policing doctrines. In disputes between sophisticated parties, by contrast, the parties would be more likely to have an ongoing relationship and thus would be more loath to invoke the delegation-policing doctrines, lest they undermine the efficiency advantages of arbitration for their future disputes.[footnote]Cf. Lisa Bernstein, Merchant Law in a Merchant Court: Rethinking the Code\u2019s Search for Immanent Business Norms, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1765, 1796 (1996) (identifying \u201cnorms that transactors follow in attempting to cooperatively resolve disputes in a manner that will not jeopardize future dealings\u201d); Stone, Rustic Justice, supra note 7, at 1024\u201330 (arguing that arbitration is most appropriate for disputes between the members of \u201cself-regulating normative communities\u201d).[\/footnote] It is also worth reemphasizing that, in any kind of dispute, the standard for showing an abuse of delegated power would be a strict one, such that the majority of arbitral decisions would in practice be final. In the end, though, we inevitably face a tradeoff between benefits to private parties and costs to public values whenever we delegate state power. A delegation-policing approach better accounts for both the benefits and the costs of arbitration\u2019s delegations than does the current regime.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nFor solutions to some of the most vexing problems with arbitration, we should look to civil procedure. Scholars have rightly worried that arbitration delegates state power to private parties. What they\u2019ve missed, however, is that a similar delegation problem has already been rehearsed in ordinary civil litigation. One of the most distinctive features of the American civil justice system is that it allows private parties to exercise significant coercive power without prior judicial approval; it is a relatively small step to conceptualize those private exercises of power as delega\u00adtions of state power. Responding to the potential for its delegations to be abused, civil procedure contains numerous doctrines that, rather than restrict access to delegated power before any abuse has occurred, allow the state to distance itself after the fact from exercises of delegated power that offend especially important public values. Civil procedure has even articulated a normative rationale for these delegation-policing doctrines: the need for the state (and the political community it serves) to avoid complicity in private wrongdoing. So the fundamental problem with arbi\u00adtration isn\u2019t that it delegates state power per se, but that it lacks the kinds of delegation-policing doctrines found throughout civil procedure. Once we grasp this major flaw in the current arbitration regime, we can move beyond the dichotomy between permitting private parties to abuse arbitration\u2019s delegations with virtual impunity, as current doctrine does, and putting strict ex ante limits on those delegations, as most critics of arbitration advocate. Even if arbitration clauses continue to be enforced more often than arbitration\u2019s critics think legitimate, we can still address many of the concerns about arbitration by expanding judicial review of arbitral awards and proceedings to enable courts to police arbitration\u2019s delegations, just as they already police civil procedure\u2019s.\r\n\r\nWhy have scholars overlooked this deep continuity between arbitra\u00adtion and ordinary civil litigation? This Article concludes by venturing a possible diagnosis and a prescription.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is the near monopoly procedural due process enjoys on normative questions in civil procedure. An analytical framework that is self-consciously preoccupied with the procedures of <em>state institutions<\/em> is bound to neglect crucial issues when we\u2019re assessing the exercise of coer\u00adcive power by <em>private parties<\/em>. Notwithstanding this blind spot, scholars continue to analyze procedural questions primarily in due process terms.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 663\u201364 (\u201cContract Procedure requires some oversight, through the lens of Due Process Procedure, because court-based decisionmaking entails opportunities to be heard.\u201d); see also supra notes 28, 334 and accompanying text (advocating the extension of due process norms to arbitration).[\/footnote] That approach will prove at best incomplete, eliding important issues raised by the privatization of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers. For the same reasons, procedural due process also glosses over core fea\u00adtures of ordinary civil litigation, which casts the state in a supporting role as often as a leading one.\r\n\r\nThe prescription, as this Article has sought to demonstrate, is a greater focus in civil procedure scholarship on liberal political theory and its account of political power. Scholars commonly turn to liberal political theory to understand other areas of the law, particularly consti\u00adtutional law[footnote]See, e.g., Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Legitimacy and the Constitution, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1787, 1796\u20131801 (2005) (discussing \u201cmoral and political legitimacy\u201d as an aspect of \u201cconstitutional legitimacy\u201d); Richard H. Pildes, Why Rights Are Not Trumps: Social Meanings, Expressive Harms, and Constitutionalism, 27 J. Legal Stud. 725, 726 (1998) (exploring the connections between constitutional law and theories of rights).[\/footnote] and criminal law.[footnote]See, e.g., George P. Fletcher, The Nature and Function of Criminal Theory, 88 Calif. L. Rev. 687, 700 (2000) (\u201cThis is fairly good proof that criminal theory seems to function today as a potpourri of political theory.\u201d); V.F. Nourse, Reconceptualizing Criminal Law Defenses, 151 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1691, 1703\u201326 (2003) (analyzing criminal law defenses in terms of political theory).[\/footnote] And it has even made some significant inroads into civil procedure, as scholars have invoked liberal-democratic values to justify various aspects of civil litigation.[footnote]For a recent example, see generally Alexandra Lahav, In Praise of Litigation (2017). Under the early influence of Lea Brilmayer, personal-jurisdiction scholarship has also incorporated many insights from political theory. See, e.g., Lea Brilmayer, Liberalism, Community, and State Borders, 41 Duke L.J. 1, 1 (1991) (analyzing personal jurisdiction in terms of political theory); George A. Rutherglen, Personal Jurisdiction and Political Authority (Va. Pub. Law &amp; Legal Theory Research Paper No. 2017-13, 2017) (same), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2951109 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). And Martin Redish has criticized the contemporary class action from a similar perspective. See generally Martin H. Redish, Wholesale Justice: Constitutional Democracy and the Problem of the Class Action Lawsuit (2009).[\/footnote] But liberal political theory\u2019s account of political power has been virtually absent from debates about the privatization of civil justice. That is unfortunate. Civil proce\u00addure is one of the primary ways political power gets exercised in our society. As such, it raises all the same questions that attend the exercise of political power in any other institutional setting\u2014the boundary between public and private foremost among them. At the same time, civil proce\u00addure inflects these age-old questions with its unique division of labor between private parties and state officials. Liberal political theory can thus help us to more fruitfully conceptualize some of the problems with recent procedural trends, as well as to more readily apprehend the solutions our civil justice system already has to offer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

One of the most significant developments in civil justice during the last few decades has been the mass exodus of private disputes from public courts to private forms of dispute resolution, particularly arbitra\u00adtion.[footnote]For an overview of the controversy surrounding consumer arbitration, as well as empirical findings confirming its significance, see generally David Horton &amp; Andrea Cann Chandrasekher, After the Revolution: An Empirical Study of Consumer Arbitration, 104 Geo.

Scholars have leveled similar criticisms against other forms of \u201cprocedural private ordering,\u201d see Jaime Dodge, The Limits of Procedural Private Ordering, 97 Va. L. Rev. 723, 728 (2011), particularly \u201ccontract procedure\u201d\u2014contractual provisions that purport to alter the procedural rules that generally govern the resolution of private disputes in public courts. The most prominent example is Kevin E. Davis and Helen Hershkoff\u2019s article, which criticizes contract procedure as a form of (interchangeably) \u201cprivatization,\u201d \u201coutsourcing,\u201d and \u201cdelegation,\u201d and connects that concern to the worry that contract procedure forgoes various \u201cpublic goods\u201d associated with adjudication. Kevin E. Davis &amp; Helen Hershkoff, Contracting for Procedure, 53 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 507, 512\u201313 (2011). For another example, see David H. Taylor &amp; Sara M. Cliffe, Civil Procedure by Contract: A Convoluted Confluence of Private Contract and Public Procedure in Need of Congressional Control, 35 U. Rich. L. Rev. 1085, 1087 (2002) (discussing predispute procedural agreements and courts\u2019 role in enforcing them). These criticisms apply to arbitration a fortiori.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile largely accepting the main thrust of the delegation critique, this Article challenges one of its key assumptions, with implications both for our understanding of civil procedure and for our policies toward arbi\u00adtration. Scholars have rightly worried that the current arbitration regime delegates significant coercive power to private parties and that the Supreme Court has construed the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) so as to deny courts adequate authority to review arbitral proceedings and awards.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.1. For one example, see Hall St. Assocs. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586\u201388 (2008) (holding that courts may not expand the grounds for modifying or vacating an arbitral award beyond those provided in the FAA, even with the agreement of the parties).[\/footnote] The result is a system in which private parties and their chosen arbitrators enjoy wide latitude to abuse delegated state power, violating important public values in the process. Yet proponents of the delegation critique tend to assume that civil procedure, in contrast to arbitration, vests state power largely with state officials and institutions.[footnote]See infra notes 31\u201333 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] In fact, this Article shows, civil procedure has already worked through its own delega\u00adtion problem. Drawing on liberal political theory, this Article contends that broad delegations of state power are ubiquitous in ordinary civil lit\u00adigation too. With these delegations comes the potential for abuse. Rather than limit private parties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to its delegations before any abuse has occurred, civil procedure primarily relies on a wide array of doctrines to <em>police<\/em> the delegations for abuse after the fact.[footnote]Much obviously turns on the meaning of the terms \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201cabuse.\u201d This Article elaborates on both at infra Part II.[\/footnote] These delegation-policing doctrines enable the state to withhold or withdraw its support from exer\u00adcises of delegated power that offend especially important pub\u00adlic values. In revealing the extent of the delegations in ordinary civil liti\u00adgation and examining civil procedure\u2019s strategies for policing them, this Article develops a novel theoretical account of civil procedure. It then uses that account to show how we might adapt civil procedure\u2019s delegation-polic\u00ading doctrines for arbitration. Civil procedure, this Article suggests, already contains the necessary conceptual and normative resources to address many of the problems with the current arbitration regime.\r\n\r\nThe claim that ordinary civil litigation pervasively delegates state power conflicts with commonly held impressions of our civil justice sys\u00adtem.[footnote]See, e.g., Zachary D. Clopton, Redundant Public-Private Enforcement, 69 Vand. L. Rev. 285, 323 (2016) [hereinafter Clopton, Redundant] (\u201cCourts actively supervise litigants and attorneys\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Scott Dodson, Party Subordinance in Federal Litigation, 83 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1, 20 (2014) (asserting that the circumstances in which litigants can act free from judicial oversight are \u201crelatively rare and quite narrow\u201d).[\/footnote] In fact, civil litigation is a public institution administered largely by private parties. It is public, of course, in that it proceeds under the auspices of state bodies (that is, courts), subject to the ultimate decision\u00admaking authority of state officials (that is, judges). At the same time, however, our civil justice system delegates significant coercive power to private par\u00adties. Private parties decide whether to hale others into court; they deter\u00admine which documents to demand and whom to depose during dis\u00adcovery; and they often end up rendering binding dispositions of ongoing lawsuits by deciding whether to settle a case and on what terms.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] Many times judges lack formal authority to preempt parties\u2019 decisions on these matters. Even when judges do have such authority, their hands often remain tied, at least initially, as a practical matter.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] In many other legal systems, state officials closely control the investigation and prosecution of civil cases.[footnote]On the greater involvement of state officials at all stages of civil litigation in civil law systems, see generally Mirjan R. Dama\u0161ka, The Faces of Justice and State Authority: A Comparative Approach to the Legal Process (1986); Kuo-Chang Huang, Introducing Discovery into Civil Law 37\u2013103 (2003).[\/footnote] So too in our own criminal justice system, the investigatory and prosecutorial functions are largely the province of state police offi\u00adcers and prosecutors. One of the hallmarks of our civil justice system, by contrast, is that it assigns these and other powers to private parties rather than state officials.[footnote]While other scholars have not completely ignored civil procedure\u2019s various dele\u00adgations, they have tended to view the delegations in isolation from one another rather than as manifestations of a single phenomenon. For example, Richard Nagareda depicted the power of class counsel to negotiate class action settlements as a delegation of lawmaking power without analyzing the problem of delegation in civil procedure more generally. See Richard A. Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the Structure of the Class Action, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 149, 191\u201398 (2003). More recently, Seth Davis has argued that, in certain cases, standing doctrine delegates to private parties the power to \u201cenforce the law.\u201d See Seth Davis, Standing Doctrine\u2019s State Action Problem, 91 Notre Dame L. Rev. 585, 600\u201307 (2015). But in contrast to this Article, Davis denies that the delegation extends to ordinary private lawsuits and does not consider other state powers that civil procedure delegates to private parties. See id. Davis\u2019s argument is discussed further below. See infra notes 68\u201375 and accompanying text. Along with comparativists and legal historians such as John Langbein, Stephen Yeazell has probably come the closest to offering a systematic account of the private exercise of power in civil litigation, though not the kind of theoretical framework developed in this Article. Yeazell\u2019s work is discussed throughout Part I, infra.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs public law scholars have recognized, delegating state power to private parties creates a risk that the power will be abused.[footnote]See infra note 140 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] The same risk exists in civil litigation, though the abuse assumes a different form in civil procedure than it does in the public law contexts on which scholars have primarily focused. While civil procedure generally abides a signifi\u00adcant amount of abuse in the name of \u201clitigant autonomy\u201d and other com\u00adpeting values, it sometimes deems an exercise of delegated power too objection\u00adable to tolerate. This Article shows that numerous procedural doctrines traditionally regarded as unrelated to one another actually per\u00adform the same general function of policing civil procedure\u2019s delegations for the most egregious forms of abuse.\r\n\r\nThose doctrines perform this policing function using several differ\u00adent strategies, which can be arrayed along a spectrum according to how much they interfere with private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated power. At one extreme, some doctrines <em>rescind<\/em> the delegation, putting state power back in the hands of state officials. Examples of this strategy include the appoint\u00adment of special masters to oversee discovery, the direct involve\u00adment of judges in settlement negotiations, and sua sponte dismissals. Other, subject-matter-specific examples include the right of the federal government to intervene in qui tam actions under the False Claims Act.[footnote]See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03730(b) (2012).[\/footnote] At the other extreme, some doctrines <em>punish<\/em> only especially egregious abuses of delegated power after they have already occurred\u2014either in the course of the litigation itself, as in the case of Rule 11 and discovery sanc\u00adtions, or in collateral proceedings, as in the case of tort actions for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. In between are doctrines that leave the delegations intact but allow courts to <em>withhold<\/em> enforcement from specific exercises of delegated power that contravene public values. The foremost examples of this strategy are courts\u2019 discretionary decisions refusing to compel discovery and quashing subpoenas, the constitutional ban on race-based peremptory challenges to prospective jurors in civil cases (so-called civil <em>Batson<\/em>),[footnote]See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 631 (1991).[\/footnote] and the line of procedural due process cases addressing State prejudgment attachment proceedings.[footnote]See infra note 198 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Article\u2019s first contribution, then, is to theorize civil procedure\u2019s response to the problem of delegated state power in ordinary civil litiga\u00adtion. A second contribution is to explicate the normative logic underly\u00ading civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines. According to that logic, the delegation-policing doctrines perform a function that this Article calls \u201ccomplicity avoidance.\u201d The basic idea, immanent in the civil <em>Batson<\/em> case and other case law, is that when a private party abuses delegated state power, she thereby renders the state <em>complicit<\/em> in her wrongdoing; civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines allow the state to avoid this complicity by disavowing a particular exercise of dele\u00adgated power that offends public values. The logic of complicity avoidance is rooted in liberal political theory, which undergirds the American constitutional order and its criteria for defining the legitimate exercise of political power.[footnote]This invocation of liberal political theory is orthogonal to the enduring debate over whether the U.S. Constitution\u2019s ideological underpinnings are \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201crepublican.\u201d See, e.g., Philip Hamburger, Liberality, 78 Tex. L. Rev. 1215, 1217\u201324 (2000) (reviewing the debate); Suzanna Sherry, Property Is the New Privacy: The Coming Constitutional Revolution, 128 Harv. L. Rev. 1452, 1458 n.21 (2015) (collecting sources on both sides of the debate). The answer is almost certainly \u201cboth.\u201d See, e.g., Jack M. Balkin, Which Republican Constitution?, 32 Const. Comment. 31, 35 (2017) (reviewing Randy E. Barnett, Our Republican Constitution: Securing the Liberty and Sovereignty of We the People (2016)) (\u201cThe American constitutional tradition, understood in its best sense, has always drawn on elements of <em>both<\/em> the republican and liberal traditions\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Indeed, many scholars have argued that the American varieties of liberalism and republicanism are largely reconcilable. See, e.g., 1 Bruce Ackerman, We the People: Foundations 29\u201332 (1991) (defending \u201cliberal republicanism\u201d). In any event, the specific element of liberal political theory on which this Article focuses\u2014its account of political power\u2014is sufficiently ecumenical to accord with a wide range of constitutional theories. For further discussion, see infra section III.D.1.[\/footnote] Most versions of liberalism hold that the state\u2019s coercive power is collectively authorized by the members of the political commu\u00adnity and exercised in their name. This creates the imperative for the state, acting on behalf of the political community, to repudiate objection\u00adable exercises of delegated power by private parties during civil litigation. On this account, liberal political theory provides a strong justification for the current shape of our civil justice system.\r\n\r\nThe theory of complicity avoidance also connects civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines to other, substantive legal doctrines that are similarly concerned with ensuring that public power does not end up facili\u00adtating objectionable private projects. The two foremost examples of the latter are <em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em>, which applied constitutional law\u2019s state action doctrine to prohibit courts from enforcing racially restrictive covenants,[footnote]334 U.S. 1, 19\u201321 (1948).[\/footnote] and contract law\u2019s unconscionability doctrine, as reconcep\u00adtualized by Seana Shiffrin.[footnote]See generally Seana Valentine Shiffrin, Paternalism, Unconscionability Doctrine, and Accommodation, 29 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff. 205 (2000) [hereinafter Shiffrin, Paternalism] (defending the unconscionability doctrine as a means by which courts can refuse to facilitate objectionable private conduct).[\/footnote] This Article thus shows civil proce\u00addure\u2019s delega\u00adtion prob\u00adlem to be but one manifestation of a much more pervasive problem that is addressed through substantive doctrines else\u00adwhere in the law.\r\n\r\nIn exploring civil procedure\u2019s delegations and its various strategies for policing them, this Article develops an analytical framework that bears on several pressing procedural problems. But here the focus is on the impli\u00adcations for perhaps the most urgent one: arbitration. One of the Article\u2019s main contentions is that the delegations in arbitration differ from the del\u00adegations in ordinary civil litigation in degree rather than kind.[footnote]Other scholars have noted certain functional similarities between ordinary civil litigation and arbitration but not the specific similarity analyzed in this Article. Resnik has long criticized what she views as the encroachment of the contract-based norms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) into ordinary civil litigation, through practices such as court-annexed ADR. See, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2806\u201307, 2844\u201350; Judith Resnik, Many Doors? Closing Doors? Alternative Dispute Resolution and Adjudication, 10 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 211, 212 (1995); Resnik, Privatization, supra note 6, at 1814; Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 622\u201323. This Article, by contrast, reverses the direction of the normative migration, conceiving of ADR as an extension of the delegations that have long been present in ordinary civil litigation.\r\nIn a similar vein, Richard Freer has recently argued that, with the demise of the civil trial, ordinary civil litigation has increasingly come to resemble arbitration, but in the specific sense that both now focus narrowly on the resolution of individual disputes and fail to realize the \u201cbroader goals and values\u201d traditionally associated with adjudication, such as governmental transparency, democratic participation, and law generation. Richard D. Freer, Exodus from and Transformation of American Civil Litigation, 65 Emory L.J. 1491, 1492 (2016). Moreover, in contrast to this Article, Freer attributes this convergence to various historical contingencies rather than to any fundamental feature of civil procedure, such as its delegation of many state dispute-resolution functions to private parties. See id. at 1493.[\/footnote] And yet, many proponents of the delegation critique advocate policy proposals for arbitration that differ from civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtion-policing doctrines in kind rather than degree. They tend, in particular, to seek to restrict arbitration\u2019s delegations, insisting either that courts deem broad categor\u00adies of arbitration clauses unenforceable, so as to channel many more disputes into public venues,[footnote]See, e.g., Radin, Fine Print, supra note 8, at 166\u201367, 173\u201374, 183; Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 441\u201343; Schwartz, Small Print, supra note 8, at 125\u201332; Jean R. Sternlight, Creeping Mandatory Arbitration: Is It Just?, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 1631, 1661\u201373 (2005) [hereinafter Sternlight, Mandatory Arbitration]; see also infra note 332 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] or that arbitrators be required to employ court-like procedures, so as to conform to the proce\u00addural norms of public adjudication.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 600 (insisting that arbitral \u201cprocesses have to look more like what courts do than not\u201d); Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1054\u2013100; Sternlight, Rethinking, supra note 9, at 80\u201397; see also infra note 334 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] These are reasonable responses, especially given the gross power asymmetries that produce the most controversial arbitration clauses. Nonetheless, even if courts leave arbitra\u00adtion\u2019s delegations largely intact, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines suggest an alterna\u00adtive approach that could render those dele\u00adgations less troubling\u2014more akin to the delegations we have come to accept in ordinary civil litigation.\r\n\r\nRather than restrict <em>access<\/em> to arbitration\u2019s delegations before any abuse has occurred, such an approach would focus on <em>policing<\/em> exercises of delegated power for abuse after the fact. More specifically, a delega\u00adtion-policing approach would address the abuse of delegated state power in arbitration by subjecting arbitrators\u2019 decisions to more searching judi\u00adcial scrutiny. That scrutiny could take a number of different forms, including allowing interlocutory review of key procedural decisions by arbitrators, more frequently granting motions to vacate (or more frequently refusing to confirm) arbitral awards that issue from proceed\u00adings marred by especially serious procedural or substantive defects, and even sanctioning parties who seek to confirm such awards. While some of these proposals would require amending the FAA, others could be implemented through more faithful judicial interpretations of the statute than the Supreme Court has rendered. To be sure, even robust ex post policing mechanisms would not solve all of the problems with arbitration; ex ante regulation might still be necessary to address some of the very worst abuses, such as class-arbitration bans.[footnote]See infra note 341 and accompanying text. But see Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 133 S. Ct. 2304, 2308\u201312 (2013) (holding that the FAA requires courts to enforce class-arbitration waivers); AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 351\u201352 (2011) (holding that the FAA preempted California\u2019s ban on class-arbitration waivers).[\/footnote] The point is that, even if arbitration clauses con\u00adtinue to be enforced more often than arbitration\u2019s critics think legitimate, both arbitral proceedings and awards should be subject to greater judicial scrutiny than current doctrine permits.\r\n\r\nAlthough other scholars have also called for this kind of enhanced judicial review, they typically present it as only one among many indiscrim\u00adinate limits on arbitration.[footnote]See infra notes 335\u2013336 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] What distinguishes a delegation-policing approach is that it sees ex post judicial review as a distinct strategy, one grounded in the same logic underlying the doctrines that respond to civil procedure\u2019s own delegation problem.\r\n\r\nThe Article proceeds as follows. Part I makes the case for concep\u00adtual\u00adizing the exercise of various dispute-resolution functions by private parties in ordinary civil litigation as a delegation of state power. Part\u00a0II then explains why civil procedure\u2019s delegations need to be policed and examines the different procedural doctrines that fill that role. Those doctrines, Part III shows, perform a complicity-avoidance function analo\u00adgous to that performed by various substantive doctrines\u2014a function that cannot be understood in standard due process terms. Turning to the implications for debates about arbitration, Part IV identifies several ways in which the delegations in arbitration can be policed, even if not eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion reflects on some of the Article\u2019s methodological impli\u00adcations. It contends that civil procedure scholars tend to underesti\u00admate the extent of civil procedure\u2019s delegations and to exaggerate the differences between arbitration and ordinary civil litigation because of the discipline\u2019s overreliance on the procedural due process framework, which is concerned with the procedures of state institutions rather than the exercise of state power by private parties. Greater attention to liberal political theory and its account of political power can help us to conceptualize many of the problems presented by the privatization of civil justice and to uncover solutions latent in civil procedure doctrine itself.\r\n<h2>I. Civil Procedure\u2019s Delegations<\/h2>\r\nIn criticizing arbitration for \u201cprivatizing\u201d or \u201coutsourcing\u201d dispute resolution, proponents of the delegation critique assume a traditional conception of ordinary civil litigation as being part of \u201ca rigidly indepen\u00addent public legal system.\u201d[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 45; see also Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2806 (noting that typically, \u201c[c]ourts are equated with public processes\u201d).[\/footnote] There are many different senses in which our civil justice system might be considered \u201cpublic.\u201d But for purposes of the delegation critique (and hence this Article), the most important is that \u201c[c]ourts are seen as\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. proceeding under a system not of their users\u2019 personal design but fashioned by bodies of rule-makers committed to procedural neutrality and subjected to public scrutiny.\u201d[footnote]Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2834.[\/footnote] Civil litigation, on this view, is public insofar as it is administered by state institutions\u2014courts\u2014that, in turn, proceed according to state-made rules.[footnote]See, e.g., Owen M. Fiss, The Supreme Court, 1978 Term\u2014Foreword: The Forms of Justice, 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 30\u201331 (1979) (arguing that a judge \u201cis a public officer; paid for by public funds; chosen not by the parties but by the public or its representatives; and empowered by the political agencies to enforce and create society-wide norms\u201d); Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1048 (\u201cVirtually all of th[e] activity [in ordinary civil litigation] takes place in the public courthouse and is presided over by a judge with plenary power to administer and decide the case as he or she deems appropriate.\u201d); cf. David Marcus, From \u201cCases\u201d to \u201cLitigation\u201d to \u201cContract\u201d: A Comment on Stability in Civil Procedure, 56 St. Louis U. L.J. 1231, 1237 (2012) (identifying as the presumptively \u201clegitimate\u201d procedural form the \u201cideal-type\u201d of the \u201cindividual lawsuit,\u201d in which \u201cthe case proceeds before a detached, neutral judge in a courtroom open to the public\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Part aims to complicate that picture of ordinary civil litigation. The traditional conception actually conflates two distinct issues. The first is the nature of the functions performed in the course of resolving private disputes.[footnote]Cf. Metzger, supra note 4, at 1424 (arguing that an \u201cinquiry into the nature of the powers exercised by private entities\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is essential given the way that privatization not only enhances private actors\u2019 power over others, but provides them with forms of authority conventionally understood to constitute government power\u201d).[\/footnote] On that issue this Article agrees with proponents of the delega\u00adtion critique\u2014and will argue in more detail in this Part\u2014that binding \u201cdispute-resolution services constitute an inherently govern\u00admental func\u00adtion,\u201d and indeed \u201can aspect of sovereignty.\u201d[footnote]Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe second issue is <em>who<\/em> actually performs the various dispute-reso\u00adlution functions involved in ordinary civil litigation. Given the scholarly rhetoric extolling the \u201cpublic\u201d nature of our civil justice system, one might be tempted to think that those functions are performed exclu\u00adsively by state officials and institutions.[footnote]To be sure, civil procedure scholars have criticized certain aspects of contem\u00adporary civil litigation, such as contract procedure and court-annexed ADR, as forms of \u201cprivatization.\u201d But they depict these features as departures from, and corruptions of, ordinary civil litigation\u2019s fundamentally public nature. See supra notes 10, 26.[\/footnote] Scholars have, however, long recognized that civil procedure puts various powers in the hands of private parties rather than judges.[footnote]See, e.g., David A. Sklansky &amp; Stephen C. Yeazell, Comparative Law Without Leaving Home: What Civil Procedure Can Teach Criminal Procedure, and Vice Versa, 94 Geo. L.J. 683, 684 (2006) (\u201cCivil litigation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. has been essentially privatized\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] This Part argues that many of these private exercises of power in ordinary civil litigation should be concep\u00adtualized as <em>delegations<\/em> of state power.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this Part contends that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure delegate state power to private parties in the following func\u00adtional sense: At various points in the litigation, the Rules enable the par\u00adties to force the court to deploy coercive power for their own purposes. The Rules may technically interpose a state official in some of those instances, such that the parties cannot be said to <em>formally<\/em> wield coercive power, but the official nevertheless has little or no discretion to preempt the parties\u2019 decisions, such that the parties <em>effectively<\/em> wield coercive power in the first instance.[footnote]This is different from the claim that the Federal Rules allow litigants to engage in \u201crulemaking,\u201d in the sense of selecting the procedural rules that will govern their dispute. See Robert G. Bone, Party Rulemaking: Making Procedural Rules Through Party Choice, 90 Tex. L. Rev. 1329, 1342\u201352 (2012) [hereinafter Bone, Party Rulemaking]; see also Stephen C. Yeazell, Civil Procedure 138 (7th ed. 2008) (noting that many procedural rules are merely \u201cdefault rules\u201d); Robin J. Effron, Ousted: The New Dynamics of Privatized Procedure and Judicial Discretion, 98 B.U. L. Rev. 127, 141\u201344 (2018) (cataloging the various ways in which the Federal Rules defer to party \u201cpreference\u201d or \u201cagreement\u201d). By contrast, this Article contends that the Rules sometimes allow litigants (either formally or effectively) to exercise the state\u2019s coercive power, whether through \u201crulemaking\u201d or otherwise.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSection I.A briefly elaborates this Article\u2019s conception of a delega\u00adtion of state power. Section I.B then examines three of the most notable delegations in civil procedure, while section I.C considers two general objections to conceptualizing any part of ordinary civil litigation as a del\u00adegation of state power.\r\n<h3>A. Defining Delegation<\/h3>\r\nTo determine when the state delegates power to private parties, we can use either a narrow, formal conception of a delegation or a broader, functional one. On the formal conception, the state delegates power when it authorizes a private party to act on its behalf with respect to other private parties, as when the government contracts with a private entity to administer a public benefits program. This is the prevailing con\u00adception among public law scholars[footnote]See, e.g., Metzger, supra note 4, at 1456, 1462\u201370 (arguing that the creation of an agency relationship is the most significant criterion for identifying a delegation of state power); Jed Rubenfeld, Privatization, State Action, and Title IX: Do Campus Sexual Assault Hearings Violate Due Process? 25 n.132 (Yale Law Sch., Pub. Law Research Paper No. 588, 2016), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2857153 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (consider\u00ading state action \u201ccases in which government uses private parties for its own ends\u2014i.e., when it delegates powers to private parties but continues to direct their objectives\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014and for understandable reasons. For one thing, \u201cdelegation\u201d is a loaded (and, at least in public law con\u00adtexts, largely pejorative) term, so it makes sense to reserve that label for situations that are thought to raise the most serious concerns. For another, by cabining the category of delegations, we can avoid the sweep\u00ading implication that <em>all<\/em> power held by private parties is delegated state power, which would threaten to eliminate any distinction between state authority and private ordering.[footnote]See Metzger, supra note 4, at 1462 &amp; n.326; see also infra note 47 (discussing the realist critique of the public\u2013private distinction).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe functional conception of a delegation, by contrast, does not look for an agency relationship between the state and a private party but rather focuses on who controls the application of coercive power as a practical matter, regardless of who holds it as a formal matter. On this view, a private party is delegated state power when she can prompt a state official or institution to coerce another private party without the official\u2019s or institution\u2019s first having an opportunity to assess the grounds on which the coercion is being exercised. Although the coercive power may for\u00admally be vested with the state rather than the private party, the private party alone determines its initial application, and so effectively holds the power in the first instance.\r\n\r\nWhile we should appreciate the risks associated with expanding the notion of a delegation, it is nevertheless useful to conceptualize such pri\u00advately initiated exercises of coercion as delegations of state power. Only by doing so can we make sense of the delegation critique of arbitration, which presupposes the broader conception of a delegation. As we shall see, the current arbitration regime does not formally authorize private parties\u2019 chosen arbitrators to reach binding resolutions of private disputes; rather, it effectively renders arbitrators\u2019 decisions binding by requiring courts to enforce them without any meaningful review.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.1.[\/footnote] Arbi\u00adtration thus delegates (or \u201cprivatizes\u201d) state power only in the functional sense.\r\n\r\nThe functional delegations, moreover, raise the same normative con\u00adcerns as the formal ones. State power is distinguished by its coercive\u00adness,[footnote]See infra section III.D.1; see also, e.g., David M. Lawrence, Private Exercise of Governmental Power, 61 Ind. L.J. 647, 647\u201348 (1986) (identifying \u201cgovernmental\u201d powers in terms of the exercise of coercion). But cf. Lillian BeVier &amp; John Harrison, The State Action Principle and Its Critics, 96 Va. L. Rev. 1767, 1785 (2010) (distinguishing state action according to \u201cthe presence or absence of a decisive choice by a private person,\u201d rather than the presence or absence of coercion). Without wading into longstanding philosophical debates about the nature of coercion, this Article accepts that state power is coercive in the sense that the state \u201ctypically backs its commands and prohibitions with the credible threat of brute force or other sanctions in the event of noncompliance.\u201d Frederick Schauer, The Force of Law 5 (2015).[\/footnote] but the state can enable private parties to exercise coercion other than by formally making them its agents. That is perhaps no more true than in civil procedure. What makes the various dispute-resolution powers involved in civil litigation \u201cinherently governmental\u201d or \u201caspect[s] of sovereignty\u201d[footnote]Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535.[\/footnote] is the fact that they are <em>binding<\/em>\u2014immediately backed by coercion.[footnote]Cf. Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 375 (1971) (recognizing \u201cthe State\u2019s monopoly over techniques for binding conflict resolution\u201d).[\/footnote] As Part III explains more fully, liberal political theory has tra\u00additionally conceived of the state as possessing a monopoly on the legiti\u00admate use of coercion. And indeed, the next section shows that the coer\u00adcive dispute-resolution powers in civil litigation are the kinds of powers that have traditionally been exercised by the state and that continue to be exercised by the state in other contexts. Yet the next section also iden\u00adtifies a number of significant points in civil litigation at which private par\u00adties initially determine the application of coercive power. These privately initiated exercises of coercion test the limits of the traditional liberal con\u00adception of the state just as much as formal conferrals of authority to act on the state\u2019s behalf do, and thus equally merit the \u201cdelegation\u201d label.[footnote]By contrast, even on this functional account, extralegal, custom-based regimes of dispute resolution do not involve a delegation of state power. See generally, e.g., Robert C. Ellickson, Order Without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes (1994) (using disputes between cattle ranchers in Shasta County, California, to demonstrate how neighbors often rely on social norms, rather than the formal legal system, to resolve disputes); Lisa Bernstein, Opting Out of the Legal System: Extralegal Contractual Relations in the Diamond Industry, 21 J. Legal Stud. 115 (1992) (explaining how the diamond industry has established its own dispute-resolution system independent of any state-run legal system).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSome might worry that the functional conception of a delegation proves too much, implying that all de facto power held by one private party over another is delegated state power. While that might follow if the state delegated power simply by enforcing, or giving effect to, private parties\u2019 choices, the functional conception of a delegation requires some\u00adthing more. When the state makes itself available to coercively enforce certain private choices, it generally retains broad discretion to set the terms on which it will provide that support; think, for instance, of the intricate legal regime governing the enforcement of private contracts.[footnote]Cf. Margaret Jane Radin, Boilerplate: A Threat to the Rule of Law?, <em>in<\/em> Private Law and the Rule of Law 288, 300 (Lisa M. Austin &amp; Dennis Klimchuk eds., 2014) [hereinafter Radin, Threat] (arguing that the state\u2019s coercive \u201c[e]nforcement of exchanges by private ordering\u201d is legitimated by a \u201cbackground legal infrastructure\u201d that leaves the state with significant discretion to scrutinize the voluntariness and substance of private agreements).[\/footnote] The examples considered in this Article go much further: As the next section shows, the Federal Rules often effectively <em>require<\/em> courts to exer\u00adcise coercive power at private parties\u2019 behest, denying them any meaning\u00adful discretion to withhold that coercion, at least as an initial matter. One can recognize those instances as delegations without having to maintain that the state delegates power whenever it supports private ordering.[footnote]Thus, even as this Article seeks to broaden the notion of a delegation, it still main\u00adtains a distinction between \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d\u2014a distinction legal realists have famously dismissed as illusory. For prominent contemporary versions of that criticism, see Louis Michael Seidman &amp; Mark V. Tushnet, Remnants of Belief: Contemporary Constitutional Issues 61\u201367 (1996) (arguing that, given the conceptual confusion surrounding the public\u2013private distinction, \u201cthe state action analysis ought to be abandoned altogether\u201d); Cass R. Sunstein, The Partial Constitution 351\u201353 (1993) [hereinafter Sunstein, Partial Constitution] (discussing the state\u2019s role in setting the legal baselines against which private ordering occurs). Notwithstanding the force of the realist critique, the public\u2013private distinction remains an enduring feature of legal practice and scholarship and indeed a \u201cfoundational premise of our constitutional order.\u201d Metzger, supra note 4, at 1369\u201370; see also, e.g., Radin, Fine Print, supra note 8, at 36 (\u201c[O]ur society\u2019s underlying commitment to the idea of private ordering, which is embedded in our legal infrastructure of contract, unequivocally relies on the existence of a distinction between the realms of public and private action and ordering\u2014a public\/private distinction.\u201d); J.M. Balkin, Populism and Progressivism as Constitutional Categories, 104 Yale L.J. 1935, 1968\u201369 (1995) (reviewing Cass R. Sunstein, Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech (1993)) (suggesting that, rather than \u201cabolish the distinctions between concepts like public and private,\u201d we should \u201cunderstand these boundaries as more flexible\u201d); cf. Jody Freeman, The Private Role in Public Governance, 75 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 543, 551 (2000) (conceding that \u201cthe particular coercive power of the state\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is undeniable\u201d even while endorsing the realist critique of the public\u2013private distinction). That is perhaps no more apparent than in the delegation critique of arbitration itself, which presupposes fairly distinct public and private spheres and purports to distinguish between public and private exercises of state power. This Article thus assumes the distinction\u2019s validity.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. Delegated Procedural Powers<\/h3>\r\nThis section contends that three of the most significant aspects of ordinary civil litigation today\u2014prosecution, discovery, and settlement\u2014involve delegations of state power. At each of those stages, the Federal Rules effectively allow private parties to exercise coercive powers over others without prior judicial approval. There is a tendency, moreover, to deem those same powers \u201cpublic\u201d when exercised by state officials in other contexts; they remain public when exercised by private parties in the course of ordinary civil litigation.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Prosecution<\/em>. \u2014 From the very outset of a lawsuit, the Federal Rules vest private parties with significant power. Rather than charge state offi\u00adcials with prosecuting civil claims or require victims to vet their claims with state institutions before filing suit, the Rules generally authorize \u201caggrieved victims of wrongs to enlist the adjudicative machinery of the state in seeking redress.\u201d[footnote]Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 687. There are a number of notable exceptions to this general rule for certain kinds of claims. See David Freeman Engstrom, Agencies as Litigation Gatekeepers, 123 Yale L.J. 616, 644\u201355 (2013) [hereinafter Engstrom, Litigation Gatekeepers] (discussing instances in which administrative agencies serve as \u201cgatekeepers,\u201d screening legal claims before potential plaintiffs may proceed to court).[\/footnote] Civil procedure scholars have, for the most part, failed to closely analyze the nature of the civil prosecutorial power,[footnote]An important, if limited, exception is the extensive body of scholarship on the \u201cprivate enforcement\u201d of public regulatory laws. See infra note 291 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] but it has garnered more attention from proponents of the \u201ccivil recourse\u201d theory of tort law. One of civil recourse theory\u2019s main claims is that \u201c[t]ort law\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is about empowering <em>private parties<\/em> to initiate pro\u00adceed\u00adings designed to hold tortfeasors accountable.\u201d[footnote]John C.P. Goldberg &amp; Benjamin C. Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs, 88 Tex. L. Rev. 917, 946\u201347 (2010) [hereinafter Goldberg &amp; Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs]; see also Benjamin C. Zipursky, Civil Recourse, Not Corrective Justice, 91 Geo. L.J. 695, 720\u201321, 735 (2003) [hereinafter Zipursky, Civil Recourse] (noting that defendants in tort suits are under no legal obligation to pay damages until a plaintiff has brought suit and secured a verdict in her favor). At times, Goldberg and Zipursky appear to argue that plaintiffs possess not just a prosecutorial power to initiate a lawsuit but also a remedial power to \u201cexact\u201d or take something from the wrongdoer should they prevail on their claims. See, e.g., Goldberg &amp; Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs, supra, at 919; Zipursky, Civil Recourse, supra, at 718\u201319. The latter would arguably constitute another significant delegation of state power, but the claim is controversial, and this Article does not pursue it as an example of delegation in ordinary civil litigation.[\/footnote] Replace \u201ctortfeasors\u201d with \u201cwrongdoers,\u201d and this claim actually describes a power enjoyed by all potential civil plaintiffs, not just tort plaintiffs.[footnote]See Arthur Ripstein, Private Wrongs 271\u201372 (2016) [hereinafter Ripstein, Private Wrongs]; John Gardner, Torts and Other Wrongs, 39 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 43, 47 (2011); Scott Hershovitz, Harry Potter and the Trouble with Tort Theory, 63 Stan. L. Rev. 67, 102 n.105 (2010); Ori J. Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, 65 U. Toronto L.J. 99, 109 (2015) [hereinafter Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers]; Gregory C. Keating, The Priority of Respect over Repair, 18 Legal Theory 293, 312 (2012). Indeed, civil recourse theorists have basically conceded the point, see, e.g., John C.P. Goldberg &amp; Benjamin C. Zipursky, Civil Recourse Revisited, 39 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 341, 348\u201354 (2011); Zipursky, Civil Recourse, supra note 50, at 734, and some scholars have attempted to extend civil recourse theory beyond tort law, see, e.g., Nathan B. Oman, Consent to Retaliation: A Civil Recourse Theory of Contractual Liability, 96 Iowa L. Rev. 529, 531\u201334 (2010) (developing a civil recourse account of contract law).[\/footnote] More precisely, Ori Herstein, a sympathetic critic of civil recourse theory, has explained that a civil plaintiff\u2019s ability to initiate a lawsuit includes both (1) a Hohfeldian <em>power<\/em> to subject another private party to the judicial process and to the courts\u2019 authority to alter the parties\u2019 legal rights and (2) a Hohfeldian <em>privilege<\/em> to decide whether to exercise that power.[footnote]Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, supra note 51, at 104, 109; see also Zipursky, Civil Recourse, supra note 50, at 741 (\u201cA right of action is a privilege and a power\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). See generally Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning (Walter Wheeler Cook ed., 1919) (distinguishing between various juridical relations, including privileges and powers).[\/footnote] That combination means that private parties, rather than state officials, generally get to decide who will be subject to the courts\u2019 authority to adjudicate civil claims.\r\n\r\nThe power to initiate a lawsuit, while significant, is not in itself coer\u00adcive. But the Rules go a step further, backing that power with an addi\u00adtional, coercive power. Rule 4 provides: \u201cOn or after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal. If the summons is properly completed, the clerk <em>must<\/em> sign, seal, and issue it to the plaintiff for service on the defendant.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(b) (emphasis added).[\/footnote] This effectively grants plain\u00adtiffs the power not only to initiate the judicial process but also to hale their opponents into court. To be sure, given the role of the court clerk in issu\u00ading the summons, the latter power technically amounts to a Hohfeldian <em>claim right<\/em> on the part of the plaintiff to have the state exer\u00adcise <em>its<\/em> power to hale people into court.[footnote]Cf. Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, supra note 51, at 121 (\u201c[Tort] victims hold a claim against the court to exercise its own legal power over tortfeasors in accordance with the victims\u2019 rights for redress.\u201d).[\/footnote] But that claim right is essen\u00adtially absolute, for the clerk has no discretion to withhold the summons so long as the plaintiff\u2019s complaint satisfies the necessary formalities.[footnote]See 4A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a01084, at 614 &amp; n.5 (4th ed. 2015). Rather than require a clerk\u2019s signature, some States even allow a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer to sign the summons. See id. at 614\u201315 &amp; n.6.[\/footnote] In substance, then, if not in form, the Federal Rules assign the power to hale others into court to private parties rather than state officials.\r\n\r\nThat power is coercive.[footnote]See Barbara Allen Babcock et al., Civil Procedure: Cases and Problems 104 (4th ed. 2009) (\u201c[B]ehind that innocent-looking piece of paper titled \u2018Summons\u2019 stands the full coercive power of the State.\u201d).[\/footnote] Once the summons issues and the plaintiff properly attempts to serve it on the defendant, the defendant must enter an appearance in the action, on pain of default.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a).[\/footnote] The Rules thus empower a plaintiff to order other parties to appear in court and then to compel the court to coercively enforce that order\u2014all virtually on the plaintiff\u2019s own say-so.[footnote]The unilateral nature of this power has led at least one scholar to argue, on various doctrinal grounds, that Rule 4 is unconstitutional. See E. Donald Elliott, <em>Twombly<\/em> in Context: Why Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(b) Is Unconstitutional, 64 Fla. L. Rev. 895, 911\u201357 (2012).[\/footnote] The effects of that coercion for the defendant can be significant, including the expense of hiring a lawyer and exposure to public scrutiny, as well as more formal legal consequences such as pre\u00adjudgment attach\u00adment of property.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 64.[\/footnote] On the other hand, the coercion may be relatively ephemeral; a spurious complaint can be dismissed fairly quickly,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12.[\/footnote] and even a default or default judgment can, in certain circum\u00adstances, be set aside.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c).[\/footnote] The point is that the named defendant must generally appear before the court to get the complaint dismissed or the default or default judgment set aside, a burden imposed by the unilat\u00aderal, unsupervised actions of the plaintiff.[footnote]The liberal rules of permissive joinder and third-party impleader only augment the plaintiff\u2019s prosecutorial power, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 13, 14, 18, 20\u2014especially considering how much latitude plaintiffs enjoy in deciding whom to join, see Stephen C. Yeazell, The Misunderstood Consequences of Modern Civil Process, 1994 Wis. L. Rev. 631, 654 [hereinafter Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nA number of considerations confirm that the coercive power to hale others into court is a delegated state power. For one, we tend to associate the power to compel individuals to appear before state bodies with the state itself. That association is partly a product of history. Throughout much of the nineteenth century, American courts had discretion to review the substance of a plaintiff\u2019s pleadings before issuing a sum\u00admons.[footnote]See Elliott, supra note 58, at 914\u201321.[\/footnote] One finds formal vestiges of this history in the Federal Rules: Though instigated at the plaintiff\u2019s sole discretion, a summons issues in the name of the court. It is formally the court, not the plaintiff, that orders the defendant to appear.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(F)\u2013(G) (requiring that a summons \u201cbe signed by the clerk\u201d and \u201cbear the court\u2019s seal\u201d).[\/footnote] And it is formally the court, not the plaintiff, that coercively enforces that order with a default judgment.[footnote]Specifically, when the defendant fails to appear and the plaintiff seeks to recover \u201ca sum certain,\u201d the court clerk \u201c<em>must<\/em>\u201d enter a default judgment if the plaintiff so requests. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1) (emphasis added). By contrast, when the plaintiff seeks an amount that is not certain, or when the defendant appears after having failed to answer the complaint, the court has broader discretion to decide whether to enter a default judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2).[\/footnote] The Rules thus formally profess state authorship over the very same pow\u00aders that they functionally put in the hands of private parties, one of the hallmarks of a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\nFor another, most agree on the public nature of the <em>criminal<\/em> prose\u00adcu\u00adtorial power\u2014the power to decide who must answer for alleged criminal conduct and to compel those individuals to appear in court.[footnote]To be sure, private parties prosecuted criminal actions throughout most of English history. See John H. Langbein, Ren\u00e9e Lettow Lerner &amp; Bruce P. Smith, History of the Common Law: The Development of Anglo-American Legal Institutions 29\u201335, 578\u201389 (2009). And while the United States introduced public prosecutors early in its history, the practice of private prosecution persisted in certain quarters well into the nineteenth century. See id. at 746\u201349. But for at least a century, the prevailing view has been that criminal prosecution is exclusively a state function. See Roger A. Fairfax, Jr., Delegation of the Criminal Prosecution Function to Private Actors, 43 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 411, 413 (2009) (\u201cMost observers reasonably view criminal prosecution as a function to be performed exclusively by the state.\u201d).[\/footnote] While the criminal prosecutorial power may have more significant conse\u00adquences for defendants than the civil prosecutorial power,[footnote]Most notably, criminal prosecution exposes defendants to potential criminal punishment, whereas civil prosecution exposes defendants only to potential civil remedies.[\/footnote] both ulti\u00admately reduce to the power to coercively hale people into court to answer for alleged wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nOne might resist this analogy on the ground that civil litigation typi\u00adcally redresses private wrongs, as opposed to the public wrongs redressed through the criminal law and certain regulatory-style civil actions. More specifically, even conceding that the state delegates power when it autho\u00adrizes private parties to bring criminal prosecutions, as well as certain civil enforcement actions, in its stead, one might still deny that any delegation extends to ordinary lawsuits seeking to vindicate private law rights, such as tort and contract actions. Seth Davis\u2019s \u201cstate action\u201d theory of standing doctrine is a sophisticated example of this position. According to Davis, \u201c[s]tanding involves a government power when it authorizes a litigant to act on a government\u2019s behalf to vindicate a government interest.\u201d[footnote]Davis, supra note 18, at 590; cf. Metzger, supra note 4, at 1456 (\u201c[T]he central criterion for singling out particular private delegations for enhanced scrutiny is whether they authorize private entities to act on the government\u2019s behalf, a factor usually established by assessing whether the requirements of agency are met.\u201d).[\/footnote] \u201cStand\u00ading does not,\u201d by contrast, \u201cdelegate the public power to enforce the law where it satisfies the government\u2019s obligation to provide remedies to redress personal wrongs and to keep government accounta\u00adble, even if the litigant\u2019s action would vindicate a public right.\u201d[footnote]Davis, supra note 18, at 591. But cf. Sean Farhang, The Litigation State: Public Regulation and Private Lawsuits in the U.S. 8 (2010) (\u201cThe standing statutorily conferred on private actors to enforce public regulatory laws in court effectively licenses them to wield the coercive instruments of state power.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is important to emphasize that Davis focuses on only one aspect of the civil prosecutorial power. In using the term \u201cstanding,\u201d Davis is refer\u00adring simply to the right of a specific plaintiff to bring a specific claim against a specific defendant.[footnote]See Davis, supra note 18, at 595.[\/footnote] The notion of governmental authorization does indeed offer a plausible test for determining when the exercise of that right involves a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\nBut as we have seen, the right to initiate a lawsuit does not exhaust the civil prosecutorial power in the American civil justice system; the Federal Rules also effectively grant plaintiffs the power to hale defend\u00adants into court, on pain of default. This power, which Davis does not sep\u00adarately consider, is equally present even in cases Davis deems \u201cprivate,\u201d in which private parties are not authorized to vindicate a governmental interest. One need not maintain that \u201cprivate standing and government standing are synonymous\u201d[footnote]Id. at 601.[\/footnote] or \u201cgive[] short shrift to [standing\u2019s] role in realizing rights to remedies\u201d[footnote]Id. at 604.[\/footnote] to recognize that all civil cases involve this limited (though still significant) delegation, even if a narrower subset of civil cases involve an <em>additional<\/em> delegation of the power to enforce the law on the government\u2019s behalf.\r\n\r\nDavis appears to want to cabin the delegation involved in the civil prosecutorial power because he believes that any delegation of state power entails a duty on the part of the private party exercising the dele\u00adgated power to subordinate her own private interests to public values.[footnote]See id. at 601\u201304.[\/footnote] Such a duty, Davis suggests, would be inappropriate in ordinary private law cases, in which plaintiffs should have wide latitude to pursue their own interests in seeking a remedy, without regard to public values.[footnote]See id.; cf. BeVier &amp; Harrison, supra note 42, at 1785 (premising constitutional law\u2019s state action requirement \u201con the thesis that private individuals are principals, entitled to act to pursue their own interests, whereas government decisionmakers are agents, whose function is to further the interests of the citizens\u201d).[\/footnote] Davis purports to derive this limitation from civil recourse theory,[footnote]See Davis, supra note 18, at 601\u201304.[\/footnote] yet civil recourse theorists themselves use the language of delegation to describe the civil prosecutorial power.[footnote]See, e.g., Benjamin C. Zipursky, Torts and the Rule of Law, <em>in<\/em> Private Law and the Rule of Law, supra note 46, at 139, 148 (referring to \u201cthe power the state <em>affords to<\/em> private individual litigants\u201d (emphasis added)).[\/footnote] More to the point, as the next Part shows, civil procedure already requires plaintiffs to restrain their use of the civil prosecutorial power for the sake of certain public values, even when they are not authorized to act on the government\u2019s behalf but are instead permitted to pursue their own interests. Unsurprisingly, these restrictions are significantly less demanding than the restrictions Davis would impose on plaintiffs standing in for the government as law enforcer; after all, the power to enforce the law is typically an even more solemn state power than the power to coercively hale people into court. But while the latter delegation may be less significant than the former, it remains a delegation nonetheless.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Discovery<\/em>. \u2014 The Federal Rules do not cease delegating state power once the plaintiff has summoned the defendant to appear in court. On the contrary, the state continues to delegate significant coer\u00adcive power to both parties throughout the most consequential stage of civil litigation: discovery. Civil procedure scholars have long recognized that discovery is carried out primarily by the parties and their lawyers rather than the court;[footnote]See, e.g., Arthur R. Miller, Simplified Pleading, Meaningful Days in Court, and Trials on the Merits: Reflections on the Deformation of Federal Procedure, 88 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 286, 353 (2013) [hereinafter Miller, Simplified Pleading]; Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences, supra note 62, at 651.[\/footnote] it makes sense to conceptualize this feature of civil litigation, too, as a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\nThe structure of that delegation mirrors the structure of the delega\u00adtion involved in the civil prosecutorial power. Just as the Rules grant plaintiffs the power to order defendants to appear in court, so they grant both parties the power to order each other, as well as nonparties, to disclose information. As the Supreme Court observed less than a decade after the promulgation of the Rules, \u201c[e]ither party may compel the other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession.\u201d[footnote]Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507 (1947).[\/footnote] What was then true only functionally became true formally in 1970, when Rule 34 was amended to eliminate the (oft-ignored) requirement of a court order for discovery requests; the amendment authorized a party to directly request from the other party any document or object within the scope of discovery specified in Rule 26.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a). As the Advisory Committee explained, the point of the amendment was to have Rule 34 \u201coperate extrajudicially, rather than by court order.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1970 amendment.[\/footnote] One party can also demand that the other answer up to twenty-five interrogatories without a court order.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 33.[\/footnote] A party\u2019s discovery powers extend over not only the other party but nonparties as well. Under Rule 45, a party can subpoena a nonparty to pro\u00adduce any discoverable documents or objects in her possession.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(c) (\u201cAs provided in Rule 45, a nonparty may be compelled to produce documents and tangible things or to permit an inspection.\u201d).[\/footnote] A party can also subpoena \u201cany person\u201d (including the other party) to \u201ccom\u00adpel[]\u201d her attendance at a deposition.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(1) (oral examination); Fed. R. Civ. P. 31(a)(1) (written ques\u00adtions); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(1). A party must seek the court\u2019s permission to con\u00adduct more than ten depositions (unless the parties stipulate to more). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(A)(i).[\/footnote] A subpoena technically issues in the name of the court but is drafted by the party or her lawyer and is signed either by the lawyer or the court clerk, who must leave the sub\u00adpoena \u201cotherwise in blank.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a)(3).[\/footnote] At a deposition, a party can compel the deponent to answer any question that does not require the disclosure of privileged information, notwithstanding any objections (which are merely \u201cnoted on the record\u201d).[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2). Although a deposition must technically be taken before an \u201cofficer,\u201d that person is usually just a stenographer or notary public who lacks authority to rule on objections or adjudicate disputes between the parties. Fed. R. Civ. P. 28.[\/footnote] Time and time again, the Federal Rules allow the parties to order others to disclose information without prior judicial approval.[footnote]To be sure, at various points, the Rules encourage the parties to cooperate in plan\u00adning and conducting discovery. See Effron, supra note 38, at 138\u201348. But such cooperation typically does not involve nonparties, and it occurs (if at all) in the shadow of the coercive power that the Rules delegate to each party.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs with the civil prosecutorial power, the Rules back the parties\u2019 dis\u00adcovery powers with the coercive power of the state\u2014and once again leave courts with little control over how that power is wielded in the first instance. If one party refuses to comply with another party\u2019s discovery request, the party who made the request can move for a court order com\u00adpelling disclosure on pain of sanctions.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)\u2013(b).[\/footnote] This forces the resistant party to either oppose the motion or turn over the requested information; she cannot simply sit back and ignore the other party\u2019s demands, lest she be sanctioned for noncompliance. The parties enjoy even more direct con\u00adtrol over the state\u2019s coercive power with respect to discovery involving nonparties. A subpoena issued by a party under Rule 45 (whether signed by the party\u2019s lawyer or the clerk) is treated as an order of the court,[footnote]9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a02453, at 396 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cAlthough an attorney-issued subpoena is in a sense merely the command of the attorney who completes the form, noncompliance with a subpoena by the recipient is an act in defiance of a court order.\u201d).[\/footnote] with noncompliance punishable as contempt.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(g).[\/footnote] Although a nonparty can move to quash a subpoena,[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3).[\/footnote] she must take that affirmative step or otherwise face coercive sanctions simply because of the issuing party\u2019s unilat\u00aderal actions.\r\n\r\nWe should be careful not to overstate the extent of the powers exer\u00adcised by private parties during discovery. Those powers have undoubtedly waned since 1938, as \u201csuccessive amendments to the Federal Rules ha[ve] impressed limits on the extent of discovery.\u201d[footnote]Arthur R. Miller, From <em>Conley<\/em> to <em>Twombly<\/em> to <em>Iqbal<\/em>: A Double Play on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 60 Duke L.J. 1, 52 (2010) [hereinafter Miller, Double Play]; see also Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 353\u201356 (discussing changes to the discovery rules in the late twentieth century).[\/footnote] Rule 26, for instance, was amended in 2015 to prohibit discovery that is not \u201cpropor\u00adtional to the needs of the case.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). The impact of the 2015 amendments to the discovery rules will depend on individual judges\u2019 willingness to employ the largely discretionary tools they authorize. See Morris A. Ratner, Restraining Lawyers: From \u201cCases\u201d to \u201cTasks,\u201d 85 Fordham L. Rev. 2151, 2167 (2017) (discussing the potential impact of the amend\u00adments on judicial case management); see also Andrew S. Pollis, Busting up the Pretrial Industry, 85 Fordham L. Rev. 2097, 2115 (2017) (expressing concern that the amendments leave judges with too much discretion over discovery). Some scholars have criticized the amendments, and particularly the proportionality requirement, as \u201canti-plaintiff.\u201d See, e.g., Patricia Hatamyar Moore, The Anti-Plaintiff Pending Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Pro-Defendant Composition of the Federal Rulemaking Committees, 83 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1083, 1085\u201386 (2015) (arguing that various amendments to the Federal Rules over the last few decades have disadvantaged plaintiffs).[\/footnote] Notwithstanding the increasing limits on discovery, however, it remains the case that parties still enjoy signifi\u00adcant power to compel others to produce information without much judicial involve\u00adment.[footnote]See Amalia D. Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition: Equity Procedure, Due Process, and the Search for an Alternative to the Adversarial, 90 Cornell L. Rev. 1181, 1256 (2005) [hereinafter Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition] (\u201c[D]espite the widely recognized problems with party control of discovery, the attempts we have made to pro\u00advide greater court control have been fairly limited\u2014authorizing judges to hold scheduling conferences and to appoint pretrial discovery masters, but leaving primary responsibility with the parties.\u201d).[\/footnote] Indeed, \u201cfrom a comparative perspective [the dis\u00adcovery power in American civil litigation] is broader and deeper than the powers exercised by private lawyers in any other legal system.\u201d[footnote]Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 694.[\/footnote] While private parties\u2019 discovery powers may have been curbed, they have not been eliminated.[footnote]This Article considers the implications of increased \u201cmanagerial judging\u201d sepa\u00adrately below. See infra section I.C.2.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBut why understand these powers as delegated <em>state <\/em>powers? Perhaps as much as any other civil procedure scholar, Stephen Yeazell has pointed toward an answer, and his account is worth quoting at length:\r\n<blockquote>Discovery empowers litigants. In a civil law system litigants can only attempt to persuade a judge to seek information from the parties or others. American law, on the other hand, allows the litigants to demand information and testimony and backs those demands with legal sanctions. From such a comparative standpoint, the power delegated to ordinary litigants by the American discovery system is astounding. Ordinary civil litigants receive state sanction to require documents, depose witnesses under oath, and more. The penalties for noncompliance are substantial, including not only consequences to a litigant within the lawsuit, but also extending to possible imprisonment or fines of non-party witness[es] who fail to comply. We have put in the hands of civil litigants powers that in many legal systems only state officials enjoy.[footnote]Stephen C. Yeazell, Socializing Law, Privatizing Law, Monopolizing Law, Accessing Law, 39 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 691, 699 (2006); see also Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 694\u201395 (similar). For an unfavorable comparison of the American system of lawyer-driven discovery with civil law systems, see John H. Langbein, The German Advantage in Civil Procedure, 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 823, 823\u201324 (1985).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nTo wit, in most other Western liberal democracies, judges exercise the very same discovery powers that private parties exercise in our civil justice system.[footnote]And if not judges, then administrative agencies. See Paul D. Carrington, Renovating Discovery, 49 Ala. L. Rev. 51, 54 (1997) (\u201cPrivate litigants do in America much of what is done in other industrial states by public officers working within an adminis\u00adtrative bureaucracy.\u201d).[\/footnote] There is also a long history, extending well into the nineteenth century, of judicially conducted, inquisitorial-style discovery in American courts of equity, a practice that formed the basis for the party-conducted discovery authorized by the Federal Rules.[footnote]See Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition, supra note 92, at 1206. On the rise and fall of equity procedure in the United States during the nineteenth century, see generally Amalia D. Kessler, Inventing American Exceptionalism: The Origins of American Adversarial Legal Culture, 1800\u20131877 (2017).[\/footnote] This all suggests an association between discovery powers and the state\u2014an association that still has some resonance in our civil justice system, if one is to judge from all of the formal markers of state authority that pervade the discovery rules, such as the fact that an \u201cattorney acts as an officer of the court in issuing and signing subpoenas.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1991 amendment.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEven within the contemporary American legal system, state officials and institutions\u2014most notably, police officers[footnote]See Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 694 (\u201cIn many respects the lawyers representing the parties in civil actions have in their hands powers remarkably like those exercised by police investigators in criminal matters.\u201d).[\/footnote] and administrative agen\u00adcies[footnote]See Farhang, supra note 69, at 8 (\u201cThe American civil discovery process effectively confers upon private litigants and their lawyers the same investigatory powers as federal agencies to <em>compel<\/em> sworn testimony and to disgorge documents\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote]\u2014exercise investigatory powers that are functionally indistin\u00adguishable from the discovery powers exercised by private parties in civil litigation.[footnote]Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1991 amendment (\u201cThe 1948 revision of Rule 45 put the attorney in a position similar to that of the administrative agency, as a public officer entitled to use the court\u2019s contempt power to investigate facts in dispute.\u201d).[\/footnote] The investigatory powers are considered public in those contexts not just because they are wielded by state agents but because they func\u00adtion as necessary adjuncts of an unquestionably public power: the power to enforce the law. Yet, as we have seen, private parties gen\u00aderally exercise the (coercive aspect of the) state\u2019s law-enforcement power in our civil justice system.[footnote]See supra section I.B.1.[\/footnote] Given the close relationship between discovery powers and the power to enforce the law, it makes sense to view the former as a state power too.[footnote]Cf. Carrington, supra note 96, at 54 (\u201c[D]iscovery is the American alternative to the administrative state. We have by means of Rules 26-37, and by their analogues in state law, privatized a great deal of our law enforcement\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Federal Rules themselves implicitly underscore the pub\u00adlic nature of the discovery powers exercised by private parties during civil litigation. In addition to authorizing the parties to compel each other to disclose information, the Rules establish a limited number of mandatory \u201cinitial disclosures\u201d\u2014certain categories of information that the parties must reveal to each other, independent of any request.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a). Even these \u201crequired\u201d disclosures, however, can be waived by the parties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A).[\/footnote] This highlights the fact that the state can choose either to directly compel the disclosure of information itself or to grant that power to private parties. When the state makes the latter choice, as it does for most discovery matters, it seems difficult to describe that as anything other than a delegation of state power.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Settlement<\/em>. \u2014 The case for conceptualizing the settlement of an ongoing lawsuit as a delegation of state power seems fairly straightfor\u00adward. With few exceptions, the court plays virtually no role in the settle\u00adment of a civil case; the parties may \u201cgenerally elect to settle disputes and to choose their settlement terms without judicial oversight or inter\u00adference.\u201d[footnote]Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 429; see also Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 698 (\u201c[A]n \u2018active role for the trial court in approving the adequacy of a settlement\u2019 remains today \u2018the exceptional situation, not the general rule.\u2019\u201d (quoting United States v. City of Miami, 614 F.2d 1322, 1331 (5th Cir. 1980))). The main exception is Rule 23(e), which requires judicial approval of class action settlements. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). Judicial approval is also required for settlements in shareholder derivative actions, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1(c), and settlements reached under certain statutes, such as consent dec\u00adrees in antitrust cases, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a016(b)\u2013(e) (2012).[\/footnote] Yet settlements bind the parties, and it is commonly thought that the power to reach a binding resolution of a private dispute is a paradigmatic state power.[footnote]See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 375 (1971) (recognizing \u201cthe State\u2019s monopoly over techniques for binding conflict resolution\u201d); Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne might think that, in contrast to haling a person into court or compelling her to disclose information, settling a case is too far removed from state-sanctioned coercion to involve the exercise of state power. This impression is bolstered by the default procedure for dismissing a settled lawsuit in federal court. After the parties privately agree to settle the case, the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the action by filing either a notice of dismissal (if before the defendant\u2019s answer or summary judg\u00adment motion) or a stipulation of dismissal signed by all the parties (if later)\u2014but either way, without having to obtain a court order.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A).[\/footnote] Given this procedure, \u201csettlements do not implicate the judiciary\u2019s judgment\u201d as to either liability or remedy.[footnote]Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 430; see also Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 697 (\u201cSettlement\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is a private, largely invisible, contractual phenomenon; the judge plays a role only as a potential facilitator of private agreement.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The overwhelming majority of settlements require only that the parties agree; the court is told only that the plaintiff is dismissing the case.\u201d).[\/footnote] The state in no way lends its imprimatur to the parties\u2019 resolution of the dispute but rather acts as if the lawsuit had never been filed. Formally, then, most settlement agreements look like any other private contract, and unless we are willing to completely jettison the public\u2013private distinction,[footnote]See supra note 47.[\/footnote] merely forming a voluntary agreement does not involve the exercise of a delegated state power.[footnote]Cf. Metzger, supra note 4, at 1444 (\u201c[T]he power to resolve disputes on a <em>nonconsensual<\/em> basis, even subject to later state court review, is one that government cannot delegate to private actors without preserving some opportunity for prior review.\u201d (emphasis added)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the dismissal procedure laid out in the Rules, how\u00adever, courts often issue an order dismissing a settled case and incorporate the parties\u2019 settlement agreement into the order\u2014without necessarily hav\u00ading supervised the negotiation of the agreement or approved its terms.[footnote]One of the primary ways this occurs in federal court is under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America<\/em>, which held that a federal district court may exercise \u201cancillary jurisdiction\u201d over a subsequent action to enforce a settlement agreement, notwithstanding the absence of federal question and diversity jurisdiction, so long as it entered an order dismissing the original, settled action while also \u201cincorporating\u201d or \u201cretaining jurisdiction over\u201d the agreement in its order. 511 U.S. 375, 381\u201382 (1994). For other ways in which courts blur the formal boundary between settlements and court judgments, including through practices such as consent decrees, see Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 628, 630\u201333, 637, 662\u201365.[\/footnote] This practice transmutes the parties\u2019 private resolution of their dispute into a formal court order subject to ongoing coercive enforce\u00adment by the state, while forgoing the judicial scrutiny that typically precedes such an order. In this respect, settlements that are incorporated into a court order are difficult to distinguish from the delegations of state power involved in a summons or party-issued subpoena.\r\n\r\nEven settlements that are not memorialized in a court order gen\u00aderally end up functioning in practice much more like formal judgments than ordinary contracts. A prevailing plaintiff usually enforces a court judgment against a recalcitrant defendant through separate procedures that leave state officials with little discretion to withhold relief.[footnote]In federal district court, the enforcement of money judgments is generally gov\u00aderned by the law of the State in which the court sits. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a). State law typically provides for enforcement through a combination of writ-like procedures and separate enforcement actions. See Herstein, How Tort Law Empowers, supra note 51, at 124\u201330. Federal court judgments compelling specific actions are enforced via clerk-issued writs. Fed. R. Civ. P. 70(c)\u2013(d).[\/footnote] A violated settle\u00adment agreement, by contrast, is usually enforced through a separate State law action for breach of contract.[footnote]See J.J. Prescott &amp; Kathryn E. Spier, A Comprehensive Theory of Civil Settlement, 91 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 59, 65 (2016).[\/footnote] So far, court judg\u00adments and settlement agreements seem to inhabit completely different remedial worlds. But the contract law principles that govern the enforcement of settlement agreements can diverge from those that govern the enforcement of ordinary contracts in crucial respects. Compared with ordinary contracts, settlement agreements require an especially \u201cstrong showing\u201d of invalid\u00adity[footnote]15A C.J.S. Compromise &amp; Settlement \u00a7\u00a033 (2017); see also, e.g., Hallock v. State, 474 N.E.2d 1178, 1180\u201381 (N.Y. 1984) (\u201cStipulations of settlement are favored by the courts and not lightly cast aside.\u201d (citing In re Galasso, 320 N.E.2d 618, 618 (N.Y. 1974))).[\/footnote] and are more difficult to rescind.[footnote]See, e.g., Compromise &amp; Settlement, supra note 114, \u00a7\u00a067 (\u201c[A] mistake that would authorize the setting aside of an ordinary contract will not in all cases justify the setting aside of a compromise agreement.\u201d).[\/footnote] Their terms are also construed more liberally.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a034.[\/footnote] And as with a court judgment, a \u201ccourt will not inquire into the merits or validity of the original claim\u201d when enforcing a settlement agreement.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a077.[\/footnote] Some juris\u00addictions even go so far as to formally treat settlement agreements as court judgments, according them the same preclusive effect.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a027.[\/footnote] These and other departures from general contract principles leave courts with significantly less discretion to refuse to coercively enforce settlement agreements, versus ordinary contracts\u2014much as state officials have little discretion to refuse to coercively enforce court judgments. Yet in the case of settlement, it is the parties themselves, not state officials, who have authoritatively resolved their dispute.[footnote]Taking this feature of settlement agreements to its logical extreme, the Supreme Court has offered limited approval of cognovit (or confession of judgment) notes, provisions in loan agreements that require the debtor to prospectively waive her right to notice and a hearing before a court may enter judgment in favor of the creditor upon default. See D.H. Overmyer Co. v. Frick Co., 405 U.S. 174, 187 (1972). Cognovit notes thus go even further than ordinary settlement agreements, forcing the court to enter a formal, binding judgment without any appearance by the debtor and without regard to the merits of the case.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOther kinds of settlement practices grant private parties even more direct control over the state\u2019s coercive power. For example, under Rule 68, a defendant can make an \u201coffer of judgment\u201d to the plaintiff.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 68.[\/footnote] If the plaintiff accepts the offer, \u201c[t]he clerk must then enter judgment\u201d; if the plaintiff refuses and ends up securing a judgment no more favorable than the spurned offer, then she is liable to the defendant for \u201cthe costs incurred after the offer was made.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 68(a), (d).[\/footnote] This constitutes a kind of con\u00adtingent delegation to the defendant: Simply by making a settlement offer during the litigation, a defendant can force the court either to enter a binding judgment (in the event the offer is accepted) or to sanction the plaintiff (in the event the offer is rejected and the plaintiff\u2019s actual award does not exceed the offer). Either way, the defendant is compelling the court to deploy the state\u2019s coercive power without any opportunity for the court to evaluate the basis on which it is being deployed.[footnote]A similar account can be given of stipulations made by the parties during litigation. As scholars have recognized, a stipulation can be understood as a partial settlement, in the sense that it resolves some important aspect of the case but without terminating the litigation. See Prescott &amp; Spier, supra note 113, at 62\u201364. As such, a stipulation can also be understood as a partial delegation, for it limits the grounds on which a court can deploy the coercive power of the state but without fully determining how that power is deployed.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>C. Doubting Delegation<\/h3>\r\nAt various points, the previous section addressed a number of specific objections to conceiving of civil procedure\u2019s prosecution, discovery, and settlement powers as delegated state powers. This section briefly considers two additional, more thoroughgoing objections: (1) that private parties are formally \u201csubordinate\u201d to courts and (2) that \u201cmana\u00adgerial judges\u201d oversee parties\u2019 litigation conduct to such an extent that none of that conduct can constitute a private exercise of delegated state power.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Party Subordinance. \u2014 <\/em>Even assuming that the powers discussed in the previous section are public, one still might question whether the Rules really allow private parties to exercise those powers in ordinary civil litigation\u2014whether, that is, the powers are actually delegated. Scott Dodson\u2019s elaboration of what he calls the \u201cparty subordinance\u201d thesis suggests a particularly potent challenge along these lines. According to that thesis, \u201cparties\u2019 attempts to alter otherwise applicable procedures\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. are wholly unenforceable absent some legal authorization for judicial enforcement. And even when the law allows parties to exercise litigation choices, courts retain largely unfettered discretion\u2014cabined only by law\u2014to disregard or override those choices.\u201d[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 6\u20137; see also Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 562\u201363 (identifying various procedural rules that require courts to override party preferences).[\/footnote] Dodson does not con\u00adsider in any significant detail the specific contexts addressed in the previous section\u2014prosecution, discovery, and settlement[footnote]Dodson\u2019s only significant discussion of discovery, for example, focuses narrowly on Rule 29, which concerns parties\u2019 stipulations regarding discovery procedures. See Dodson, supra note 14, at 22.[\/footnote]\u2014but his account nonetheless suggests that, even in those contexts, we should view courts, rather than litigants, as exercising ultimate control over the state\u2019s coer\u00adcive power.\r\n\r\nDodson\u2019s party-subordinance thesis purports to describe the <em>formal<\/em> rules governing civil litigation,[footnote]See, e.g., id. at 7, 19 (emphasizing parties\u2019 lack of \u201cformal control over litigation\u201d).[\/footnote] but it is difficult to justify this exclu\u00adsively formal focus. Surely what matters is who controls the state\u2019s coer\u00adcive power as a practical matter, not who bears nominal responsibi\u00adlity for its exer\u00adcise.[footnote]Cf. Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 537\u201340 (arguing that delegations can be \u201cplanned\u201d or \u201cde facto\u201d).[\/footnote] And as the previous section showed, the rules governing prosecution, discovery, and settlement functionally \u201cempower[] or allow[] party dominance\u201d while denying courts \u201cdiscretion to override lawful party choices\u201d with respect to the initial exercise of coercive power[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 19.[\/footnote]\u2014in contrast to the impression the party-subordinance thesis might create.\r\n\r\nNor does the existence of even substantial judicial discretion necess\u00adarily preclude a delegation of state power. After all, public law scholars conceptualize the \u201cprivatization\u201d of various governmental programs as a delegation of state power even though administrative agencies must formally authorize private entities to administer the programs and retain discretion to override their decisions, which are also often subject to judi\u00adcial review.[footnote]See, e.g., Metzger, supra note 4, at 1377\u2013400; cf. Nagareda, supra note 18, at 191\u201398 (arguing that Rule 23 delegates lawmaking authority to lawyers in class actions, even though the court must ultimately approve any class settlement).[\/footnote] That is presumably because, notwithstanding the govern\u00adment\u2019s supervisory authority, private parties are still exercising state power in the first instance and thus can potentially cause serious harm before the government has a chance to intervene. Private parties likewise exercise multiple state powers in the first instance during ordinary civil litigation. While we may think that the prospect of judicial intervention serves as an adequate check on any potential abuse of those powers, the risk of abuse still exists. The delegation framework developed in the previous section calls attention to such concerns, whereas a narrow focus on private parties\u2019 formal \u201csubordinance\u201d to courts tends to occlude them.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Managerial Judges<\/em>. \u2014 Another objection is more practical than conceptual. This Part has argued that parties enjoy wide latitude in exercising various coercive powers during civil litigation, often with no meaningful judicial involvement. But many will no doubt dispute this depiction of judges as relatively passive bystanders. According to a popu\u00adlar critique of contemporary federal civil practice, the demise of the civil trial has not diminished the judicial role so much as transformed it. Rather than adjudicate cases, judges now perform a more \u201cmanagerial\u201d function, shepherding cases and litigants through the pretrial phase.[footnote]This critique is most prominently associated with Judith Resnik. See Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2844\u201350; Judith Resnik, Failing Faith: Adjudicatory Procedure in Decline, 53 U. Chi. L. Rev. 494, 496 (1986); Judith Resnik, Managerial Judges, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 374, 374 (1982); Resnik, Privatization, supra note 6, at 1803\u201306; Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 610\u201319; Judith Resnik, Trial as Error, Jurisdiction as Injury: Transforming the Meaning of Article III, 113 Harv.

Gensler, Judicial Case Management: Caught in the Crossfire, 60 Duke L.J. 669, 669 (2010); Miller, Double Play, supra note 90, at 54\u201361, 78\u201381; Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 292\u201393; Jonathan T. Molot, An Old Judicial Role for a New Litigation Era, 113 Yale L.J. 27, 27 (2003); Todd D. Peterson, Restoring Structural Checks on Judicial Power in the Era of Managerial Judging, 29 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 41, 41 (1995). But see Steven Baicker-McKee, Reconceptualizing Managerial Judges, 65 Am. U. L. Rev. 353, 353 (2015) (defending managerial judging).[\/footnote] This judicial management takes a number of different forms, exempli\u00adfied for critics by the (discretionary) Rule 16 pretrial conference, during which the judge can structure the discovery process and pretrial motions practice.[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 16. Another source of judges\u2019 management authority is the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0471\u2013482 (2012), which requires federal district courts to develop procedures to combat expense and delay.[\/footnote] While judicial management does not extend to the prose\u00adcution of a case\u2014plaintiffs still decide which claims to press and whom to name as defendants\u2014it has fundamentally reshaped discovery and settle\u00adment; what were once largely private, consensual processes now often unfold under the court\u2019s watchful eye.[footnote]Indeed, one of the main criticisms of \u201cmanagerial judging\u201d is that judges can use their managerial authority to unduly pressure parties to forgo trials and settle their cases. See Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 638\u201345; see also Marc Galanter &amp; Mia Cahill, \u201cMost Cases Settle\u201d: Judicial Promotion and Regulation of Settlements, 46 Stan. L. Rev. 1339, 1342\u201346 (1994) (discussing factors that influence judicial intervention in settlements).[\/footnote] One might think, therefore, that courts retain too much control over the state\u2019s coercive powers during civil litigation for those powers to be delegated to the parties.[footnote]Cf. Robert G. Bone, Who Decides? A Critical Look at Procedural Discretion, 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 1961, 1967\u201371 (2007) [hereinafter Bone, Who Decides?] (describing various forms of discretion judges enjoy under the Federal Rules, though not focusing on the Rules considered in this Part); Stephen N. Subrin &amp; Thomas O. Main, Braking the Rules: Why State Courts Should Not Replicate Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 67 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 501, 508\u201310 (2016) (similar). But see Bone, Who Decides?, supra, at 1995 n.137 (\u201c[M]uch of what happens at the pretrial stage takes place outside the judge\u2019s view[].\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to quarrel with this picture of the \u201cmanagerial judge\u201d as a descriptive matter, but it is important to distinguish two different ideas that often go under the heading \u201cjudicial management,\u201d each of which has different implications for the delegation thesis advanced in the pre\u00advious section. First, there is <em>management as housekeeping<\/em>\u2014administrative measures that help to ensure the orderly progression of the pretrial pro\u00adcess. For discovery, judges can set schedules for making various disclosures and raising various objections.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3); Ratner, supra note 91, at 2153.[\/footnote] As for settlement, because judges gener\u00adally have no say in the content of settlement agreements,[footnote]See supra note 105 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] they are largely relegated to encouraging the parties to settle and facilitating negotiations between them.[footnote]See Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 701. Rule 16 expressly lists \u201cfacilitating settlement\u201d as one of the goals of the pretrial conference. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(a)(5).[\/footnote] None of these forms of judicial involvement significantly curtails the parties\u2019 discretion in exercising coercive powers; the parties can still largely compel whatever discovery, or settle on whatever terms, they would like. At least the \u201chousekeeping\u201d aspect of the \u201cmanagerial judges\u201d thesis, then, is compatible with concep\u00adtualizing the parties\u2019 discov\u00adery and settlement powers as delegations of state power.\r\n\r\nSecond, there is <em>management as supervision<\/em>\u2014judicial scrutiny of, and interference with, the parties\u2019 exercise of power during discovery and settlement. Although judges generally do not set strict limits on the scope of discovery,[footnote]See, e.g., John S. Beckerman, Confronting Civil Discovery\u2019s Fatal Flaws, 84 Minn. L. Rev. 505, 561\u201371 (2000); John L. Carroll, Proportionality in Discovery: A Cautionary Tale, 32 Campbell L. Rev. 455, 463 (2010).[\/footnote] they sometimes do, especially in complex cases.[footnote]See Ratner, supra note 91, at 2153\u201354, 2164. The court\u2019s pretrial order may \u201cmodify the extent of discovery.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3)(B)(ii). Judicial limits on the scope of discovery are by no means uncontroversial; some scholars have argued that such limits undermine the private enforcement of public regulatory regimes. See Carrington, supra note 96, at 60\u201362.[\/footnote] Likewise, judges in some cases go beyond simply encouraging settlement and actively participate in negotiations, even advocating specific settlement terms.[footnote]See Bone, Who Decides?, supra note 132, at 1968 (noting that \u201ca judge can choose from a diverse menu of options\u201d regarding settlement promotion); Bert I. Huang, Trial by Preview, 113 Colum. L. Rev. 1323, 1368 (2013) (\u201c[C]ourts\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. vary as to how much of a role the future trial judge is allowed to play in settlement negotiations before trial.\u201d); Sklansky &amp; Yeazell, supra note 37, at 699 (\u201cThe civil rules cast the judge in the role\u2014should she wish to assume it\u2014of participant and even persuader, convening the parties and suggesting various possibilities of settlement and creative approaches to bridging disagreements between the parties.\u201d); Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences, supra note 62, at 657 (describing revisions to Rule 16 as \u201cfurther encourag[ing] judges\u201d to \u201cencourag[e] settlement\u201d and noting the debate about the desirability of such a role). See generally Ellen E. Deason, Beyond \u201cManagerial Judges\u201d: Appropriate Roles in Settlement, 78 Ohio St. L.J. 73, 77\u2013104 (2017) (canvassing the different ways in which judges can be involved in settlement).[\/footnote] Again, these practices, while not uncommon, are not the norm; notwithstanding the fact that some judges \u201care vigorously presiding, sometimes as managers, sometimes as judges,\u201d it is still the case that \u201clawyers\u2019 procedural choices will draw only sporadic judicial scrutiny.\u201d[footnote]Yeazell, Misunderstood Consequences, supra note 62, at 638, 647; cf. Ratner, supra note 91, at 115 tbl.1 (identifying \u201c[v]ariation among judges and cases\u201d as a significant limit on the effectiveness of managerial judging).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe default in ordinary civil litigation thus remains a regime of party-driven discovery and settlement, with only the prospect of more significant judicial involvement lurking in the background. And even that involve\u00adment does not <em>eliminate<\/em> the delegations described in the previous section. Rather, as the next Part argues, we should understand \u201cmana\u00adgerial judging,\u201d in its more supervisory guises, as a set of strategies for <em>policing<\/em> civil procedure\u2019s delegations when private parties abuse dele\u00adgated state power.\r\n<h2>II. Policing Civil Procedure\u2019s Delegations<\/h2>\r\nThis Part shows that civil procedure, even as it pervasively delegates coercive state power to private parties, also contains numerous doctrines that enable courts to police its delegations for abuse. Public law scholars have long recognized the potential for delegations of state power to be abused and the corresponding need for the state to police them. As section\u00a0II.A argues, civil procedure\u2019s delegations are no less prone to abuse, though the abuse assumes a different form in civil litigation than in the public law contexts on which scholars have primarily focused.\r\n\r\nSection II.B then collects and classifies myriad procedural doctrines that allow courts to police private parties\u2019 exercises of delegated state power during ordinary civil litigation. The doctrines fall into three main categories: those that rescind a delegated power, those that withhold enforcement from an exercise of delegated power, and those that punish abuse of delegated power. Whereas other scholars have tended to treat these various doctrines as unrelated to one another, this Part aims to show that they perform the common function of allowing the state to distance itself from private exercises of delegated power that offend especially important public values.\r\n<h3>A. Abusing Delegated Procedural Powers<\/h3>\r\nRecall the structure of civil procedure\u2019s delegation problem: At vari\u00adous points during ordinary civil litigation, the Federal Rules effectively grant private parties the power to coerce others but without requiring prior judicial approval for those exercises of coercion. That creates a significant risk that the state\u2019s coercive power will be abused\u2014we have learned as much from the extensive literature on the \u201cprivatization\u201d of many of the government\u2019s administrative functions.[footnote]See generally Government by Contract: Outsourcing and American Democracy (Jody Freeman &amp; Martha Minow eds., 2009) (discussing the growth of government and the outsourcing of governmental functions to private entities); Paul R. Verkuil, Outsourcing Sovereignty: Why Privatization of Government Functions Threatens Democracy and What We Can Do About It (2007) (evaluating the role of private contractors in performing governmental functions); Metzger, supra note 4 (analyzing the constitutionality of the \u201cprivatization\u201d of governmental functions); Minow, Public and Private Partnerships, supra note 1 (considering the effects of privatization on public values).[\/footnote] But just as the delegations at issue in public law contexts differ from civil procedure\u2019s delegations in important respects, so we need a different conception of abuse of state power to understand the unique risks posed by the delegations in ordinary civil litigation.\r\n\r\nPublic law\u2019s conception of abuse of delegated state power begins from what Gillian Metzger has called \u201cthe principle of constitutional accounta\u00adbility.\u201d[footnote]Metzger, supra note 4, at 1373.[\/footnote] According to that principle, \u201cthe Constitution imposes limits on the actions that governments can take,\u201d limits that \u201capply to all exercises of government power, whether wielded by officially public or nominally private entities.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Any conception of abuse of delegated state power in civil litigation should start from the same general principle. But public law scholars have cashed out the notion of \u201caccountability\u201d in ways that do not capture the concerns raised by civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtions of state power.\r\n\r\nConsider again Seth Davis\u2019s conception of a delegation as authoriza\u00adtion to act on the government\u2019s behalf.[footnote]See supra notes 68\u201375 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] From that conception, Davis derives a notion of accountability according to which \u201cthe Constitution requires all government action to be justified by reference to some public value.\u201d[footnote]Davis, supra note 18, at 607 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Cass R. Sunstein, Naked Preferences and the Constitution, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 1689, 1692 (1984)); see also id. at 615 (\u201cLiberal democracies demand that government action be based upon public reasons, not raw preferences\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d). Other scholars take a similar view. See, e.g., Lawrence, supra note 42, at 659 (endorsing the principle that governmental officials should exercise their authority to promote \u201csome conception of what is good for the community\u201d).[\/footnote] A private party, on this view, must affirmatively pursue some public-regarding purpose when exercising delegated state power for the delegation to be legitimate; if she instead employs the power to some pri\u00advate end, she violates constitutional norms and abuses the delegation.[footnote]Cf. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a0387 (Am. Law Inst. 1958) (providing that an agent must \u201cact <em>solely<\/em> for the benefit of the principal in all matters connected with his agency\u201d (emphasis added)); Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7\u00a08.01\u2013.06 (Am. Law Inst. 2006) (same). This constitutional principle is embodied in the private nondelegation doctrine, which holds that the government violates due process when it delegates its lawmaking power in ways that allow private parties to regulate others\u2019 conduct for private purposes. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311 (1936). Davis draws on the private nondelegation doctrine in developing his state action theory of standing. See Davis, supra note 18, at 610\u201311, 615\u201316.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat conception of accountability (and abuse) makes sense insofar as the government has authorized private parties to act on its behalf. But as we have seen, the government can delegate state power to private parties without necessarily making them its agents or forbidding them to pursue their own interests.[footnote]Metzger appears to concede this point. See Metzger, supra note 4, at 1468\u201369 (acknowledging the possibility that the state can delegate power to private parties without creating an agency relationship).[\/footnote] Sometimes, the government grants private parties power not so they can directly pursue public objectives in its stead but so they can more effectively pursue private ends that society deems valuable.[footnote]To be sure, by using delegated state power to pursue their own ends, private parties can, through an invisible-hand-like mechanism, also further public goals\u2014even in traditional private law cases. Cf. William J. Novak, The Myth of the \u201cWeak\u201d American State, 113 Am. Hist. Rev. 752, 769\u201371 (2008) (identifying delegation as a state-building strategy). See generally Farhang, supra note 69 (examining how the state uses private enforcement to augment its regulatory capacities). But the existence of such incidental effects does not convert private parties into the government\u2019s agents.[\/footnote] These private exercises of power are nevertheless delegations because of the <em>nature<\/em> of the power private parties wield\u2014in the context of civil litigation, the power to coerce others to take actions in relation to the binding resolution of private disputes.[footnote]Perhaps the clearest doctrinal support for this conception of a delegation is the \u201ccivil <em>Batson<\/em>\u201d case. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991). There, the Supreme Court held that peremptory challenges constitute a delegation of state power, see id. at 626\u201328, notwithstanding the fact that litigants may legitimately exercise those challenges for private purposes, see id. at 626 (\u201cThough the motive of a peremptory challenge may be to protect a private interest, the objective of jury selection proceedings is to determine representation on a governmental body.\u201d). For further discussion of <em>Edmonson<\/em> as a delegation-policing strategy, see infra section II.B.2.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis different conception of delegation calls for different concep\u00adtions of accountability and abuse. When a private party is delegated state power but is not required to affirmatively pursue some public purpose, she remains accountable by not offending certain norms governing the exercise of state power in the course of pursuing her private ends. Con\u00adversely, a private party abuses delegated state power when she violates those norms. The worry in civil procedure is not that private parties will fail to further public goals\u2014they generally are not required to do so\u2014but that they will \u201ccommandeer[] the judicial process\u201d and \u201cforce a publicly subsidized court to <em>sacrifice<\/em> public benefits for purely private interests.\u201d[footnote]Dodson, supra note 14, at 15 (emphasis added).[\/footnote] The risk is one of harm to public values rather than neglect of public duties.\r\n\r\nThus articulated, this account of abuse of civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtions remains largely formal rather than substantive. It identifies the normative structure of the abuse as the violation of important public values, without elaborating on the specific content of those values. It is beyond the scope of this Article to provide a comprehensive account of the pub\u00adlic values whose violation constitutes an abuse of delegated state power,[footnote]I plan to develop a more complete account in future work.[\/footnote] but those values have many sources. One is the Federal Rules themselves. The notion that the Rules are value-free[footnote]See, e.g., Miller, Double Play, supra note 90, at 90 (noting the rulemakers\u2019 \u201cdesire to keep the original Federal Rules textually simple and value neutral as much as possible\u201d).[\/footnote] has long since been debunked; as scholars have recognized, the Rules embody a number of important values, including justice, accuracy, transparency, and effi\u00adciency.[footnote]See, e.g., Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 288 (\u201cWhen the Federal Rules were promulgated in 1938, they embodied a justice-seeking ethos.\u201d); Stephen N. Subrin, How Equity Conquered Common Law: The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in Historical Perspective, 135 U. Pa. L. Rev. 909, 943\u201348 (1987) (arguing that the values of \u201cequity lived on through the Federal Rules\u201d).[\/footnote] Beyond the Rules, substantive law reflects other fundamental normative commitments of our society, such as nondiscrimi\u00adnation. These and other values are, to varying degrees, implicated in private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated state power during civil litigation.\r\n\r\nMany procedural rules and doctrines seek to safeguard these values by requiring <em>courts<\/em> to honor them in the course of adjudicating disputes. Thus, courts must follow certain procedures before rendering decisions, judges may not discriminate against parties based on race, court proceed\u00adings must generally be open to the public, and so on. But because private parties also wield state power during civil litigation, they, too, can violate the norms governing the exercise of that power. Hence the need for <em>delegation-policing<\/em> <em>doctrines<\/em>\u2014doctrines that allow the state to specifically address exercises of delegated state power that offend especially impor\u00adtant public values.\r\n<h3>B. Civil Procedure\u2019s Delegation-Policing Doctrines<\/h3>\r\nCivil procedure generally affords private parties wide leeway to exer\u00adcise delegated state power during civil litigation. Rather than hold private parties to the same standards that govern courts and other public institu\u00adtions, civil procedure brooks a significant amount of abuse of delegated state power as one of the costs of having an adversarial, as opposed to inquisitorial, system.[footnote]Cf. Daniel Markovits, Arbitration\u2019s Arbitrage: Social Solidarity at the Nexus of Adjudication and Contract, 59 DePaul L. Rev. 431, 445\u201348 (2010) (noting that litigants and their lawyers may act contrary to various public values).[\/footnote] There comes a point, however, at which civil pro\u00adcedure deems private parties\u2019 abuse of delegated power too egregious to tolerate and allows the state to counteract that abuse in various ways. This section examines multiple doctrines that police the outer limits of private parties\u2019 discretion to wield delegated state power during civil litigation.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, it is useful to distinguish doctrines that incidentally prevent abuse of delegated state power by limiting parties\u2019 opportunities to exercise it. One particularly controversial example is pleading. By tightening the general pleading standard under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules,[footnote]See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\u201379 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562\u201363 (2007).[\/footnote] the Supreme Court attempted to make it more difficult for com\u00adplaints to survive a motion to dismiss, thereby restricting plaintiffs\u2019 access to discovery\u2014and thus their opportunities to abuse their discovery-related powers.[footnote]This Article brackets the empirical debate over whether <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em> have in fact had this effect. For a recent overview of, and contribution to, that debate, see generally Jonah B. Gelbach, Material Facts in the Debate over <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em>, 68 Stan. L. Rev. 369 (2016) (presenting empirical evidence regarding the adjudication of defendant-filed summary judgment motions after <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em>).[\/footnote] A number of subject-matter-specific rules and statutes impose similar limits on how plaintiffs may prosecute certain kinds of claims.[footnote]E.g., Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-67, \u00a7\u00a0104, 109 Stat. 737, 757 (1995) (imposing special procedural requirements for private actions under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934); Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (imposing a heightened pleading requirement for fraud claims). See generally Jessica Erickson, Heightened Procedure, 102 Iowa L. Rev. 61 (2016) (describing heightened procedural requirements for securities class actions, medical malpractice lawsuits, and product liability cases). State anti-SLAPP laws are another example. As exemplified by California\u2019s statute, anti-SLAPP laws apply to lawsuits that implicate the defendant\u2019s free-speech rights, such as libel actions. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7\u00a0425.16(b), (e) (2018). Defendants in such actions may file \u201ca special motion to strike,\u201d which stays discovery and requires the plaintiff to show, based on whatever evidence she already has, that she is more likely than not to prevail on her claim. See id. \u00a7\u00a0425.16(b), (g).[\/footnote] Such doctrines do not directly regulate the <em>grounds<\/em> on which parties may exercise the powers delegated to them during civil litigation but rather seek to reduce the overall costs of litigation by restricting par\u00adties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to those powers. The doctrines nonetheless have the effect of limiting parties\u2019 opportunities to exercise\u2014and thus to abuse\u2014delegated powers. One can therefore understand the doctrines as embodying a kind of prophylactic strategy for reducing the risk of abuse of delegated state power before it has occurred.\r\n\r\nThat kind of strategy has significant shortcomings. Most notably, the state faces considerable decision costs in trying to anticipate and forestall every potential form of abuse of civil procedure\u2019s delegated powers. Any rule that seeks to restrict access to those powers will consequently be overbroad, which can undermine other values, such as access to justice.[footnote]This is a major basis for criticism of <em>Twombly<\/em> and <em>Iqbal<\/em>. See, e.g., A. Benjamin Spencer, Pleading and Access to Civil Justice: A Response to <em>Twiqbal<\/em> Apologists, 60 UCLA L. Rev. 1710, 1732\u201333 (2013) (arguing that \u201cplausibility pleading is overinclusive and hope\u00adlessly subjective,\u201d that it restricts litigants\u2019 access to justice, and that it is a misguided attempt to curb discovery abuse).[\/footnote] At the same time, even overbroad rules will let some instances of abuse slip by, putting the state in the untenable position of having to tolerate even egregious forms of abuse.\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of such drawbacks, civil procedure does not primar\u00adily rely on this ex ante strategy of limiting access to delegated state power. Rather, it generally affords private parties broad access to its delega\u00adtions[footnote]Cf. Richard Marcus, \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism\u201d in Goals for Civil Litigation, <em>in<\/em> Goals of Civil Justice and Civil Procedure in Contemporary Judicial Systems 123, 123, 134\u201335 (Alan Uzelac ed., 2014) (arguing that American civil procedure is \u201cexceptional\u201d in, among other things, \u201crelaxing burdens on plaintiffs\u201d and permitting \u201cextremely broad discovery\u201d).[\/footnote] and then employs an alternative, ex post strategy whereby the state reviews a party\u2019s exercise of delegated power for its conformity with public values and, if the abuse is too much to bear, interferes with or disavows the private party\u2019s actions, making clear that her abuse of state power cannot stand unchallenged.[footnote]To be clear, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines are enshrined in various rules, statutes, and court decisions before they are applied in any case, and so are in that sense \u201cex ante.\u201d But they are \u201cex post\u201d in the specific sense that courts apply them in response to an abusive exercise of delegated power, whereas access-restricting doctrines, such as pleading rules, attempt to deny private parties the opportunity to exercise delegated power before any abuse has occurred. The ex post policing function resembles the \u201canti-opportunism\u201d or \u201csafety-valve\u201d function that Henry Smith has ascribed to various equitable doctrines. See Henry E. Smith, Equity as Second-Order Law: The Problem of Opportunism 19 (Harvard Pub. Law Working Paper No. 15-13, 2015), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/\r\nabstract=2617413 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); see also Samuel L. Bray, The System of Equitable Remedies, 63 UCLA L. Rev. 530, 578\u201384 (2016) (describing various \u201cequitable constraints\u201d that help to counteract party abuse of equitable remedies).[\/footnote] Civil procedure is replete with doctrines that perform precisely this <em>delegation-policing<\/em> function.[footnote]This Article\u2019s distinction between access-restricting and delegation-policing doc\u00adtrines differs from Joanna Schwartz\u2019s distinction between \u201cgateway\u201d and \u201cpathway\u201d rules in civil procedure. See Joanna C. Schwartz, Gateways and Pathways in Civil Procedure, 60 UCLA L. Rev. 1652, 1654\u201355 (2013). According to Schwartz, \u201c[g]ateway rules limit cost, delay, and unjust outcomes by preventing cases from proceeding to the next stage of litiga\u00adtion, while pathway rules limit cost, delay, and unjust outcomes by controlling troublesome aspects of litigation while allowing cases to proceed.\u201d Id. at 1659. Although most delegation-policing doctrines are pathway rules in this sense, a few terminate the litigation and thus qualify as gateway rules. See, e.g., infra note 179 and accompanying text (discussing sua sponte dismissals). Not all pathway rules, moreover, concern stages of the litigation that involve the exercise of delegated state power. And even among those pathway rules that do, some operate automatically before any abuse has occurred, whereas the delegation-policing doctrines operate through the exercise of judicial discretion after the fact. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) (requiring the parties to make certain \u201cinitial disclosures\u201d \u201cwithout awaiting a discovery request\u201d or court order); Schwartz, supra, at 1659 (classifying Rule 26(a) as a pathway rule). Nor do civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines constitute a form of \u201cad hoc procedure.\u201d Pamela K. Bookman &amp; David L. Noll, Ad Hoc Procedure, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 767, 772\u201373 (2017) (\u201cAd hoc procedure is designed to address a procedural problem that arises in a pending case or litigation. It is then applied retroactively to that pending case or litigation in order to achieve a desired result.\u201d). Although those doctrines operate through the exercise of case-by-case judicial discretion, they are developed before any dispute has arisen rather than during the litigation. See supra note 159.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBefore this section turns to those doctrines, two caveats are in order. First, this Article makes no claim about the origins of civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines. It argues only that various procedural doctrines currently enable courts to police civil procedure\u2019s delegations for abuse, whether or not they were intentionally developed for that purpose.[footnote]Cf. Elena Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 415 (1996) (arguing that various First Amendment doctrines smoke out illicit governmental purposes, regardless of whether they were intentionally devised to perform that function).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, to classify the doctrines considered in this section as dele\u00adgation-policing doctrines is not necessarily to defend them against those who might consider them an inadequate response to the various forms of abuse that can occur during civil litigation. Indeed, civil procedure does not police its delegations consistently but instead tends to address only the most egregious forms of abuse of certain delegations, while ignoring the abuse of other delegations altogether.[footnote]For example, there is no meaningful check on abuse of Rule 68\u2019s offer-of-judgment procedure. See supra notes 120\u2013121 and accompanying text; see also infra notes 299\u2013300 and accompanying text (discussing criticisms of discovery).[\/footnote] That said, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing efforts, however imperfect, address a significant amount of abuse of delegated state power in ordinary civil litigation\u2014especially when compared with the permissiveness of the current arbitra\u00adtion regime.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.1. Civil procedure also responds to significantly more abuse than does public law, which generally ignores \u201cbad faith\u201d conduct by governmental actors. See David E. Pozen, Constitutional Bad Faith, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 885, 918 (2016) (arguing that \u201cjudges have frequently ignored constitutional bad faith\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCivil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines can be classified into three main categories, according to how intrusively they interfere with private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated state power. The following typology is not necessarily comprehensive, nor are the boundaries separating its different categories perfectly clean. The point is to identify the most pro\u00adminent types of delegation-policing strategies in civil procedure.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Rescinding Delegations<\/em>. \u2014 The most intrusive delegation-policing doctrines effectively <em>rescind<\/em> a delegation when it is being abused, and then either reassign responsibility for exercising the delegated state power at issue to a state official or, in extreme cases, deny the private party responsible for the abuse all further access to that power. Among the rescissory doctrines that substitute a state official for the parties are some of the practices that civil procedure scholars have dubbed \u201cmana\u00adgerial judging.\u201d[footnote]See supra section I.C.2.[\/footnote] For example, the Federal Rules permit courts to limit the scope of discovery beyond Rule 26\u2019s capacious relevance standard.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(3)(B)(iii); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).[\/footnote] A court can, of course, exercise this discretion for many different rea\u00adsons, including simply to save time and expense. But at least when a court limits discovery in response to the parties\u2019 abusive discovery practices, one can understand the court\u2019s action as (partially) rescinding the parties\u2019 power to decide what discovery to compel and lodging that power back with a state official\u2014namely, the judge.[footnote]The rescission is only partial because the parties still retain broad discretion to compel discovery within the limits set by the court.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe effect is similar when a court appoints a special master to oversee discovery.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53 (authorizing the court to appoint a special master without the parties\u2019 consent when there is \u201csome exceptional condition\u201d); Acad. of Court-Appointed Masters, Appointing Special Masters and Other Judicial Adjuncts: A Handbook for Judges and Lawyers \u00a7\u00a02.1, at 17\u201318 (2d ed. 2009) (identifying as one \u201cexceptional condition\u201d warranting appointment of a master the fact that \u201c[t]here will be unusual discovery or evidentiary problems requiring continued oversight\u201d).[\/footnote] Such oversight can be quite extensive, including supervising depositions,[footnote]See Acad. of Court-Appointed Masters, supra note 167, \u00a7\u00a01.2, at 4 (\u201cSometimes a discovery master will sit in on depositions that are particularly contentious.\u201d).[\/footnote] during which the Rules otherwise give the par\u00adties free rein. While courts will often appoint a discovery master for rea\u00adsons of efficiency, such as handling complex technical issues involved in electronic discovery,[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a01.3, at 4.[\/footnote] they sometimes also use special masters to curb discovery abuse. In such cases, the court rescinds some of the coercive discovery powers delegated by the Rules, transferring the parties\u2019 discre\u00adtion for exercising those powers to a state official.[footnote]Although a private individual can be appointed as a special master, she is still a state official in the sense that she\u2019s appointed by and accountable to the court. But see Kessler, Our Inquisitorial Tradition, supra note 92, at 1238\u201360 (arguing that, in many cases, special masters are vulnerable to capture by the parties and thus not truly independent).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCourts can also effectively retract the parties\u2019 power to reach a bind\u00ading resolution of their dispute through a settlement agreement. Recall that judges generally have no say over settlements; with few exceptions, the parties can settle their dispute on whatever terms they\u2019d like without the court\u2019s approval.[footnote]See supra note 105 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] In practice, however, some judges go beyond merely encouraging settlement and facilitating negotiations and shape the actual substance of a settlement agreement.[footnote]See supra note 138 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Although the parties formally retain control (it is the parties, after all, who decide whether to stipulate to a dismissal), in some cases the court can exert such influence that it assumes a kind of adjudicatory authority as a practical matter. Inso\u00adfar as the court exercises that de facto authority to resist what it regards as unfair or otherwise abusive settlement terms, it partially rescinds the parties\u2019 power to authoritatively resolve their dispute themselves.[footnote]To the extent class action settlements involve a delegation of state power, see Nagareda, supra note 18, at 191\u201398, courts can similarly rescind that delegation by aggressively exercising their authority under Rule 23(e) to review and approve such settlements. But see, e.g., William B. Rubenstein, The Fairness Hearing: Adversarial and Regulatory Approaches, 53 UCLA L. Rev. 1435, 1443\u201346 (2006) (arguing that judges exercise insufficient oversight of class action settlements). For critical accounts of the role judges play in policing non-class \u201caggregate settlements,\u201d see generally Howard M. Erichson, The Role of the Judge in Non-Class Settlements, 90 Wash. U. L. Rev. 1015 (2013); David M. Jaros &amp; Adam S. Zimmerman, Judging Aggregate Settlement, 94 Wash. U. L. Rev. 545 (2017). But see Andrew Bradt &amp; D. Theodore Rave, The Information-Forcing Role of the Judge in Multidistrict Litigation, 105 Calif. L. Rev. 1259, 1259 (2017) (urging judges to perform an \u201cinformation-forcing\u201d function in non-class aggregate settlements); Linda S. Mullenix, Policing MDL Non-Class Settlements: Empowering Judges Through the All Writs Act 1\u20132 (Pub. Law &amp; Legal Theory Research Paper Series, Paper No. 572, 2017), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2898980 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (defending judicial involvement in non-class aggregate settlements under the All Writs Act).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMany civil procedure scholars\u2014including many of the proponents of the delegation critique\u2014<em>criticize<\/em> this kind of judicial involvement in settlement negotiations for, among other things, potentially pressuring weaker parties to relinquish their right to their day in court.[footnote]See supra note 131; see also Bone, Who Decides?, supra note 132, at 2012\u201314 (identifying other potential problems with judicial involvement in settlement negotiations).[\/footnote] That is a legitimate concern, but viewing such involvement as a delegation-policing strategy shows it to be much less pernicious, and even salutary. Given that most parties are going to settle with or without the court\u2019s approval, we should welcome judicial involvement in ordinary settle\u00adments as a way for the state to reassert control over its coercive adjudica\u00adtory power when that power stands to be abused by the private parties to whom it has been delegated.\r\n\r\nBeyond these transsubstantive delegation-rescinding strategies, vari\u00adous subject-matter-specific procedural rules can similarly be understood as ways of reasserting state control over delegated powers, particularly the prosecutorial power, in cases of abuse. Consider the provision of the False Claims Act (FCA) that allows the federal government to intervene in and take over the prosecution of a qui tam action.[footnote]See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03730(b) (2012).[\/footnote] At first glance, that provision seems to simply reflect the fact that, in a qui tam action, the federal government is the real party in interest, while the private relator is a mere stand-in seeking to vindicate the government\u2019s interests. Given this structure, the FCA\u2019s intervention provision appears to allow the government to prosecute fraud directly in cases in which private enforcement proves inadequate. And that is indeed the provision\u2019s pri\u00admary purpose, but not its sole one. The FCA makes clear that the govern\u00adment does not automatically displace the relator when it intervenes; the relator retains a (minimal) stake even after the government has inter\u00advened and taken over the action.[footnote]See, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(1) (providing that the relator generally \u201cshall have the right to continue as a party to the action\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(2)(A) (providing that a qui tam action cannot be dismissed at the government\u2019s behest without first giving the relator an opportunity to be heard); id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(2)(B) (imposing a similar hearing requirement for settlements); id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(3) (permitting the relator to proceed with the action even if the government declines to do so).[\/footnote] The statute further recognizes that the relator\u2019s stake includes a degree of prosecutorial control over the action and that the relator can abuse that control by exercising it for improper purposes. Most notably, the statute authorizes the court to limit, at the government\u2019s request, the relator\u2019s participation in the action in various ways\u2014not just to avoid unnecessary expense and pro\u00admote effi\u00adciency but also when the relator is acting for \u201cpurposes of harassment.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a03730(c)(2)(C)\u2013r(D).[\/footnote] This suggests another (if secondary) purpose served by government intervention in qui tam actions: reclaiming the delegated prosecutorial power for state officials in cases of abuse.[footnote]For empirical evidence regarding Department of Justice (DOJ) intervention practices that is potentially consistent with this hypothesis, see generally David Freeman Engstrom, Public Regulation of Private Enforcement: Empirical Analysis of DOJ Oversight of Qui Tam Litigation Under the False Claims Act, 107 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1689 (2013). Engstrom identifies the FCA\u2019s intervention provision as an agency litigation gatekeeping strategy that is \u201caffirmative,\u201d \u201cbinding,\u201d and \u201cretail,\u201d with \u201cactive displacement\u201d and \u201cstrong control rights.\u201d Engstrom, Litigation Gatekeepers, supra note 48, at 646 tbl.2. For other variations on this policing strategy, see id. at 650\u201354.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEach of the foregoing delegation-policing strategies rescinds the delegated power at issue and substitutes a state official for the private party who abused that power. But the state can also rescind a delegation without substitution, terminating the party\u2019s action rather than allowing the action to continue under government supervision. For example, federal courts may dismiss a complaint sua sponte, without waiting for the defendant to appear and file a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12\u2014though only when the claims are patently frivo\u00adlous and only after affording the plaintiff certain procedural protections, such as notice, an opportunity to be heard, and leave to amend her complaint.[footnote]See 5B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a01357, at 409 &amp; n.4 (3d ed. 2004).[\/footnote] A sua sponte dismissal effectively rescinds the delegated power to coercively hale others into court, thereby preempting a plain\u00adtiff\u2019s (perceived) abuse of that power before she has managed to inflict any serious harm.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, but more controversially, the Prison Litigation Reform Act authorizes federal courts to dismiss sua sponte an action brought by a prisoner challenging prison conditions if the action, among other things, \u201cis frivolous, malicious, [or] fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d[footnote]42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01997e(c)(1) (2012); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01915A(b)(1) (2012).[\/footnote] What is more, under the so-called three-strikes rule, a prisoner generally may not be granted in forma pauperis status if, on three or more prior occasions, he filed an action or appeal that was dis\u00admissed on any of those grounds.[footnote]28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01915(g).[\/footnote] Given the limited financial resources of most prisoners, that is typically tantamount to <em>permanently<\/em> revoking a prisoner\u2019s power to prosecute claims in federal court. One need not countenance the application of this rule to prisoner litigation in parti\u00adcular in order to recognize it as an example of a more general strategy that, along with other rescissory doctrines, allows the state to respond to ongoing abuse of delegated procedural powers.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Withholding Enforcement<\/em>. \u2014 Of course, rescinding a delegated state power works as a delegation-policing strategy only insofar as a private party\u2019s abuse of that power is not yet complete. It does little good to rescind the summonsing power after the plaintiff has haled the defendant into court, or the subpoena power after a party has issued a subpoena, or the settlement power after the parties have stipulated to a dismissal. In each of those cases, one private party has already exercised the state\u2019s coercive power over another. So rather than seek to <em>undo<\/em> that exercise of coercion (which is impossible), the state must try to <em>limit<\/em> its effects. A number of doctrines aim to do exactly that by allowing the state to avoid facilitating, or giving further effect to, an abusive exercise of delegated power.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, this strategy does not figure prominently in the prosecution context. Because a summons issues automatically once the plaintiff presents it to the court clerk,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(b).[\/footnote] the state cannot refuse to enforce the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of the summonsing power; it has little opportunity to spare the defendant from having to appear and answer the complaint, on pain of default. The best the state can do in most cases is to dismiss the complaint after the defendant has appeared and thereby deny the plaintiff access to additional state powers, particularly those relating to discovery.[footnote]It can also punish the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of the prosecutorial power with sanctions, a strategy considered below. See infra section II.B.3.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe state can, by contrast, more effectively avoid facilitating a party\u2019s abuse of the various discovery powers. If a party makes an abusive discov\u00adery request and, after the other party refuses, moves to compel,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a).[\/footnote] the court cannot undo the coercion the moving party has already exercised. It can, however, limit the effects of that coercion by denying the motion to compel. The opposing party still must affirmatively resist the request and oppose the motion (or preemptively move for a protective order before the motion has been filed), but at least she won\u2019t have to actually turn over the requested information. The same is true when a court grants a motion to quash a subpoena.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3).[\/footnote] By refusing in each case to lend the state\u2019s support to a party\u2019s abusive exercise of delegated coercive power during discovery, the court avoids compounding the abuse.[footnote]Similarly, even as it delegates the state\u2019s power to reach binding resolutions of private disputes, see supra note 111, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375 (1994), at least theoretically gives federal courts a kind of de facto review power over settlement agreements that they would otherwise lack. For if the parties are not completely diverse and want their agreement to be enforceable in federal court, they will have to persuade the court either to retain jurisdiction over the agreement or to incorporate it into the order dismissing the case. That effectively empowers the court to condition federal jurisdiction over a future enforcement action on a fair agreement and, conversely, to refuse to lend support to an agreement it deems unfair by refusing jurisdiction. Although proponents of the delegation critique of arbitration have been somewhat wary of <em>Kokkonen<\/em>, see, e.g., Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 627, the case creates space for a delegation-policing strategy in an area where parties otherwise enjoy nearly unfettered discretion.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile one finds examples of this delegation-policing strategy at the core of the Federal Rules, it is even more prominent in other parts of the procedure canon. Perhaps the clearest example is <em>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.<\/em>, in which the Supreme Court extended the constitutional ban on race-based peremptory challenges in the selection of criminal juries to civil cases[footnote]500 U.S. 614, 618\u201328 (1991).[\/footnote]\u2014so-called civil <em>Batson<\/em>.[footnote]Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986) (establishing a constitutional ban on race-based peremptory challenges in criminal cases).[\/footnote] Because the constitutional guarantee of equal protection applies only to \u201cstate action,\u201d[footnote]<em>Edmonson<\/em>, 500 U.S. at 619.[\/footnote] the key issue in <em>Edmonson<\/em> was whether a private litigant (or her lawyer) could be considered a state actor in exercising peremptory challenges against prospective jurors. The Court applied a two-pronged test to resolve that question and found the first prong\u2014whether a peremptory challenge is \u201ca right or privilege having its source in state authority\u201d[footnote]Id. at 620.[\/footnote]\u2014to be easily met, given that peremptory challenges are available only insofar as the government chooses to authorize them.[footnote]See id. at 620\u201321.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs for the second prong\u2014\u201cwhether a private litigant in all fairness must be deemed a government actor in the use of peremptory chal\u00adlenges\u201d\u2014the Court considered the extent to which the peremptory challenge is imbued with public authority.[footnote]Id. at 621.[\/footnote] Peremptory challenges, the Court noted, depend on \u201cthe overt, significant participation of the government,\u201d from the government\u2019s general administration of the jury system to the court\u2019s involvement in voir dire.[footnote]Id. at 622\u201324.[\/footnote] But more relevant for this Article\u2019s argument, the Court also emphasized that litigants exercise peremptory challenges in the course of discharging \u201ca traditional func\u00adtion of the government\u201d: selecting the members of the jury, a govern\u00admental body.[footnote]Id. at 624.[\/footnote] The peremptory challenge, in other words, is one aspect of a \u201cdelegated\u201d state power.[footnote]See id. at 626\u201328.[\/footnote] And the Court clearly saw litigants as abusing that delegation when they exercise peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.\r\n\r\nThe Court\u2019s refusal to enforce race-based peremptory challenges can accordingly be seen as a delegation-policing strategy akin to the strategy available to courts under the discovery rules. Like a discovery request, a peremptory challenge ultimately depends on court enforce\u00adment to be fully effective.[footnote]See id. at 624 (noting that \u201c[w]ithout the direct and indispensable participation of the judge, who beyond all question is a state actor, the peremptory challenge system would serve no purpose\u201d).[\/footnote] As the Court put it in <em>Edmonson<\/em>, in exercising a peremp\u00adtory challenge, a litigant \u201cinvokes the formal authority of the court, which must discharge the prospective juror.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] <em>Edmonson<\/em> retained the baseline rule that courts will automatically dis\u00adcharge a prospective juror in response to a peremptory challenge, thus preserving the delegation of state power involved in such challenges. But the decision also created room for courts to withhold the state\u2019s support from abusive exercises of that delegated power by refusing to discharge a prospective juror in response to a race-based peremptory challenge. Although the state cannot undo the harm inherent in a discriminatory peremptory challenge, it can avoid facilitating that discrimination and thereby limit the extent of a party\u2019s abuse of delegated state power.\r\n\r\nA similar delegation-policing strategy emerges from a series of Supreme Court decisions over the latter third of the twentieth century concerning the constitutionality of State prejudgment attachment and replevin statutes. In those decisions, the Court repeatedly invalidated laws that allowed a creditor\u2013plaintiff to invoke state assistance in seizing property possessed by the debtor\u2013defendant based on the plaintiff\u2019s conclusory assertion of an interest in the property.[footnote]See Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 18 (1991) (invalidating a Connecticut statute that allowed a plaintiff to attach real estate owned by the defendant during a pending lawsuit simply upon filing a statement of \u201cprobable cause\u201d and posting a bond, without first affording the defendant notice or an opportunity to be heard); N. Ga. Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 606\u201307 (1975) (invalidating a Georgia statute that allowed a plaintiff to garnish the defendant\u2019s assets during a pending lawsuit simply upon filing a conclusory affidavit and posting a bond, without first affording the defendant an opportunity to be heard); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 96 (1972) (invalidating Florida and Pennsylvania summary replevin statutes that allowed any private party to seize personal property that she alleged to be wrongfully held by the possessor simply upon the posting of a bond, without first affording the possessor any notice or an opportunity to be heard); Sniadach v. Family Fin. Corp. of Bay View, 395 U.S. 337, 341\u201342 (1969) (invalidating a Wisconsin garnishment statute that allowed a creditor to temporarily freeze the wages of the debtor pending the outcome of the garnishment action simply by serving the summons, without first affording the debtor any notice or an opportunity to be heard).[\/footnote] Although the formal legal question in each case was whether the lack of an adversarial predeprivation hearing violated procedural due process,[footnote]See <em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 9; <em>Di-Chem<\/em>, 419 U.S. at 603; <em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 80; <em>Sniadach<\/em>, 395 U.S. at 338.[\/footnote] the Court could not straightforwardly apply its standard due process analysis, since the government had not initiated the seizure. The Court instead had to consider the permissibility of \u201cenabling an individual to enlist the aid of the State to deprive another of his or her property by means of the prejudgment attachment or similar procedure.\u201d[footnote]<em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 9.[\/footnote] This was essentially a question of the propriety of delegating state power.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, each of the statutes invalidated by the Court resembled the delegations considered in Part I, in that a private party could get the state to deploy its coercive power for her own purposes more or less on her own say-so and without meaningful judicial review. As the Court explained in one of the decisions, \u201c[t]he statutes\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. abdicate effective state control over state power. Private parties, serving their own private advantage, may unilaterally invoke state power to replevy goods from another.\u201d[footnote]<em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 93.[\/footnote] This structure mirrors that of the delegations involved in a summons or discovery subpoena.[footnote]To be sure, the Court later made clear that a statute does not delegate state power simply by licensing self-help. See Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 157 (1978) (noting that the \u201ctotal absence of overt official involvement plainly distinguishes this case from earlier decisions imposing procedural restrictions on creditors\u2019 remedies\u201d); cf. Andrew S. Gold, Private Rights and Private Wrongs, 115 Mich. L. Rev. 1071, 1074\u201380 (2017) (arguing that the law sometimes allows self-help, and in such cases, the person engaging in self-help is enforcing her own rights, not exercising state power). But a subsequent decision held that there is a delegation of state power \u201cwhenever officers of the State act jointly with a creditor in securing the property in dispute,\u201d which is the case \u201cwhen the State has created a system whereby state officials will attach property on the ex parte application of one party to a private dispute.\u201d Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 932\u201333, 942 (1982) (construing the phrase \u201cunder color of state law\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 but treating that issue as more or less synonymous with the constitutional state action inquiry); cf. Zo\u00eb Sinel, De-Ciphering Self-Help, 67 U. Toronto L.J. 31, 58 n.70 (2017) (arguing that \u201creplevin is not self-help\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn all but one of the cases in which the Court found a delegation of state power, it deemed the delegation impermissible and invalidated the statute at issue because the State had failed to maintain adequate control over its coercive power.[footnote]See, e.g., <em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 91\u201394.[\/footnote] Those decisions can thus be understood as <em>prohibiting<\/em> delegations of state power when there were insufficient checks on how private parties exercised that power.\r\n\r\nThe Court instead pursued a delegation-<em>policing<\/em> strategy in the one decision in which it both found state action under a repossession statute and upheld the statute as consistent with due process. In <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co.<\/em>, the Court sustained a Louisiana statute that allowed a creditor, on ex parte application to a judge, to provisionally sequester personal property held by the debtor subject to a vendor\u2019s lien.[footnote]416 U.S. 600, 618\u201319 (1974).[\/footnote] The Court distinguished its prior decisions invalidating similar statutes on multiple grounds but emphasized in particular that the predeprivation hearing, though ex parte, was before a judge rather than a court clerk or other ministerial official, and that the creditor had to submit a sworn affidavit setting out the specific factual allegations entitling her to possession of the property.[footnote]See id. at 607\u201310, 616\u201317; see also N. Ga. Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, 419 U.S. 601, 607 (1975) (distinguishing a Georgia garnishment statute from the statute at issue in <em>Mitchell<\/em> on the ground that it required only a conclusory affidavit to be filed with the clerk). The Court also noted that the questions to be resolved by the judge concerned \u201cuncomplicated matters that lend themselves to documentary proof.\u201d <em>Mitchell<\/em>, 416 U.S. at 609.[\/footnote] Notwithstanding these differences, it still makes sense to view the Louisiana statute as delegating state power. After all, the predep\u00adrivation judicial review provided by the statute, while perhaps more than \u201ca mere ministerial act,\u201d[footnote]<em>Mitchell<\/em>, 416 U.S. at 616 n.12.[\/footnote] did not amount to that much more. \u201cSince the procedure\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is completely <em>ex parte<\/em>,\u201d Justice Stewart explained in dissent, the judge \u201ccan do little more than determine the formal suffi\u00adciency of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations before ordering the state agents to take the goods from the defendant\u2019s possession.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 629, 632 (Stewart, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] The provision for judicial review thus did not eliminate the delegation conferred by the other parts of the statute; the baseline remained virtually automatic enforcement of a creditor\u2019s sequestration request. And yet, the statute did allow the state to police that delegation to some degree, by refusing to lend its support to patently abusive sequestration requests. That limited opportunity for the state to withhold enforcement may well have been insufficient to address all or even most abuse, but it is nevertheless an example of a kind of delegation-policing strategy employed in other parts of civil procedure.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Punishing Abuse<\/em>. \u2014 Besides rescinding a delegation of state power when it is being abused or withholding enforcement to limit the effects of the abuse, the state can punish the private party who commits the abuse with various sanctions after the fact. This delegation-policing strategy tends to be less intrusive than the first two, as it does not attempt to actually interfere with private parties\u2019 exercise of delegated state power; parties can still exercise the delegated power as they will, though they must suffer the consequences for any abuse they perpetrate. Nor, of course, can sanctions undo the abuse.[footnote]In very rare circumstances, civil procedure allows courts to undo an abusive exercise of delegated state power. For example, when a party obtains a final judgment in her favor by fraud or other misconduct, the court may annul the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3).[\/footnote] Yet they do allow the state to dis\u00adavow an abusive exercise of delegated state power by expressing condem\u00adnation of the private party\u2019s conduct.\r\n\r\nThe paradigmatic example of this delegation-policing strategy is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules. Rule 11 authorizes courts to impose sanc\u00adtions on a party or her lawyer for, among other things, \u201cpresenting\u201d a written submission \u201cfor any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unneces\u00adsary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1).[\/footnote] To be sure, \u201cpresenting\u201d written submissions to the court encompasses a broad swath of litigation conduct, including routine adversarial actions that in no way involve an exercise of delegated state power. A party does not, for instance, exercise delegated state power by filing a motion for a prelimi\u00adnary injunction or for summary judgment. Filing a written submission does, however, frequently involve an exercise of delegated state power\u2014most notably, when a plaintiff files a complaint and thereby triggers the issuance of a summons.\r\n\r\nIn punishing parties for taking such actions for an \u201cimproper purpose,\u201d Rule 11 reflects the conception of abuse of delegated state power developed in the previous section. Rule 11, like the rest of civil procedure, grants private parties significant latitude to use delegated state power to pursue private ends; a private purpose is not necessarily an \u201cimproper purpose,\u201d and so does not necessarily render an exercise of delegated state power abusive. At the same time, however, private parties must observe certain public norms in wielding state power, and Rule 11 imposes liability for offending those norms. This allows the state to repu\u00addiate, if not reverse, private parties\u2019 abusive exercises of delegated state power.[footnote]Among the sanctions a court may impose under Rule 11 are nonmonetary sanc\u00adtions and monetary penalties payable either to the court or to the other party. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4). When a court imposes a nonmonetary remedy or a penalty payable to the court, the sanction is purely punitive; when it imposes a penalty payable to the other party (such as an award of costs or attorney\u2019s fees), the sanction is also compensatory.[\/footnote] Especially when it\u2019s too late to rescind the delegation or with\u00adhold enforcement, punishing abuse may be the only practical way for the state to maintain a degree of accountability for the procedural powers it has delegated to private parties.[footnote]Scholars have criticized Rule 11 on various grounds over the decades. Among other criticisms, they have faulted courts for imposing sanctions inconsistently across different categories of parties and have worried that the risk of sanctions deters potential plaintiffs from bringing meritorious lawsuits. See Stephen B. Burbank, The Transformation of American Civil Procedure: The Example of Rule 11, 137 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1925, 1937 (1989); Melissa L. Nelken, Sanctions Under Amended Federal Rule 11\u2014Some \u201cChilling\u201d Problems in the Struggle Between Compensation and Punishment, 74 Geo. L.J. 1313, 1339\u201343 (1986); William W. Schwarzer, Rule 11 Revisited, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 1013, 1015\u201317 (1988). Rule 11 was significantly revised in 1993, largely to address these kinds of concerns. See Carl Tobias, The 1993 Revision of Federal Rule 11, 70 Ind. L.J. 171, 171 (1995). Interestingly, the normative valence of Rule 11 seems to have shifted in recent years, as some scholars now invoke Rule 11 as a preferable alternative to other measures aimed at curbing abusive litigation practices, such as heightened pleading standards. See Spencer, supra note 157, at 1722, 1732\u201333.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCivil procedure employs similarly punitive delegation-policing strat\u00adegies throughout civil litigation. While Rule 11 expressly does not apply to discovery,[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(d).[\/footnote] Rule 26 authorizes courts to sanction a party for any discovery request that is \u201cinterposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of liti\u00adgation.\u201d[footnote]Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(1)(B)(ii), (3). Rule 45 likewise allows courts to sanction a party for issuing and serving a subpoena that \u201cimpos[es] undue burden or expense.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(1).[\/footnote] And pursuant to their inherent powers, federal courts may order a party to pay the other side\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction for \u201cbad-faith\u201d litigation conduct.[footnote]See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 50 (1991).[\/footnote] At least where these sanctions are imposed in connection with an exercise of delegated state power, they constitute an important delegation-policing strategy.\r\n\r\nThe state can sanction abusive exercises of delegated state power not only during the litigation but also through collateral proceedings. Fore\u00admost among the collateral mechanisms are the tort law causes of action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. Like Rule 11, these torts embody the notion of abuse developed in the previous section, in that each imposes tort liability for litigation conduct taken for some \u201cimpro\u00adper purpose\u201d or with \u201cmalice\u201d\u2014instituting a lawsuit in the case of mali\u00adcious prosecution and, depending on the jurisdiction, a wide range of other procedural actions in the case of abuse of process.[footnote]See 3 Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden &amp; Ellen M. Bublick, The Law of Torts \u00a7\u00a0592, at 407\u201315 (2d ed. 2011); id. \u00a7\u00a0594, at 418\u201328.[\/footnote] The action\u00adable abuse, once again, consists in transgressing certain public values in the course of exercising delegated state power rather than merely using such power to pursue some private objective. While it is relatively difficult to prevail on these causes of action,[footnote]For example, in addition to having to prove that the abusive lawsuit was instituted for an improper purpose, a malicious-prosecution plaintiff must prove that the suit was not supported by probable cause and was terminated in her favor. See id. \u00a7\u00a0592, at 407\u201308. A substantial minority of jurisdictions also require malicious-prosecution plaintiffs to show that they suffered some kind of \u201cspecial injury\u201d from the abusive lawsuit. See id. \u00a7\u00a0593, at 415\u201318.[\/footnote] they attach at least some negative consequences to abusive exercises of delegated state power, especially when sanctions during the litigation are unavailable or prove insufficient.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, actions for malicious prosecution or abuse of process are instituted by other private parties, not state officials. So insofar as they con\u00adstitute a punitive delegation-policing strategy, that strategy is only indirect; the delegation-policing function is itself delegated to private parties. This shows that, in contrast to Rule 11 sanctions, the malicious-prosecution and abuse-of-process torts are primarily compensatory and only secondarily puni\u00adtive. Nevertheless, in affording victims of abusive exercises of dele\u00adgated state power some kind of remedy, the state imposes limits on civil procedure\u2019s various delegations.\r\n\r\nFinally, courts can sanction lawyers as well as the parties they rep\u00adresent, both during the litigation and through collateral proceedings. During the litigation, Rule 11 and Rule 26 authorize a court to sanction a party\u2019s lawyer instead of, or in addition to, the party herself.[footnote]See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1), 26(g)(1)(3).[\/footnote] Other provisions are directed exclusively at lawyers, such as a federal statute allowing courts to hold a lawyer partially liable for the opposing side\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs when she \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d[footnote]28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01927 (2012).[\/footnote] Such conduct often involves abusing some of the delegated state powers involved in ordinary civil litigation.[footnote]See, e.g., Apex Oil Co. v. Belcher Co. of N.Y., 855 F.2d 1009, 1019\u201320 (2d Cir. 1988) (holding that \u00a7\u00a01927 applies to discovery abuse).[\/footnote] As for collateral mechanisms, a number of professional ethics rules cover lawyer conduct that can constitute an abuse of delegated state power.[footnote]See, e.g., Model Rules of Prof\u2019l Conduct rs. 1.2(d), 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5(d) (Am. Bar Ass\u2019n 2016).[\/footnote] One of the subsidiary functions of the system of lawyer discipline, it turns out, is policing some of civil procedure\u2019s delegations on behalf of the state. Sanctioning lawyers in all of these various ways makes perfect sense as a delegation-policing strategy insofar as a party has subdelegated a dele\u00adgated state power to her lawyer and the lawyer is at least partially responsible for abusing that power. As with sanctions directed at the par\u00adties, the point is to target the individual who actually abused delegated state power so that the state can distance itself from her misconduct.\r\n<h2>III. Delegation Policing as Complicity Avoidance<\/h2>\r\nConsidering civil procedure\u2019s various delegation-policing doctrines raises the question <em>why<\/em> the state should police the delegated powers in ordinary civil litigation for abuse. At first blush, the answer seems obvious: Especially because state power is coercive power, abuse of delegated state power can cause significant harm to others; the various delegation-policing strategies help to ameliorate, if not prevent, that harm.[footnote]Cf. Davis, supra note 18, at 615\u201321 (arguing that abuse of the delegated power to enforce the law on the government\u2019s behalf can harm third parties in various ways); Metzger, supra note 4, at 1462\u201363 (arguing that abuse of the delegated power to administer govern\u00admental programs on the government\u2019s behalf can unfairly deprive third parties of access to government benefits).[\/footnote] This concern is surely an important part of the story. Indeed, it helps to explain why, from a delegation-policing perspective, many of the doctrines discussed in the previous Part are overbroad, in that they regu\u00adlate not just exercises of delegated state power but adversarial litigation conduct more generally. Those doctrines reflect a generic concern with the harms that can be inflicted through civil litigation, whether by abuse of delegated state power or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSome of the other doctrines, however, have a narrower focus, uniquely targeting exercises of delegated state power, and then only certain kinds of abuse of that power. This Part identifies an additional reason, beyond general harm prevention, for the state to focus on some forms of procedural abuse to the exclusion of others. It argues that the various delegation-policing doctrines reflect not only an other-regarding concern with limiting the harm private parties can suffer from the abuse of delegated state power, but also a self-regarding concern on the part of the state with distancing itself from private wrongdoing that involves the violation of certain public values, so as to preserve its own moral integrity and that of the political community it serves. This Article labels the latter concern \u201ccomplicity avoidance.\u201d[footnote]This concern differs from more familiar anxieties about procedural private ordering\u2019s effects on judicial \u201cintegrity\u201d or \u201clegitimacy\u201d\u2014the worry that private parties\u2019 preferences will displace judges\u2019 independent judgment. See Bone, Party Rulemaking, supra note 38, at 1384\u201397; Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 547\u201351; Dodge, supra note 10, at 764\u201370; cf. Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 419\u201325 (criticizing certain kinds of remedial clauses in contracts on similar grounds).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs with this Article\u2019s account of abuse of delegated state power,[footnote]See supra section II.A.[\/footnote] its account of complicity avoidance is primarily formal rather than substan\u00adtive. This Part seeks to elucidate the general normative structure of the state\u2019s role in facilitating private wrongdoing during civil litigation, not to comprehensively catalog the types of private wrongdoing that threaten to implicate the state and the political community or to specify all the circumstances in which the state has an obligation to extricate itself from those misdeeds.\r\n\r\nSection III.A introduces the concept of complicity avoidance, reveal\u00ading its logic to be immanent in certain corners of civil procedure doctrine, particularly civil <em>Batson<\/em>. Section III.B then shows that state complicity in private wrongdoing is a problem that recurs throughout the law. It considers, in particular, two instances of complicity avoidance beyond civil procedure: the version of the state action doctrine applied in <em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em> and Seana Shiffrin\u2019s revisionist account of the unconscionabi\u00adlity doctrine in contract law. Section III.C defends complicity avoidance as a distinct normative logic that cannot be reduced to the dominant norma\u00adtive logic in civil procedure, procedural due process. Finally, section III.D grounds complicity avoidance in liberal political theory, according to which the state claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of coercive power and exercises that power in the name of the political community. These features of political power raise the moral stakes of delegation, threatening to implicate all of us in private wrongdoing.\r\n<h3>A. Complicity Avoidance in Civil Procedure<\/h3>\r\nIn decisions applying civil procedure\u2019s various delegation-policing doctrines, courts rarely discuss in significant detail the values served by policing delegations for abuse. But when they do, they do not focus exclu\u00ad\u00adsively on the harm suffered by victims of abusive exercises of delegated state power; they also speak of the abuse\u2019s \u201ctainting\u201d or \u201ccorrupting\u201d the civil justice system, or the wrongdoer\u2019s making the court \u201ca party to\u201d the abuse.[footnote]See infra notes 237\u2013238 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Courts also worry, in other words, about the state\u2019s becoming <em>complicit<\/em> in the abuse.\r\n\r\nThis distinct, self-regarding concern is perhaps most explicit in <em>Edmonson<\/em>, the civil <em>Batson<\/em> case. To be sure, the Court acknowledged the personal \u201cinjury to excluded jurors\u201d from discriminatory peremptory chal\u00adl\u00adenges.[footnote]Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 628 (1991).[\/footnote] But also at stake, in the Court\u2019s view, was the state\u2019s own moral integrity. \u201cBy enforcing a discriminatory peremptory challenge,\u201d the Court explained, a \u201ccourt \u2018has not only made itself a party to the [biased act], but has elected to place its power, property and prestige behind the [alleged] discrimination,\u2019\u201d and thus \u201cin a significant way has involved itself with invidious discrimination.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 624 (alterations in original) (quoting Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 725 (1961)); see also id. at 628 (\u201c[R]acial discrimination in the qualification or selection of jurors offends the dignity of persons and the integrity of the courts.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 402 (1991))).[\/footnote] This complicity in private discrimination \u201cmars the integrity of the judicial system and prevents the idea of democratic government from becoming a reality.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 628.[\/footnote] <em>Edmonson<\/em> essentially imposed an obligation on all courts to avoid complicity by refusing to give effect to discriminatory peremptory challenges\u2014that is, by withholding state support from abusive exercises of a delegated state power.\r\n\r\nIn her dissent in <em>Edmonson<\/em>, Justice O\u2019Connor rejected the majority\u2019s broad notion of state responsibility for private wrongdoing in civil litiga\u00adtion. The civil trial, as she saw it, \u201cis by design largely a stage on which private parties may act\u201d;[footnote]Id. at 632 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). But see id. at 633\u201334 (\u201cThe peremptory [challenge] is, by design, an enclave of private action in a government-managed proceeding.\u201d).[\/footnote] the state merely \u201cerects the platform\u201d and \u201cdoes not thereby become responsible for all that occurs on it.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 632; see also id. at 641 (maintaining that \u201cthe performance of a lawyer\u2019s duties in a courtroom\u201d does not constitute state action).[\/footnote] For this alternative conception of the civil trial, Justice O\u2019Connor relied pri\u00admarily on the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Polk County v. Dodson<\/em>, which had held that a public defender does not act \u201cunder color of state law\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983 when executing a lawyer\u2019s traditional \u201cadver\u00adsarial functions.\u201d[footnote]454 U.S. 312, 320 (1981).[\/footnote] A lawyer, the <em>Dodson<\/em> Court reasoned, performs what is \u201cessentially a private function\u201d: \u201cadvancing \u2018the undivided interests of his client.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id. at 318\u201319 (quoting Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U.S. 193, 204 (1979)).[\/footnote] The <em>Edmonson<\/em> majority acknowledged that not every act by a party or her lawyer during civil litigation necessarily constitutes state action.[footnote]See <em>Edmonson<\/em>, 500 U.S. at 627\u201368 (explaining that in most civil cases, \u201cthe initial decision whether to sue at all, the selection of counsel, and any number of ensuing tactical choices in the course of discovery and trial may be without the requisite governmental character to be deemed state action\u201d).[\/footnote] Nonetheless, it viewed the peremptory challenge as not just another \u201cprivate function,\u201d but an exercise of delegated state power that threatened to implicate the state in the grievous moral wrong of racial discrimination.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn fairness, Justice O\u2019Connor had a point when she observed that the peremptory challenge is really not so different from other \u201cadver\u00adsarial act[s]\u201d taken during civil litigation.[footnote]Id. at 642 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting).[\/footnote] To take two examples, sum\u00admonses and subpoenas seem to share the features that, in the <em>Edmonson<\/em> Court\u2019s view, render a peremptory challenge state action: They similarly depend on \u201cthe overt, significant participation of the government,\u201d[footnote]Id. at 622 (majority opinion).[\/footnote] in that each is issued in the name of the court and is backed by the state\u2019s coercive power, and neither seems to be any less of a \u201ctraditional func\u00adtion of the government\u201d[footnote]Id. at 624.[\/footnote] than a peremptory challenge.\r\n\r\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, courts employ the logic of complicity avoidance beyond the state action context and in cases involving proce\u00addural powers other than peremptory challenges. For example, in decisions imposing sanctions under Rule 11 and the discovery rules, courts often describe the abuse of prosecution and discovery-related powers as \u201ctaint\u00ading\u201d or \u201ccorrupting\u201d the justice system or making the court \u201ca party to\u201d or even \u201ccomplicit in\u201d private wrongdoing, and they invoke sanctions as a way of removing that taint.[footnote]See, e.g., Xyngular Corp. v. Schenkel, 200 F. Supp. 3d 1273, 1328 (D. Utah 2016) (\u201cAnything short of dismissal will fail to remove the taint that Schenkel has caused and fail to adequately deter future litigants from engaging in this type of self-help discovery.\u201d); see also Mark v. New Orleans City, No. 15-7103, 2017 WL 2152367, at *6 (E.D. La. May 16, 2017) (acknowledging \u201ccases where courts have\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. noted that the legitimacy of courts is injured when courts are \u2018complicit in allowing these shakedown schemes to continue\u2019\u201d but ultimately declining to impose sanctions under Rule 11 (quoting Doran v. Del Taco, Inc., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1031 (C.D. Cal. 2005))).[\/footnote] Similar rhetoric appears in abuse-of-process and malicious-prosecution decisions.[footnote]See Cordes v. Outdoor Living Ctr., Inc., 781 S.W.2d 31, 34 (Ark. 1989) (likening abuse of process to extortion or coercion, and noting the possibility that the process might be \u201ctainted by a willful act\u201d of one of the parties); Antur Realty Corp. v.

App. Apr. 27, 2001) (explaining that the abuse-of-process tort \u201cdeveloped to provide a remedy in situations where an appropriate legal procedure has been\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. corrupted in order to accomplish some ulterior motive for which a court proceeding was not intended\u201d); see also Kolka v. Jones, 71 N.W. 558, 565\u201366 (N.D. 1897) (\u201cIf the law will not punish such conduct\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the courts themselves will seem to have forsaken their high function as protectors and vindicators of invaded rights, and to have become, instead, the accomplices of evil men.\u201d).[\/footnote] Whether or not the exercise of these other procedural powers formally constitutes state action as a mat\u00adter of constitutional law, courts view the abuse of those powers as breach\u00ading the public\u2013private divide and staining the state\u2019s moral integrity.\r\n\r\nThe notion of complicity in these decisions does not depend on the narrower conception of a delegation articulated by public law scholars such as Davis and Metzger.[footnote]See supra notes 68\u201375, 143\u2013145 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] The state can, in other words, become com\u00adplicit in an abusive exercise of delegated state power even though the private party wielding that power isn\u2019t acting on the government\u2019s behalf or constrained to pursue its purposes. In <em>Edmonson<\/em>, for instance, the Court perceived a threat of complicity, notwithstanding the fact that pri\u00advate par\u00adties may legitimately exercise peremptory challenges for their own ends.[footnote]See <em>Edmonson<\/em>, 500 U.S. at 626 (\u201cThough the motive of a peremptory challenge may be to protect a private interest, the objective of jury selection proceedings is to determine representation on a governmental body.\u201d).[\/footnote] The risk of complicity arises not because private parties are stand\u00ading in for the state but because they are exercising its coercive powers. This means that the state faces a pervasive risk of complicity in civil litiga\u00adtion. Because a private party need not be authorized to act as the state\u2019s agent in order to render it complicit in her wrongdoing, <em>every<\/em> exercise of delegated state power in civil litigation potentially implicates the state\u2019s moral integrity. And because there is a fine line between a legitimate pri\u00advate purpose and an improper one\u2014an aggressive discovery request, for example, can quickly shade into a vexatious one\u2014a significant number of those exer\u00adcises of delegated power will in fact prove to be abusive, and thus, for the state, corrupting.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines only mitigate the threat of complicity rather than eliminate it. They do so to varying degrees. The delegation-rescinding doctrines afford the state the most protection, deeming the risk of complicity too great to allow private parties to continue to exercise state power unsupervised by state officials. The doctrines that withhold enforcement from certain exercises of dele\u00adgated power, by contrast, are somewhat more permissive: They allow pri\u00advate parties to continue to exercise\u2014and thus to abuse\u2014delegated state powers but refuse to lend the state\u2019s support to exercises of those powers that offend especially important public values. Finally, the doctrines that punish abusive exercises of delegated state power tolerate the most complicity, censuring only the worst forms of abuse after they have occurred. Given the limits of the various delegation-policing strategies, the state ends up incurring a good deal of complicity in abusive exercises of delegated power that can be neither thwarted nor repudiated. This is by no means to deny the significant benefits of delegating procedural powers to private parties.[footnote]These benefits are discussed further at infra section III.D.2.[\/footnote] But we should also recognize that those bene\u00adfits come at a considerable moral cost to the state.[footnote]In this respect, civil procedure provides private parties with a moral subsidy\u2014not just the financial subsidy that other scholars have identified. See, e.g., Judith Resnik, Money Matters: Judicial Market Interventions Creating Subsidies and Awarding Fees and Costs in Individual and Aggregate Litigation, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2119, 2131\u201337 (2000) (identifying various taxpayer-financed subsidies for civil litigants); Stephen J. Ware, Is Adjudication a Public Good? \u201cOvercrowded Courts\u201d and the Private Sector Alternative of Arbitration, 14 Cardozo J. Conflict Resol. 899, 900 (2013) (criticizing the civil justice system for squander\u00ading \u201cpublic resources that would be better spent on parties who deserve the subsidy\u201d). I plan to explore this idea further in future work.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. Complicity Avoidance Beyond Civil Procedure<\/h3>\r\nCivil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines represent a distinctly procedural response to a distinctly procedural problem. Ordinary civil litigation delegates a number of procedural powers to private parties. In abusing those powers, private parties can render the state complicit in their wrongdoing. The delegation-policing doctrines, in their different ways, allow the state to avoid that complicity by distancing itself from pri\u00advate parties\u2019 exercises of delegated procedural powers.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the threat of complicity arises from the <em>substance<\/em> of a party\u2019s legal claims. Even when private parties exercise delegated procedural powers scrupulously, they can still jeopardize the state\u2019s moral integrity if they are using civil litigation to seek the state\u2019s support for some objectionable goal and the substantive law entitles them to relief. This different iteration of the complicity problem calls for different, <em>substantive<\/em> complicity-avoidance doctrines\u2014rules of substantive law that alter the content of a given cause of action in a way that thwarts private parties\u2019 attempts to use civil litigation to achieve certain repugnant ends. Attend\u00ading to these doctrines not only reveals a deep connection between procedure and substance but also gives a fuller sense of the kinds of pri\u00advate wrongdoing that trigger complicity concerns. This section considers two substantive complicity-avoidance doctrines: the version of the state action doctrine applied in <em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em> and Seana Shiffrin\u2019s revision\u00adist account of the unconscionability doctrine in contract law.\r\n\r\n<em>Shelley<\/em> held that a State court\u2019s enforcement of a racially restrictive covenant is \u201cstate action\u201d that violates the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.[footnote]Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 14\u201320 (1948).[\/footnote] While the Court relied on precedents holding that official judicial action is state action,[footnote]See id. at 14.[\/footnote] it never clearly explained how private parties\u2019 discriminatory motives can taint a judicial decision. The Court\u2019s reasoning, however, indicates that the constitutional violation in <em>Shelley<\/em> must have amounted to state complicity in private discrimination. The Court never suggested that either of the States involved had itself engaged in any discriminatory conduct. Rather, the State courts had faci\u00adlitated <em>private<\/em> discrimination by giving effect to discriminatory private agreements. Their responsibility for the discrimination was therefore secondary rather than primary. This is reflected in the language of the Court\u2019s opinion, which described the State courts\u2019 enforcement of the restrictive covenants as the \u201c[p]articipation of the State\u201d in private discrimination.[footnote]Id. at 13.[\/footnote] And while acknowledging that \u201cthe particular pattern of discrimination\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. was defined initially by the terms of a private agree\u00adment,\u201d the Court noted that \u201c[t]he judicial action\u201d of enforcing that discrimination \u201cbears the clear and unmistakable imprimatur of the State.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 20.[\/footnote] Such language describes the role of the accomplice, not the principal.\r\n\r\nThe private wrongdoing that the State courts had facilitated was a matter of the substance of the restrictive covenants, rather than anything the parties had done during the litigation to enforce them. The Court accordingly had to look to substantive law to develop a strategy for avoiding state complicity in that wrongdoing. Given that the racially restrictive covenants were enforceable under each State\u2019s common law of property, the Court essentially ordered the States to revise their common law to no longer recognize such agreements,[footnote]See id. at 19, 22.[\/footnote] thereby making the agreements solely a matter of \u201cvoluntary adherence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 13.[\/footnote] By refusing to coercively enforce the racially restrictive covenants, the Court believed, the States could extricate themselves from that private discrimination. That is the logic of complicity avoidance.\r\n\r\nThis account by no means solves the perennial puzzle surrounding <em>Shelley<\/em>: how to cabin its holding to prevent constitutional law from subsuming nearly all of private law. The Supreme Court has itself balked at <em>Shelley<\/em>\u2019s most sweeping implications, significantly reining in the state action doctrine in subsequent decisions.[footnote]See Davis, supra note 18, at 594 n.40 (explaining that <em>Shelley<\/em> was the closest the Court has come to treating \u201cevery private action as state action\u201d but further noting that the Court \u201chas never read that case for all it may be worth\u201d).[\/footnote] But the Court and commenta\u00adtors alike have failed to articulate a coherent, principled basis for limiting <em>Shelley<\/em>\u2019s logic.[footnote]See, e.g., Sunstein, Partial Constitution, supra note 47, at 56, 73 (noting that <em>Shelley<\/em> is \u201cextremely controversial\u201d and that the \u201cpuzzle of the case\u201d lies in the fact that \u201cjudicial enforcement of voluntary agreements is not normally thought to violate the Constitution\u201d); Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1697 (2d ed. 1988) (arguing that the Court\u2019s modern state action decisions \u201cappear peculiarly unpersuasive\u201d in purporting to \u201carticulate and apply an autonomous state action doctrine\u201d); Mark Tushnet, Weak Courts, Strong Rights: Judicial Review and Social Welfare Rights in Comparative Constitutional Law 167 (2008) (explaining that the rule established in <em>Shelley<\/em> can be difficult to apply in other state action cases); cf. Charles L. Black, Jr., The Supreme Court, 1966 Term\u2014Foreword: \u201cState Action,\u201d Equal Protection, and California\u2019s Proposition 14, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 69, 95 (1967) (calling the state action doctrine \u201ca conceptual disaster area\u201d).[\/footnote] In light of that failure, we could simply dismiss <em>Shelley<\/em> as a (necessary and justified) realist aberration, the high-water mark of the Court\u2019s attempt to extend federal judicial oversight over as many discrim\u00adinatory practices as possible. A less ad hoc response would be to accept the full breadth of <em>Shelley<\/em>\u2019s articulation of the state action doctrine and to focus on determining when the state should refuse to lend its support to private wrongdoing. It may be better to candidly acknowledge the extent of the state\u2019s potential involvement in private wrongdoing and to consi\u00adder when the state has a duty to repudiate it than to occlude the moral costs of our commitment to private ordering by simply pretending that the state isn\u2019t implicated.[footnote]Cf. Sunstein, Partial Constitution, supra note 47, at 160 (\u201c<em>Shelley v. Kraemer<\/em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. was a remarkably easy state action case.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The case was difficult only because it is unclear whether the Constitution forbids the state\u2019s apparently neutral use of its courts to enforce contracts, including racially restrictive property agreements.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nRead as a complicity-avoidance decision, <em>Shelley<\/em> identifies a problem that, far from being limited to constitutional law\u2019s state action doctrine, recurs throughout the law. Consider the unconscionability doctrine in contract law, as reconceptualized by Shiffrin.[footnote]See generally Shiffrin, Paternalism, supra note 25. For a recent critique of Shiffrin\u2019s account, see Nicolas Cornell, A Complainant-Oriented Approach to Unconscionability and Contract Law, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1131, 1153\u201357 (2016).[\/footnote] The unconscionability doctrine allows courts to refuse to enforce an otherwise valid contract the terms of which were manifestly unfair or immoral at the time the agree\u00adment was formed.[footnote]See <strong>U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a02-302(1) (Am. Law Inst. &amp; Unif. Law Comm\u2019n 2003); <\/strong>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a0208 (Am. Law Inst. 1981).[\/footnote] Both critics[footnote]See, e.g., Charles Fried, Contract as Promise 104 (1981); Alan Schwartz, A Reexamination of Nonsubstantive Unconscionability, 63 Va. L. Rev. 1053, 1071\u201376 (1977).[\/footnote] and defenders[footnote]See, e.g., Duncan Kennedy, Distributive and Paternalist Motives in Contract and Tort Law, with Special Reference to Compulsory Terms and Unequal Bargaining Power, 41 Md. L. Rev. 563, 631\u201338 (1982); Anthony T. Kronman, Paternalism and the Law of Contracts, 92 Yale L.J. 763, 764 (1983).[\/footnote] of the doctrine have viewed it as paternalistic, since it relieves one of the parties to a con\u00adtract of her freely assumed obligations when they prove to have been unwise. Against this consensus, Shiffrin contends that the unconscionability doc\u00adtrine need not be paternalistic, depending on the state\u2019s motive in deploy\u00ading it. Insofar as the state uses the doctrine simply to protect the weaker party to a contract from the bad consequences of her decision, then it is indeed paternalistic. But that is not the state\u2019s only possible purpose. Instead, the state\u2019s \u201cmotive may reasonably be a self-regarding concern not to facilitate or assist harmful, exploitative, or immoral action.\u201d[footnote]Shiffrin, Paternalism, supra note 25, at 224.[\/footnote] This \u201cself-regarding concern\u201d arises because \u201cthe legal institu\u00adtion of contract requires, through their role in enforcement, the participation and cooper\u00adation of parties outside the agreement\u2014that is, it requires the cooperation of the community, as it is embodied in the state.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 221.[\/footnote] So rather than bespeaking an other-regarding concern for the weaker party\u2019s well-being, the \u201cstate\u2019s refusal to enforce an unconscionable contract could reflect an unwillingness to lend <em>its<\/em> support and its force to assist an exploitative contract because it is an unworthy endeavor to support.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 223\u201330, 249\u201350.[\/footnote] One sees this alternative motivation at work in many of the decisions applying the doctrine, in which \u201ca dominant concern of judges is self-regarding: it is to avoid facilitating the actions of an exploiter rather than to act to protect the disadvantaged party.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 229 (citing illustrative cases).[\/footnote] That, of course, is precisely the same concern as in <em>Shelley<\/em>.[footnote]Shiffrin briefly makes the connection to <em>Shelley<\/em>. See id. at 233 n.34.[\/footnote] Shiffrin thus reconceptualizes unconscionability as a complicity-avoidance doctrine.[footnote]One can give a similar account of other contract law doctrines that allow courts to refuse to enforce private agreements on grounds of \u201cpublic policy.\u201d Beyond contract law, another potential example of a substantive complicity-avoidance doctrine is the equitable \u201cclean hands\u201d defense, which has traditionally been justified as a way for courts to avoid abetting or countenancing private wrongdoing and to thereby preserve their \u201cintegrity.\u201d See Ori J. Herstein, A Normative Theory of the Clean Hands Defense, 17 Legal Theory 171, 176\u201378 (2011). But see id. at 188\u201389 (doubting whether the kinds of wrongdoing that typically trigger the clean hands defense rise to the level of implicating the political community).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile substantive, both <em>Shelley<\/em> and unconscionability respond to the same fundamental problem as civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines. Whether by abusing delegated procedural powers or by seeking public support for their immoral projects, private parties can render the state complicit in their wrongdoing. <em>Shelley<\/em> and unconsciona\u00adbility, just like civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines, enable the state to avoid the worst forms of complicity.\r\n<h3>C. Complicity Avoidance, Not Due Process<\/h3>\r\nIf the logic of complicity avoidance underlies important doctrines in civil procedure (among other legal domains), one might wonder why it has escaped scholarly attention. The neglect may well owe to the hege\u00admony of another normative logic in civil procedure doctrine and scholar\u00adship: procedural due process. In answering almost any procedural question, courts and scholars alike reflexively invoke due process\u2014if not the concept itself, then at least its constituent values, such as fairness and accuracy. Many readers thus might doubt the distinctiveness of complicity avoidance and instead try to assimilate it to due process. There is consid\u00aderable support for such a move, as both courts and commentators have conceptualized delegation problems in other areas of the law in due process terms.[footnote]See, e.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co. 298 U.S. 238, 326, 330\u201332 (1936) (analyzing the validity of the price-setting provisions in the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause); Davis, supra note 18, at 615\u201321 (identifying due process limits on private enforcement of regulatory laws); Lawrence, supra note 42, at 672\u201395 (considering \u201cthe due process approach for handling private delegation\u201d); Rubenfeld, supra note 39, at 11\u201319 (discussing the applicability of the Due Process Clause to Title IX investigations and adjudications conducted by private schools).[\/footnote] Yet, while civil procedure\u2019s delegations of state power can indeed raise significant due process concerns, those concerns hardly exhaust the delegations\u2019 normative significance. Even after accounting for the threat to due process values, there remains the problem of state complicity in abusive exercises of delegated power\u2014a problem that civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines are well tailored to address.\r\n\r\nProcedural due process has two main features, neither of which quite fits the structure of civil procedure\u2019s delegation problem. First, procedural due process reflects an ex ante concern with promoting accuracy in governmental decisionmaking. The Supreme Court has construed the Due Process Clause to require the government to follow certain procedures before depriving people of their property (or, less relevant in the civil context, their lives or liberty).[footnote]See, e.g., Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80 (1972). Thus, the question in the canonical procedural due process cases of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), and Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), was whether recipients of certain federal benefits were entitled to a hearing before the government terminated their benefits.[\/footnote] According to the Court, the purpose of this requirement is \u201cto minimize substantively unfair or mistaken deprivations of property\u201d by the government.[footnote]<em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 81.[\/footnote] Procedural due process thus seeks to prevent erroneous deprivations of property by prescribing procedures that enhance the accuracy of govern\u00admental decisionmaking.[footnote]See, e.g., Lawrence A. Alexander, Cutting the Gordian Knot: State Action and Self-Help Repossession, 2 Hastings Const. L.Q. 893, 917\u201318 (1975) (\u201cThe basic purpose of the procedural due process requirements associated with the right to a hearing on adjudicative facts\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is to minimize error in the finding of adjudicative facts.\u201d). Some scholars have attempted to ground due process in values other than accuracy. See, e.g., Jerry L. Mashaw, Due Process in the Administrative State 158\u2013253 (1985) (developing a dignitarian theory of due process); Lawrence B. Solum, Procedural Justice, 78 S. Cal. L. Rev. 181, 273\u201384 (2004) (arguing that participatory procedures enhance the legitimacy of governmental decisions). These alternative conceptions of due process, however, can still be distinguished from complicity avoidance on the second ground considered in this section.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCivil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines, by contrast, reflect an ex post concern that goes beyond accurate decisionmaking. Even when a civil justice system institutes procedures that reduce the risk of erroneous outcomes to a tolerable level, those procedures will not forestall every abuse of delegated state power. Nor will every kind of abuse compromise the accuracy of the decisionmaking process. Yet civil procedure still employs delegation-policing doctrines, which seek to address abusive exercises of delegated state power as they are occurring or after they have occurred, and irrespective of their effect on the accuracy of the ultimate decision. Traditional notions of due process can\u2019t readily account for that function; complicity avoidance can.\r\n\r\nOnce again, civil <em>Batson<\/em> exemplifies the divergence between civil pro\u00adcedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines and procedural due process. The Court in <em>Edmonson<\/em> admittedly adverted to due process concerns in justifying a ban on racially discriminatory peremptory challenges in civil trials, noting how \u201c[r]ace discrimination within the courtroom raises serious questions as to the fairness of the proceedings conducted there.\u201d[footnote]Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 628 (1991).[\/footnote] It is also true that the traditional justifications for peremptory challenges sound in due process.[footnote]See id. at 633 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cBy allowing the litigant to strike jurors for even the most subtle of discerned biases, the peremptory challenge fosters both the perception and reality of an impartial jury.\u201d).[\/footnote] But <em>Edmonson<\/em>\u2019s holding is both underinclusive and overinclusive with respect to due process values. Rather than specify ex ante various accuracy-undermining bases for making peremptory challenges, the Court subjected peremptory challenges to ex post review solely for discrimination. And rather than permit race-based peremptory challenges that may be grounded in empirically justified generalizations, the Court proscribed all race-based peremptory challenges categori\u00adcally.[footnote]Id. at 630\u201331.[\/footnote] These aspects of <em>Edmonson<\/em>\u2019s holding belie the suggestion that the Court was trying to enhance the overall accuracy of civil jury trials. They instead suggest that the Court was trying to avoid state complicity in pri\u00advate discrimination as such.\r\n\r\nSecond, procedural due process is concerned with <em>direct<\/em> state action, whereas civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines are concerned with <em>indirect <\/em>state action. Due process constrains what the state may do <em>to<\/em> private parties\u2014the delegation-policing doctrines, what it may do <em>for<\/em> private parties. Consider the prejudgment attachment and replevin cases. Those cases were formally adjudicated under the Due Process Clause, and the Court repeatedly emphasized the importance of predeprivation hearings for promoting accurate decisionmaking.[footnote]See, e.g., Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 13 (1991); <em>Fuentes<\/em>, 407 U.S. at 80\u201382.[\/footnote] But the Court also acknowledged that while in those cases \u201cthe inquiry is similar\u201d to the traditional due process analysis, \u201cthe focus is different.\u201d[footnote]<em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 10.[\/footnote] Specifically, \u201c[p]rejudgment remedy statutes ordinarily apply to disputes between private parties rather than between an individual and the government,\u201d and as such \u201care designed to enable one of the parties to \u2018make use of state procedures with the overt, significant assistance of state officials.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Id. at 10\u201311 (quoting Tulsa Prof\u2019l Collection Servs., Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988)).[\/footnote] The state\u2019s role, in other words, is limited to facilitating, rather than directly regulating, private conduct. The Court thus had to gerrymander the three-pronged due process balancing test articulated in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge<\/em>,[footnote]424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).[\/footnote] according \u201cprincipal attention\u201d to \u201cthe interest of the party seeking the prejudgment remedy\u201d rather than to any interest of the government.[footnote]<em>Doehr<\/em>, 501 U.S. at 11.[\/footnote] More than just a minor doctrinal tweak, this modification fundamentally reconfigured the role of the state in the due process analysis. The concept of complicity avoidance makes that reconfiguration seem less ad hoc.\r\n\r\nFor there to be state complicity, of course, there must be some under\u00adlying private wrong for the state to be complicit <em>in<\/em>. And one can indeed conceptualize some of the wrongs addressed by civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines in due process terms, as some involve, or contribute to, an arbitrary deprivation of property. But not all of them. From civil <em>Batson<\/em> to Rule 11 to the abuse-of-process tort, the problem is not that someone was or might be arbitrarily deprived of her property\u2014some of the doctrines can be triggered without any deprivation at all\u2014but that a private party has compromised certain public values in exer\u00adcising state power. In any event, even when the underlying wrong does implicate due process, the state\u2019s role remains only secondary rather than primary. The state does not act of its own initiative but rather lends its coercive apparatus to private parties so they can achieve their own ends. Complicity avoidance provides a distinct normative framework for thinking about the state\u2019s obligations when it has delegated its coercive power to private parties rather than exercising that power itself.\r\n<h3>D. Defending Complicity Avoidance\u2014and Delegation<\/h3>\r\nThe complicity-avoidance logic employed in cases such as <em>Edmonson<\/em> is not just a doctrinal construct. As this section argues, that logic reso\u00adnates with fundamental principles of liberal political theory. The aim, to be clear, is not to provide a definitive defense of complicity avoidance but to show it to be a normatively attractive ideal in light of our legal system\u2019s other commitments. At the same time, complicity avoidance comes at a cost: In attempting to avoid complicity in private wrongdoing, the state forgoes many of the benefits associated with delegating state power to private parties in the first place. The upshot, this section suggests, is that sometimes there are good reasons for the state\u2014and thus the entire politi\u00adcal community\u2014to tolerate a degree of complicity in private wrongdoing.\r\n\r\n1. <em>The Political Theory of Complicity Avoidance<\/em>. \u2014 Civil procedure\u2019s delegations of state power run up against one of the most basic tenets of liberal political theory: that the defining feature of political power is its coerciveness and that the central task of political theory is legitimating and limiting that coercion. Contemporary liberalism proceeds from the premise, most prominently associated with Max Weber, that the modern state claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force.[footnote]See Max Weber, The Profession and Vocation of Politics (1919), reprinted in <em>Weber: Political Writings<\/em> 310 (Peter Lassman &amp; Ronald Speirs eds., 1994).[\/footnote] This premise gives rise to the need to specify the conditions that legitimate the state\u2019s use of coercion, which, in turn, involves identifying limits on the state\u2019s coercive power.[footnote]See, e.g., Ronald Dworkin, Law\u2019s Empire 191 (1986) (describing \u201cthe classical problem of the legitimacy of coercive power\u201d).[\/footnote] These imperatives explain public law\u2019s enduring focus on constraining state action.[footnote]See Amitai Etzioni, Reining in Private Agents, 101 Minn. L. Rev. Headnotes 279, 279 (2016), http:\/\/www.minnesotalawreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Etzioni.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/KCJ8-TAX3] (\u201cThe Constitution and much of statutory law seek to protect individual rights from intrusions by the government. It is the government\u2019s coercive power that must be constrained.\u201d); Daryl J. Levinson, The Supreme Court 2015 Term\u2014Foreword: Looking for Power in Public Law, 130 Harv. L. Rev. 31, 46 &amp; n.79 (2016) (arguing that a primary ambition of constitutionalism is to constrain state power).[\/footnote] They also account for the more recent anxiety about the \u201cprivatization\u201d of various state functions[footnote]See supra notes 1\u20132, 140 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]: If state power is necessarily coercive, and if that power must be subject to certain limits to be legitimate, then delegating state power to private par\u00adties threatens to untether state coercion from its legitimating constraints. All of this is reason enough to carefully attend to civil procedure\u2019s delegations of state power and its delegation-policing doctrines.\r\n\r\nA concern with coercion alone, however, doesn\u2019t fully explain courts\u2019 additional concern with complicity in abusive exercises of delegated state power. To appreciate that further worry, one must understand the special nature of political power in a liberal democracy. The political philosopher John Rawls, synthesizing the liberal social-contract tradition, famously argued that democratic political power is distinctive not just because of its coerciveness but also because of its authorship. \u201c[W]hile political power is always coercive power,\u201d Rawls explained, \u201cin a constitutional regime it is the power of the public, that is, the power of free and equal citizens as a collective body.\u201d[footnote]John Rawls, Political Liberalism 68 (1996) [hereinafter Rawls, Political Liberalism].[\/footnote] In a democracy, in other words, political power is ulti\u00admately \u201ccitizens\u2019 power\u201d[footnote]John Rawls, Justice as Fairness: A Restatement 40\u201341 (Erin Kelly ed., 2001).[\/footnote]\u2014\u201ca power in which all citizens have an equal share.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 183\u201384. This conception of political power differs fundamentally from that of genuine libertarianism (as distinct from \u201cclassical\u201d versions of liberalism), which reduces political power to a \u201cnetwork of private contracts\u201d and accordingly denies the existence of any separate \u201cpublic\u201d realm. Samuel Freeman, Illiberal Libertarians: Why Libertarianism Is Not a Liberal View, 30 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff. 105, 107 (2001). For liberals, by contrast, the establishment of political institutions constitutes a distinct public domain subject to a distinct set of normative principles. Cf. Samuel Scheffler, Membership and Political Obligation, 25 J. Pol. Phil. 3, 16 (2017) (\u201c[T]he very idea of a \u2018public\u2019 is a creation of political society; there is no public in the state of nature.\u201d).[\/footnote] It is thus doubly public: As coercive power, it\u2019s vested with the state, per the monopoly of physical force; and as democratic power, it\u2019s col\u00adlectively authorized by the political community, per the social contract.[footnote]But see James Q. Whitman, Between Self-Defense and Vengeance\/Between Social Contract and Monopoly of Violence, 39 Tulsa L. Rev. 901, 902 (2004) (presenting the social contract and monopoly of violence as two opposing theories of the state).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis means that the political community has a lot riding, morally speaking, on how the state exercises its coercive power. As Arthur Ripstein has explained, because political power in a democracy is authorized by the political community as a whole, the state speaks in the name of the political community whenever it exercises power through any of its institutions.[footnote]See Arthur Ripstein, Private Order and Public Justice: Kant and Rawls, 92 Va. L. Rev. 1391, 1435 (2006) [hereinafter Ripstein, Private Order].[\/footnote] That includes when courts resolve private disputes through civil litigation, which is among those \u201cprocedures and institutions [that] can decide to act on behalf of everyone.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1428; see also Ripstein, Private Wrongs, supra note 51, at 289 (\u201cA court resolving a private dispute purports to speak from\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a public standpoint\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 420 (\u201c[T]he judiciary serves as the community\u2019s voice, levying its response to an abrogation of a publicly recognized responsibility.\u201d).[\/footnote] The political community thus bears ultimate responsibility for how the state exercises its coercive power, including how its courts adjudicate private disputes.[footnote]See Ripstein, Private Order, supra note 282, at 1435.[\/footnote] And when the state abuses its power, the political community becomes complicit in that wrongdoing.[footnote]For more on the idea that the citizens of a democracy collectively authorize, and thus bear responsibility for, many of the acts of their government, see generally Eric Beerbohm, In Our Name: The Ethics of Democracy (2012); John M. Parrish, Collective Responsibility and the State, 1 Int\u2019l Theory 119 (2009); Anna Stilz, Collective Responsibility and the State, 19 J. Pol. Phil. 190 (2011). But see Robert Jubb, Participation in and Responsibility for State Injustices, 40 Soc. Theory &amp; Prac. 51, 52\u201353 (2014) (criticizing this idea).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nYet the liberal account of political power has much more sweeping implications for the civil justice system than liberal political theorists have appreciated. They tend to equate exercises of state power in civil litiga\u00adtion with judicial action, and thus assume that the political community\u2019s complicity extends only as far as the decisions of courts. But as this Article has shown, the state doesn\u2019t maintain exclusive control over its coercive power in civil litigation. To be sure, as liberal political theorists have rightly emphasized, the main point of a civil justice system is to provide authoritative, <em>public<\/em> resolutions of private disputes.[footnote]See Ripstein, Private Order, supra note 282, at 1415\u201329.[\/footnote] Along the way, though, the state permits <em>private<\/em> parties to exercise various procedural powers.[footnote]See supra section I.B.[\/footnote] As coercive powers of a democratic state, those powers are still authorized by the members of the political community and exercised in their name. The political community thus remains collectively respon\u00adsible for how private parties exercise the delegated state powers during civil litigation. Given the nature of democratic political power and the division of labor between private parties and courts in civil litigation, the complicity that concerns courts in cases such as <em>Edmonson<\/em> turns out to be not just the complicity of the state but the complicity of us all.[footnote]This Article\u2019s complicity-avoidance theory of civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines shares certain affinities with Malcolm Thorburn\u2019s public law theory of criminal law\u2019s justification defenses. See Malcolm Thorburn, Criminal Law as Public Law, <em>in<\/em> Philosophical Foundations of Criminal Law 21 (R.A. Duff &amp; Stuart P. Green eds., 2011); Malcolm Thorburn, Justifications, Powers, and Authority, 117 Yale L.J. 1070, 1118 (2008) [hereinafter Thorburn, Justifications]. But whereas Thorburn focuses on emergency situations in which private parties must temporarily \u201cstand in\u201d for state officials, see Thorburn, Justifications, supra, at 1076, 1107, 1118, 1125\u201326, this Article contends that civil procedure delegates coercive state power to private parties on a continuing, rather than emergency, basis, and that private parties don\u2019t \u201cstand in\u201d for the state but rather are permitted to use delegated state power primarily for their own purposes.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2. <em>Balancing Complicity Avoidance and Delegation<\/em>. \u2014 If the political community can indeed become complicit in private exercises of delegated state power during civil litigation, then perhaps we should just eliminate the risk of complicity by eliminating the delegations. Rather than delegate the state\u2019s coercive prosecutorial, investigatory, and adjudi\u00adcatory powers to potentially faithless private parties, the safer course might be to vest those powers exclusively with more accountable governmental officials. And yet, while civil procedure\u2019s delegations entail significant moral costs for the state\u2014much more significant than civil procedure scholars have appreciated\u2014they also promise significant benefits. Those benefits counsel against eliminating civil procedure\u2019s delegations and in favor of taking the very approach civil procedure in fact takes: delegating many of the state\u2019s procedural powers to private parties but policing those delegations for abuse.\r\n\r\nMany of the benefits of civil procedure\u2019s delegations have been well canvassed in the literature and are present across the civil docket, both in private law and public law cases. In private law cases, delegating the civil prosecutorial power to private parties empowers the victims of private wrongs to directly vindicate their rights[footnote]This is one of the main insights of civil recourse theory. See Goldberg &amp; Zipursky, Torts as Wrongs, supra note 50, at 981\u201382 (arguing that civil recourse \u201cenables individuals to assert claims as a matter of right without first obtaining the permission or blessing of government officials\u201d); cf. Nagareda, supra note 18, at 191 (\u201cIn general, one of the advantages of civil litigation lies in the ability of a private person to lodge a complaint in a manner independent from the government.\u201d).[\/footnote] and reposes prosecutorial discretion with those individuals who experience the costs and benefits of civil litigation most acutely.[footnote]See Shiffrin, Remedial Clauses, supra note 6, at 433 (\u201c[W]ith the duties of \u2018private\u2019 law, because private parties bear the brunt of their burdens as well as the effects of their violation, we generally assign private parties the power to pursue their vindication, despite the underlying, concomitant public interest.\u201d).[\/footnote] In cases with a public law dimension, schol\u00adars have recognized a number of additional benefits associated with the private enforcement of federal statutes, mostly stemming from various practical advantages that private parties enjoy over administrative agencies, including less vulnerability to capture, stronger enforcement incentives, more resources, and greater access to information.[footnote]For a good overview of these benefits, see Clopton, Redundant, supra note 14, at 308\u201311; see also, e.g., Pamela H. Bucy, Private Justice, 76 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 54\u201360 (2002) (considering the investigative and informational advantages of private parties); Stephen B. Burbank, Sean Farhang &amp; Herbert M. Kritzer, Private Enforcement, 17 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 637, 662\u201367 (2013) (evaluating commonly made arguments regarding the benefits of private enforcement, including increasing prosecutorial resources, shifting costs from public to private sources, and \u201cfacilitat[ing] participatory and democratic governance\u201d); Margaret H. Lemos &amp; Max Minzner, For-Profit Public Enforcement, 127 Harv. L. Rev. 853, 912\u201313 (2014) (noting that \u201c[f]inancial incentives blur the line between public and private enforcement\u201d); Matthew C. Stephenson, Public Regulation of Private Enforcement: The Case for Expanding the Role of Administrative Agencies, 91 Va. L. Rev. 93, 106\u201320 (2005) (discussing the potential advantages and disadvantages of private enforcement). Scholars have ascribed similar benefits to party-driven discovery. See, e.g., Carrington, supra note 96, at 55 (suggesting that discovery has helped to enable private enforcement and reduce demand for government or bureaucratic intervention); Miller, Simplified Pleading, supra note 77, at 356 (arguing that limits on discovery should be calibrated so as to preserve \u201cthe civil enforcement role\u201d performed by private litigation). Beyond practical considerations, private enforcement responds to Americans\u2019 traditional ideological distrust of governmental power. See generally Robert Kagan, Adversarial Legalism: The American Way of Law (2001) (connecting the United States\u2019 preference for private enforcement to Americans\u2019 suspicion of the state).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDelegating state power has another set of interrelated benefits that have more to do with political morality than efficient policy implementa\u00adtion. Scholars have explored these benefits in the context of settlement and various forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), but they seem to apply to the private exercise of other state procedural powers as well. Most directly, delegating state procedural powers to private parties pro\u00admotes individual autonomy by giving individuals some say over the resolution of their disputes.[footnote]See Carrie Menkel-Meadow, Whose Dispute Is It Anyway?: A Philosophical and Democratic Defense of Settlement (in Some Cases), 83 Geo. L.J. 2663, 2692 (1995) (\u201cSettlements that are in fact consensual represent the goals of democratic and party-initiated legal regimes by allowing the parties themselves to choose processes and outcomes for dispute resolution.\u201d); see also Edward Brunet, The Core Values of Arbitration, <em>in<\/em> Edward Brunet et al., Arbitration Law in America: A Critical Assessment 3 (2006) (making a similar autonomy-based argument for arbitration).[\/footnote] Because of civil procedure\u2019s delegations, private parties can (within wide limits) delineate the contours of their dispute in terms of claims and parties, decide how much and what kinds of information they will exchange with each other during discovery, and even set the terms of any resolution itself through settlement. This autonomy, in turn, promises two further benefits. First, rather than stoke atomism, allowing private parties to exercise the state\u2019s procedural powers might actually foster communal solidarity, on the theory that people develop a closer attachment to the law by enforcing it them\u00adselves.[footnote]See Menkel-Meadow, supra note 292, at 2688\u201389 (arguing that settlement can allow for greater participation, and thus a closer connection to the law, than litigation); cf. Jody Freeman, Extending Public Law Norms Through Privatization, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1285, 1285 (2003) (arguing that \u201cprivatization can be a means of \u2018publicization,\u2019 through which private actors increasingly commit themselves to traditionally public goals\u201d).[\/footnote] Second, delegation is also a way for the state to accommodate pluralism. Some members of a liberal political community will inevitably espouse values different from those embodied in the law and other political institutions.[footnote]This results from what Rawls called the \u201cfact of reasonable pluralism.\u201d Rawls, Political Liberalism, supra note 278, at 36.[\/footnote] By delegating its procedural powers, the state gives private parties space to express those values in the course of resolving their disputes.[footnote]See Menkel-Meadow, supra note 292, at 2672\u201378 (arguing that settlement allows disputes to be decided according to values other than those embodied in the law); see also Robert M. Ackerman, Disputing Together: Conflict Resolution and the Search for Community, 18 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 27, 67\u201369 (2002) (identifying various communitarian benefits of arbitration). This is one of the main justifications given for religious arbitration and, more generally, arbitration of disputes between the members of a close-knit community. See, e.g., Michael A. Helfand, Arbitration\u2019s Counter-Narrative: The Religious Arbitration Paradigm, 124 Yale. L.J. 2994, 3010\u201322 (2015) (discussing how arbitration can \u201cadvance a shared set of objectives and values\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn light of delegation\u2019s benefits, the state might be drawn toward the opposite extreme. Rather than avoid complicity in private wrongdoing by eliminating civil procedure\u2019s delegations and exercising all coercive procedural powers itself, the state might try to get out of the dispute-resolution business altogether, leaving it exclusively to private ordering.[footnote]Cf. Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 644 (considering a \u201cmodel of disengage\u00adment\u201d whereby judges would extricate themselves from settlement negotiations).[\/footnote] This strategy, however, runs up against another core liberal commitment: the state\u2019s obligation to provide a forum for the authoritative resolution of private disputes.[footnote]See supra note 286 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Radin, Threat, supra note 46, at 295\u201397 (describing liberalism\u2019s conception of the state\u2019s role in resolving private disputes).[\/footnote] Indeed, liberalism has traditionally viewed the adju\u00addication of private disputes as a way to augment the state\u2019s authority and enhance its legitimacy.[footnote]See, e.g., Stephen Holmes, The Anatomy of Antiliberalism 201\u201310 (1993); cf. Judith Resnik &amp; Dennis E. Curtis, Representing Justice: Invention, Controversy, and Rights in City-States and Democratic Courtrooms 338 (2011) (showing how throughout history courthouses and other sites of public dispute resolution have symbolized state authority).[\/footnote] Liberalism thus creates a dilemma for the state: If the state attempts to avoid complicity in private wrongdoing by exercising all coercive power itself, it forgoes the considerable benefits of delegation; but if it attempts to avoid complicity by completely out\u00adsourcing dispute resolution, it shirks its role as final arbiter.\r\n\r\nThis Article does not attempt to resolve that dilemma. Neither the delegation framework developed in Parts I and II nor the complicity-avoidance theory developed in this Part can tell us exactly how much power a civil justice system <em>should<\/em> delegate to private parties. Given all the competing imperatives, however, it does seem that our current civil justice system strikes a reasonable balance. Civil procedure\u2019s delegations realize a number of practical and moral benefits for individual litigants and the political community at large, while its delegation-policing doctrines help the political community to avoid becoming complicit in the worst forms of abuse of those delegations. One can, of course, readily envision perfectly legitimate civil justice systems that strike a different balance\u2014either delegating less state power to private parties to avoid even more complicity in private wrongdoing or delegating even more state power to better promote autonomy and accommodate pluralism. The important point is to recognize the tradeoff between complicity avoidance and other important values served by the delegation of state power. Our civil justice system accepts a significant degree of public complicity in private wrongdoing for the sake of those other values, rather than seeking to minimize any threat to the political community\u2019s moral integrity by maintaining exclusive state control over coercive state power.\r\n<h2>IV. Toward a Delegation-Policing Approach to Arbitration<\/h2>\r\nThe analytical framework developed in the previous Parts can shed light on several procedural debates, both within ordinary civil litigation and beyond it. Within ordinary civil litigation, this Article\u2019s delegation framework simultaneously highlights some of the benefits and drawbacks of current procedural practice. For example, although judges enjoy substantial discretion to police discovery abuse, there is a widespread impres\u00adsion that they rarely exercise it, with the result that discovery often ends up devolving into a \u201cfree-for-all.\u201d[footnote]Pollis, supra note 91, at 2099.[\/footnote] The delegation framework sug\u00adgests that judges can respond to such problems (insofar as they\u2019re real problems)[footnote]Cf. Danya Shocair Reda, The Cost-and-Delay Narrative in Civil Justice Reform: Its Fallacies and Functions, 90 Or. L. Rev. 1085, 1088\u201390 (2012) (arguing that the costs of discovery are exaggerated); Spencer, supra note 157, at 1730 (same).[\/footnote] by more aggressively policing discovery for abuse ex post, in contrast to the recent amendments to the discovery rules, which focus on limiting the scope of discovery ex ante.[footnote]See supra note 91 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe delegation framework also speaks to delegations of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers outside ordinary civil litigation. Such delega\u00adtions include so-called \u201ccorporate settlement mills,\u201d a practice in which corporations that have been accused of wrongdoing essentially adjudi\u00adcate victims\u2019 claims, sometimes in ways that preclude the victims from seeking relief in court.[footnote]Dana A. Remus &amp; Adam S. Zimmerman, The Corporate Settlement Mill, 101 Va. L. Rev. 129, 136\u201341 (2015) (arguing that corporate settlement mills \u201cprivatize dispute resolution nearly completely, and are subject to far weaker (if any) forms of public regulation and oversight\u201d).[\/footnote] This Article\u2019s framework confirms the many concerns that scholars have voiced about this practice and suggests the outlines of a general approach to enhancing its legitimacy.\r\n\r\nBut however important these and other procedural issues may be, the most pressing one remains arbitration. This Part accordingly revisits the delegation critique of arbitration in light of what the previous Parts have revealed about civil procedure\u2019s own delegations of state power. As section\u00a0IV.A argues, proponents of the delegation critique rightly worry that arbitration delegates significant coercive power to private parties and that, under current Supreme Court precedent, private parties can abuse that power with virtual impunity. In the end, though, the delegations of state power in arbitration are conceptually continuous with those in ordinary civil litigation; the former may lend themselves to more egre\u00adgious forms of abuse, but both sets of delegations fundamentally raise the same kinds of concerns. This continuity suggests an alternative approach to arbitration\u2019s delegation problem: adapting civil procedure\u2019s delega\u00adtion-policing doctrines for arbitration\u2019s delegations.\r\n\r\nSection IV.B begins to take up that task. This Article\u2019s approach focuses less on the <em>enforceability<\/em> of arbitration clauses and more on the <em>reviewability<\/em> of arbitral proceedings and awards. Whereas holding broad classes of arbitration clauses unenforceable effectively restricts private parties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to arbitration\u2019s delegations before any abuse has occurred, reviewing arbitral proceedings and awards allows courts to <em>police<\/em> those delegations for abuse after the fact\u2014the primary strategy civil procedure employs with respect to the delegations in ordinary civil litigation. There may indeed be compelling reasons to severely restrict access to arbitration\u2019s delegations ex ante. But short of that, the lesson of civil procedure\u2019s delegations is that many of the concerns about delegated state power in arbitration can be addressed by policing arbitration\u2019s delegations for abuse ex post.\r\n<h3>A. Delegating Procedure Redux<\/h3>\r\n1. <em>The Delegation Critique Defended<\/em>. \u2014 Proponents of the delegation critique tend to portray arbitration as a radical departure from ordinary civil litigation. Whereas public institutions and officials discharge the state\u2019s dispute-resolution functions in ordinary civil litigation, most scholars suppose, arbitration \u201cprivatizes\u201d or \u201coutsources\u201d many of those functions.[footnote]See supra notes 6\u20139, 31\u201333 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] We can now see that this contrast is overdrawn.[footnote]And not just because of practices such as contract procedure and court-annexed ADR. See supra notes 10, 26.[\/footnote] Ordinary civil litigation likewise delegates many of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution functions to private parties, thereby vesting them with significant coercive power.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that scholars have been wrong to worry about the delegations of state power involved in arbitration. On the contrary, those delegations raise the same basic concerns as the delegations in ordinary civil litigation. To be sure, what this Article calls the \u201cdelegation critique\u201d actually comprises a number of related, but distinct, criticisms, including the following: Binding dispute resolution is an inherently \u201cpublic function\u201d that should not be delegated to private parties except subject to strict limits,[footnote]See, e.g., Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 997\u201399; cf. Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 533 (raising similar concerns about contract procedure). Resnik\u2019s concerns about \u201cprivatization\u201d and \u201coutsourcing\u201d can also be understood in these terms. See supra note 6 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] private parties should not be able to use procedure to insulate themselves from liability for violating substantive rights,[footnote]See, e.g., Radin, Fine Print, supra note 8, at 33\u201334; Glover, supra note 8, at 3075\u201376; David S. Schwartz, Claim-Suppressing Arbitration: The New Rules, 87 Ind. L.J. 239, 240\u201342 (2012) [hereinafter Schwartz, Claim-Suppressing Arbitration]; Schwartz, Small Print, supra note 8, at 110.[\/footnote] and private parties should generally be prohibited from making law.[footnote]See, e.g., Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 480; David Horton, Mass Arbitration and Democratic Legitimacy, 85 U. Colo. L. Rev. 459, 501\u201302 (2014).[\/footnote] Scholars have further argued that adjudication not only resolves private disputes but also realizes a number of public goods that arbitration forgoes\u2014most notably, the production of legal precedent to guide the resolution of future cases[footnote]See, e.g., Richard M. Alderman, Consumer Arbitration: The Destruction of the Common Law, 2 J. Am. Arb. 1, 11\u201312 (2003); Myriam Gilles, The Day Doctrine Died: Private Arbitration and the End of Law, 2016 U. Ill. L. Rev. 371, 409\u201313; Charles L. Knapp, Taking Contracts Private: The Quiet Revolution in Contract Law, 71 Fordham L. Rev. 761, 785 (2002); Rex R. Perschbacher &amp; Debra Lyn Bassett, The End of Law, 84 B.U. L. Rev. 1, 30 (2004). This criticism echoes Owen Fiss\u2019s classic critique of settlement. See Owen M. Fiss, Against Settlement, 93 Yale L.J. 1073, 1085 (1984) (arguing that settlement stymies the development of the law).[\/footnote] and public transparency about violations of substantive law.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2894\u2013900; Sternlight, Mandatory Arbitration, supra note 27, at 1664\u201365; cf. Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 513\u201314 (raising similar concerns about contract procedure).[\/footnote] And whereas civil litigation proceeds (largely) in open court, arbitration is almost completely shielded from public scrutiny.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Access, supra note 6, at 133\u201342; Judith Resnik, Courts: In and out of Sight, Site, and Cite: The Norman Shachoy Lecture, 53 Vill. L. Rev. 771, 799\u2013809 (2008); Resnik, Uncovering, supra note 6, at 549\u201351; Judith Resnik, Whither and Whether Adjudication?, 86 B.U. L. Rev. 1101, 1137 (2006).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhile it is important to recognize the differences among these various criticisms of arbitration, each ultimately presumes the kind of delegation identified in Part I. Each problem, that is, arises only because arbitration allows private parties to tap the coercive power of the state without any meaningful judicial oversight. Thus, private parties perform the inherently \u201cpublic function\u201d of dispute resolution only insofar as their decisions are <em>binding<\/em>\u2014more or less automatically backed by the coercive power of the state.[footnote]See Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 997 (arguing that, in contrast to nonbinding dispute resolution, \u201c[t]he binding resolution of disputes is, of course, a traditionally exclusive public function\u201d).[\/footnote] Private parties can use procedure to evade substantive legal obligations only insofar as courts will more or less automatically enforce their procedural choices. Privately made rules constitute \u201claw\u201d only insofar as they\u2019re coercively enforced without any real judicial review.[footnote]See Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 441, 444 (arguing that the FAA, as construed by the Supreme Court, \u201callows private parties to engage in lawmaking\u201d by \u201cmak[ing] arbitration clauses enforceable with few restrictions\u201d and \u201callow[ing] drafters to cut judges out of the loop\u201d).[\/footnote] Arbitration forgoes the public goods of precedent and transparency only insofar as private parties can authoritatively resolve their disputes unsupervised. And private parties can shield dispute reso\u00adlution from public scrutiny only insofar as their authoritative decisions are insulated from judicial review, which <em>would<\/em> be subject to public scrutiny. None of these problems would be so acute if a party to an arbitration agreement could, notwithstanding the agreement, either litigate her dispute in court or at least obtain meaningful judicial review of any arbitral award;[footnote]Before the FAA, the \u201crevocability doctrine\u201d allowed a party to an arbitration agreement to revoke the agreement and litigate her dispute in court at any time before an arbitral award was rendered. See Ian R. Macneil, American Arbitration Law: Reformation, Nationalization, Internalization 20 (1992).[\/footnote] each problem stems from the fact that the state coercively enforces arbitration without adequate scrutiny. This is the sense in which arbitration can be understood to <em>delegate<\/em> state power.[footnote]Cf. Davis &amp; Hershkoff, supra note 10, at 535 (linking the concern that contract procedure \u201cprivatiz[es],\u201d \u201coutsource[es],\u201d or \u201cdelegate[es]\u201d the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers with the concern that it forgoes various \u201cpublic goods\u201d associated with litigation).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnd the current arbitration regime does indeed pervasively delegate state power in precisely that sense. As others have recognized, the FAA, which governs the relationship between courts and arbitration, contains multiple delegations on its face.[footnote]See, e.g., Brunet, Arbitration and Constitutional Rights, supra note 9, at 109; Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 480; Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1006; Sternlight, Rethinking, supra note 9, at 42.[\/footnote] On the front end, the Act requires federal district courts, upon motion, to compel arbitration and to stay any related judicial proceedings in any dispute subject to a valid arbitration clause.[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03\u20134 (2012).[\/footnote] As for the arbitral proceedings themselves, the FAA authorizes the parties to choose a method for appointing an arbitrator and, by exten\u00adsion, the procedures she will follow.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a05. If the arbitration clause fails to specify a method or if the parties fail to follow the specified method, then the court may appoint an arbitrator. Id.[\/footnote] Whomever they appoint, in turn, is empowered to subpoena nonparty witnesses and documentary evidence.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a07. Courts are divided over whether this provision permits arbitrators to compel prehearing \u201cdiscovery\u201d from nonparties or only the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses at an actual arbitral \u201chearing.\u201d See \u00adRandy J. Sutton, Annotation, Discovery in Federal Arbitration Proceedings, 45 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 51, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a013\u201316 (2010) (collecting cases).[\/footnote] Although a subpoena issues \u201cin the name of the arbitrator\u201d and under her signature, the parties can petition a federal district court for an order compelling compliance, on pain of sanctions.[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07.[\/footnote] On the back end, if the agreement so provides, a party may seek a court order confirming any arbitral award,[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a09.[\/footnote] with the order \u201chav[ing] the same force and effect, in all respects, as, and be[ing] subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in an action,\u201d such that \u201cit may be enforced as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered.\u201d[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a013.[\/footnote] The FAA thus repeatedly endows the decisions of private parties and their chosen arbitrators with the full and virtually automatic coercive backing of the state[footnote]See Richard C.

In fact, the Act, as construed by the Supreme Court, affirmatively frustrates almost all judicial delegation-policing efforts, severely limiting the ability of courts to review a privately chosen arbitrator\u2019s actions before coercively enforc\u00ading them.[footnote]See Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 489\u201393; Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2810.[\/footnote] Courts generally may not scrutinize an arbitrator\u2019s subpoena for relevance or materiality before compelling compliance with it.[footnote]See, e.g., In re Sec. Life Ins.

Given the statute\u2019s broad delegations and dearth of delegation-policing mechanisms, it seems fair to conclude along with proponents of the delegation critique that the FAA has \u201caggrandized private parties.\u201d[footnote]Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 456.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nScholars are right to worry about this state of affairs and to decry the Supreme Court\u2019s seeming nonchalance toward the FAA\u2019s broad delega\u00adtions of state power. In addition to all of the concerns raised by propo\u00adnents of the delegation critique, this Article has highlighted the risk that private parties will abuse delegations such as those in the FAA, violating important public values and potentially rendering the entire political community complicit in their wrongdoing. Perhaps we could tolerate that risk if, as in ordinary civil litigation, courts possessed meaningful mechanisms to repudiate abusive exercises of delegated power in arbitra\u00adtion. But the Supreme Court has largely eviscerated what few delegation-policing mechanisms the FAA arguably contains.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Beyond Enforceability<\/em>. \u2014 Proponents of the delegation critique have proposed to address this problem primarily by curbing arbitration\u2014essentially, limiting private parties\u2019 <em>access<\/em> to the FAA\u2019s delegations of state power. They would do so in two ways. On the one hand, many scholars would have courts refuse to enforce arbitration clauses in broad catego\u00adries of disputes, particularly disputes between sophisticated parties and individual consumers or employees, mandating that such disputes be resolved exclusively through court-based adjudication.[footnote]See supra note 27 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Linda S. Mullenix, Gaming the System: Protecting Consumers from Unconscionable Contractual Forum-Selection and Arbitration Clauses, 66 Hastings L.J. 719, 756\u201360 (2015); Resnik, Privatization, supra note 6, at 1812; Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1017\u201334; Richard C. Reuben, FAA Law, Without the Activism: What If the Bellwether Cases Were Decided by a Truly Conservative Court?, 60 U. Kan. L. Rev. 883, 922\u201324 (2012). Scholars have made similar proposals for other forms of procedural private ordering, such as forum-selection clauses. See, e.g., Paul B. Carrington &amp; Paul H. Haagen, Contract and Jurisdiction, 1996 Sup. Ct. Rev. 331, 332, 351\u201361, 401; Linda S. Mullenix, Another Choice of Forum, Another Choice of Law: Consensual Adjudicatory Procedure in Federal Court, 57 Fordham L. Rev. 291, 362\u201363 (1988).[\/footnote] Because the arbi\u00adtration clauses governing such disputes almost always appear in contracts of adhesion, scholars argue that courts should either refuse to enforce adhesive arbitration clauses outright or, to similar effect, rigorously assess the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of such clauses, defining \u201cvolun\u00adtariness\u201d in a way that precludes enforcement.[footnote]See supra notes 27, 332 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] On the other hand, some scholars would have courts enforce only those arbitration clauses that provide for arbitration proceedings that closely mirror ordinary civil litigation.[footnote]See supra note 28 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2811, 2921; Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 600; Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1046\u2013101; Teresa J. Verges, Evolution of the Arbitration Forum as a Response to Mandatory Arbitration, 18 Nev. L.J. (forthcoming 2018) (manuscript at 5, 18\u201319, 22) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); cf. Sarah Rudolph Cole &amp; E. Gary Spitko, Arbitration and the <em>Batson<\/em> Principle, 38 Ga. L. Rev. 1145, 1147\u201351 (2004) (considering the extension of civil <em>Batson<\/em> to arbitration); Paul R. Verkuil, Privatizing Due Process, 57 Admin. L. Rev. 963, 983\u201386 (2005) (arguing that arbitration should be shaped by due process values).[\/footnote] Arbitration, on this view, would be much less disconcerting if it resembled the proverbial \u201cday in court,\u201d with ample discovery, an impartial adjudicator, and ade\u00adquate remedies. To be sure, some of these same scholars simultaneously advocate enhanced judicial review of arbitral awards and proceedings\u2014but only as part of a belt-and-suspenders approach rather than as a distinct strategy.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2811 (advocating \u201coversight on both process and outcomes ex post\u201d alongside various ex ante restrictions on enforceability); Stone, Rustic Justice, supra note 7, at 1025\u201328 (advocating due process protections, heightened review, and reinstatement of the revocability doctrine).[\/footnote] And they ultimately put more weight on limiting the enforce\u00adment of arbitration clauses, as opposed to more closely scrutinizing the outputs of arbitration proceedings.[footnote]See, e.g., Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 493\u201396 (calling for greater judicial review of arbitration but emphasizing review of arbitration clauses as part of the enforceability and arbitrability analyses, rather than review of arbitral awards and proceedings as part of the vacatur and confirmation analyses). Scholars have recently begun to address these kinds of proposals to administrative agencies as well as courts. See, e.g., Daniel T. Deacon, Agencies and Arbitration, 117 Colum. L. Rev. 991, 993\u201394 (2017) (advocating greater administrative regulation of arbitration); David L. Noll, Regulating Arbitration, 105 Calif. L. Rev. 985, 1031\u201333 (2017) (same). But see Zachary D. Clopton, Class Actions and Executive Power, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 878, 884, 887 (2017) (identifying drawbacks of an administrative approach).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis emphasis on the enforceability of arbitration clauses is under\u00adstandable as a practical matter. For at least as currently construed by the Supreme Court, the FAA gives courts somewhat more leeway to keep disputes out of arbitration in the first place than to reassert control over them once they\u2019ve been shunted there\u2014either by deeming an arbitration clause unenforceable under State and federal law doctrines preserved by the Act\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02 (2012). The Court has, however, significantly cabined the savings clause, interpreting \u00a7\u00a02 to preempt a number of State law doctrines, and to displace a number of federal law doctrines, that would keep more categories of disputes in court. See, e.g., Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 133 S. Ct. 2304, 2310\u201311 (2013) (declining to apply the federal effective-vindication doctrine); AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 346 (2011) (finding that California\u2019s unconscionability doctrine \u201cinterferes with arbitration\u201d).[\/footnote] or as part of determining whether the parties actually agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute (the so-called arbitrability determination).[footnote]See Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 443\u201345 (2006) (discussing arbitrability). Unless, that is, the parties agreed to delegate that determination to the arbitrator. See Rent-A-Center, W., Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 78 (2010) (allowing parties to delegate the arbitrability determination to arbitrators). For a critical overview of such \u201cdelegation clauses,\u201d see generally David Horton, Arbitration About Arbitration, 70 Stan. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2018) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nScholars have also adduced deeply principled reasons for restricting access to arbitration\u2019s delegations in broad categories of cases. First, sophisticated parties, such as corporations, frequently insert arbitration clauses into contracts of adhesion with ordinary individuals, a practice that, many believe, allows them to exploit the FAA\u2019s delegations to effectively force individuals to relinquish their right to their \u201cday in court\u201d for a one-sided arbitration proceeding.[footnote]See, e.g., Radin, Fine Print, supra note 8, at 19\u201332; Horton, Delegation, supra note 7, at 486\u201389; Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2808, 2839\u201340, 2863\u201374; see also Linda J. Demaine &amp; Deborah R. Hensler, \u201cVolunteering\u201d to Arbitrate Through Predispute Arbitration Clauses: The Average Consumer\u2019s Experience, 67 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 55, 72\u201374 (2004); Knapp, supra note 308, at 788\u201389; David S. Schwartz, Mandatory Arbitration and Fairness, 84 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1247, 1249 (2009); Sternlight, Mandatory Arbitration, supra note 27, at 1648\u201353. Scholars have criticized other forms of procedural private ordering on similar grounds. See, e.g., Taylor &amp; Cliffe, supra note 10, at 1105.[\/footnote] Many have argued that the FAA was never intended to apply to such contracts but only to contracts between sophisticated commercial parties.[footnote]See, e.g., Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 124 (2001) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Imre Szalai, Outsourcing Justice: The Rise of Modern Arbitration Laws in America 188\u201389 (2013); Christopher R. Leslie, The Arbitration Bootstrap, 94 Tex. L. Rev. 265, 300\u201320 (2015). Many proponents of the delegation critique sympathize with this argument, see, e.g., Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2836\u201338, though their concerns about \u201cprivatization\u201d and \u201coutsourcing\u201d do not depend on it.[\/footnote] The exploitative nature of these agreements is exemplified for many scholars by arbitra\u00adtion clauses that forbid class arbitration even in so-called negative-value cases, in which the costs of prosecuting the case on an individual basis (either in arbitration or a lawsuit) exceed any potential recovery.[footnote]For a cogent indictment of class-arbitration bans, see <em>Italian Colors<\/em>, 133 S. Ct. at 2313\u201320 (Kagan, J., dissenting); see also, e.g., Myriam Gilles &amp; Gary Friedman, After Class: Aggregate Litigation in the Wake of <em>AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion<\/em>, 79 U. Chi. L. Rev. 623, 628\u201329 (2012).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, whereas most scholars tend to view arbitration\u2019s delegations as differing from civil procedure\u2019s in kind, this Article has essentially argued that the two differ in degree; arbitration and ordinary civil litigation may differ in the <em>extent <\/em>to which each delegates state power, but they do not differ in the <em>fact<\/em> that each delegates state power. Even accepting that characterization, however, one might think that the differ\u00adence in degree makes all the difference. Civil procedure delegates various procedural powers piecemeal while retaining as the final decisionmaker a public official who is constrained by both substantive law and procedural rules and who must give public reasons for her decisions; arbitration, by contrast, authorizes private parties to assign the state\u2019s dispute-resolution function wholesale to a private decisionmaker.\r\n\r\nBoth sets of concerns have a lot of merit, but they have been fully aired in the literature, as have the resulting proposals to dramatically curtail arbitration.[footnote]See supra notes 6\u20139, 339 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Notwithstanding the extensive scholarly criticism, the Supreme Court has steadfastly adhered to its decades-old jurispru\u00addence upholding the enforceability of adhesive arbitration clauses against individual consumers and employees.[footnote]Cf. Markovits, supra note 153, at 487 (\u201cArbitration\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is here to stay.\u201d).[\/footnote] What proponents of the delega\u00adtion critique have missed is that civil procedure contains the seeds of another kind of response to arbitration\u2019s delegation problem, one with its own, distinct logic. Even if courts continue to enforce arbitration clauses that many scholars consider problematic, we should empower courts to repudiate the abuses of delegated state power that occur during arbitration after the fact.\r\n\r\nA delegation-policing approach holds promise notwithstanding the significant differences between arbitration and ordinary civil litigation. The power asymmetries between the parties do indeed tend to be more pronounced in arbitration than in civil litigation, and arbitration involves the wholesale delegation of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers to privately chosen arbitrators, in contrast to the piecemeal delegations in civil litigation. In light of all this, many scholars worry that sophisticated parties can use arbitration to effectively suppress legal claims, making arbitral proceedings so one-sided that no victim of wrongdoing would bother to invoke them to seek redress.[footnote]See supra note 8 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Resnik, Access, supra note 6, at 143\u201354 (reporting empirical findings that individual consumers rarely use arbitration).[\/footnote] But adopting delegation-policing doctrines might still go at least some way toward addressing this concern. If courts reviewed arbitral awards and proceedings more rigorously before enforcing the awards\u2014if arbitration\u2019s delegations were better policed\u2014the prospect of such review might have a feedback effect of rendering those processes less one-sided in many cases. It might then become more worthwhile for would-be plaintiffs to actually go through with an arbitration when their claims were subject to a valid arbitration clause. Greater policing ex post, in short, might help to make arbitration fairer ex ante.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, such ex post delegation-policing strategies may be insuf\u00adficient to resolve some of the biggest controversies surrounding arbitra\u00adtion. It may be impossible, for example, to address the problems posed by class-arbitration bans without prohibiting them ex ante. Nonetheless, we can combat a significant amount of abuse by having courts police arbitration ex post, through analogues of civil procedure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines.\r\n<h3>B. Policing Arbitration\u2019s Delegations<\/h3>\r\nThis section begins to think about how we might recast civil proce\u00addure\u2019s delegation-policing doctrines to fit arbitration\u2019s delegations of state power. Given the magnitude of the task, the doctrinal proposals outlined here are necessarily impressionistic. This section aims only to give a gen\u00aderal sense of what a delegation-policing approach to arbitration might look like rather than to develop a comprehensive program for reform. In doing so, however, this section attempts to illustrate how we can look to civil procedure to allay some of the concerns about arbitration.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Rescinding Delegations<\/em>. \u2014 The FAA currently contains no cognates of the doctrines in civil procedure that rescind delegated state powers when they\u2019re being abused. It seems, however, that such doctrines could play a salutary role in arbitration too. One possibility would be to amend the FAA to provide for interlocutory judicial review of certain procedural decisions made during an arbitration and for the termination of the arbitration if a court determined that any of those decisions were abu\u00adsive.[footnote]It is important to distinguish this proposed review from interlocutory appellate review of district court decisions regarding arbitration. The FAA already provides for such appeals, though only from district court decisions refusing to enforce an arbitration clause. Compare 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a016(a)(1)(B) (2012) (permitting interlocutory appeals from district court refusals to compel arbitration), with id. \u00a7\u00a016(b)(2) (forbidding most interlocutory appeals from district court orders compelling arbitration).[\/footnote] The proposal might work as follows. Unless an arbitration clause was exploitative on its face, a court would compel arbitration upon the defendant\u2019s request and stay any related judicial proceedings initiated by the plaintiff. But the plaintiff would be allowed to return to court during the course of the arbitration to challenge some of the arbitrator\u2019s procedural decisions. If the court agreed with the plaintiff that the arbitrator had abused her delegated powers in making those decisions, it would discontinue the arbitration and lift the stay on the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit, thereby reasserting state control over delegated dispute-resolution powers.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would help to address some of the procedural deficiencies in arbitration identified by proponents of the delegation critique. As noted earlier, scholars have faulted arbitration for all too frequently denying plaintiffs the kinds of procedural protections they would enjoy in ordinary civil litigation, particularly a meaningful opportunity to obtain discovery and present evidence.[footnote]See supra notes 28, 334 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] When an arbitrator denies those opportunities, and when the plaintiff can\u2019t make her case without them, a court could deem the arbitrator\u2019s decision an abuse of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers and reassert state authority over the dispute. The bar for what constitutes \u201cabuse\u201d would, of course, have to be set quite high. It would not be sufficient for a plaintiff simply to disagree with an arbitrator\u2019s determination that, say, a particular document wasn\u2019t discoverable or the testimony of a particular witness was cumulative. But it seems reasonable to rescind delegated state powers from an arbitrator whose procedural decisions clearly thwart a fair resolution of the dispute.[footnote]The FAA does already authorize federal courts to vacate a final arbitral award when the arbitrator \u201crefus[ed] to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(3). But courts have interpreted this provision narrowly. See, e.g., La. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. ex rel. Coastal Prot. Restoration Auth. v. FEMA, No. 17-30140, 2018 WL 611215, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 29, 2018) (noting that vacatur under \u00a7\u00a010(a)(3) is permitted only in \u201cvery unusual circumstances\u201d). And in any case, a party shouldn\u2019t have to await a final award before being able to challenge egregious abuse by an arbitrator.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis proposal prompts an obvious objection: Permitting interlocu\u00adtory judicial review of arbitrators\u2019 procedural decisions would invite a flood of piecemeal appeals, which would undermine the benefits of arbitration and burden the courts. This problem could be substantially ameliorated, however, by making interlocutory review discretionary with the court rather than as of right,[footnote]Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) (authorizing discretionary interlocutory appeals from class-certification decisions).[\/footnote] and limiting such review to just a few key pro\u00adcedural decisions, such as the decisions whether to permit discovery and the presentation of evidence. And courts could further discourage abuse of the interlocutory-review mechanism by imposing sanctions for review petitions that did not even plausibly allege an abuse of delegated power.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Withholding Enforcement<\/em>. \u2014 The FAA already contains a few provi\u00adsions that, properly construed, could provide a basis for implementing a strategy of withholding coercive enforcement from abusive exercises of delegated power in arbitration. For one, the FAA authorizes federal district courts to compel compliance with an arbitrator\u2019s subpoena of a nonparty witness.[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07.[\/footnote] Although courts tend to rubber-stamp arbitral subpoenas,[footnote]See supra note 324 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] one could imagine a regime in which judges scrutinized the subpoenas more closely and refused to compel compliance with those that abuse the state\u2019s investigatory powers.\r\n\r\nFor another, the Supreme Court could overturn its precedents nar\u00adrowly interpreting the provisions of the FAA governing the confirma\u00adtion, vacatur, and modification of final arbitral awards and permit closer judicial review of such awards (though given its current composition, the Court is unlikely to change course anytime soon).[footnote]See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a09\u201311 (specifying the procedures for confirmation, vacatur, correction, and modification of an arbitral award); Resnik, Diffusing Disputes, supra note 6, at 2882 (lamenting that the Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly stipulated the adequacy of arbitrations and rejected judicial monitoring of the outcomes\u201d).[\/footnote] Courts would not, of course, review arbitral awards de novo but would instead apply something more akin to the deferential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard for judicial review of the decisions of administrative agencies.[footnote]The model would be the more deferential variant of arbitrary and capricious review. But cf. Richard A. Nagareda, Turning from Tort to Administration, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 899, 903 (1996) (advocating \u201chard look\u201d review of class action settlements in mass-tort cases). Instituting even such limited review, however, would at the very least require overruling the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(4). See supra notes 327\u2013330 and accompanying text. Some State and lower federal courts appear to hold out the possibility of arbitrary and capricious review for arbitral awards, but such \u201cclaims almost always fail.\u201d Reuben, Personal Autonomy, supra note 326, at 1115. Another alternative would be to expand some courts\u2019 practice of reviewing arbitral awards for a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d see id. at 1110\u201313, though understanding that standard to restrict arbitrators\u2019 discretion more than it currently does, see id. at 1111 (noting that \u201cfew\u201d courts actually set aside arbitral awards for manifest disregard).[\/footnote] While many scholars have advocated greater judicial scrutiny of arbitral awards, this Article\u2019s delegation framework grounds that proposal in a distinct logic rather than seeing it as just another way to curb arbitration.\r\n\r\nBolstering judicial review would go some way toward addressing a significant concern with arbitration: that most arbitrators are biased in favor of the repeat players that pay their fees and generate most of their business.[footnote]See, e.g., Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1064\u201367 (describing the \u201crepeat player phenomenon\u201d); Schwartz, Claim-Suppressing Arbitration, supra note 306, at 248 (\u201c[T]he system of arbitration as a structural matter creates financial incentives to decide questions of arbitrator jurisdiction (\u2018who decides\u2019) and even merits issues favorably toward those who pay them.\u201d); Jessica Silver-Greenberg &amp; Michael Corkery, In Arbitration, a \u2018Privatization of the Justice System,\u2019 N.Y. Times (Nov. 1, 2015), http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/02\/business\/dealbook\/in-arbitration-a-privatization-of-the-justice-system.html (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (citing records showing that \u201c41 arbitrators each handled 10 or more cases for one company between 2010 and 2014\u201d).[\/footnote] The Constitution requires an impartial arbitrator.[footnote]Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., 393 U.S. 145, 150 (1968).[\/footnote] But this requirement confronts a well-recognized dilemma: If a repeat-player defendant pays an arbitrator\u2019s fees, the arbitrator may be incentivized to rule for the defendant, in the hope that it will continue to send disputes her way; yet a defendant can\u2019t require an individual plaintiff to pay all of the arbitrator\u2019s (considerable) fees, lest it effectively foreclose all relief. Notwithstanding this dilemma, scholars have argued that courts should refuse to enforce arbitration clauses that create even the potential for subtle forms of bias.[footnote]See, e.g., Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1062\u201367 (calling for inquiries into \u201cpassive bias\u201d and \u201cstructural bias\u201d).[\/footnote] Under a delegation-policing approach, by contrast, a court would review an arbitral award for arbitrariness or capriciousness. While that standard would still afford arbitrators significant discretion, it would filter out those proceedings in which the arbitrator was actually biased and the bias infected the award by prompting the arbitrator to rule based on partiality for the defendant rather than any legal or contractual ground.[footnote]Cf. Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 349\u201350 (1980) (holding that, to prove a violation of the right to conflict-free counsel, a defendant must show \u201cthat his counsel actively represented conflicting interests\u201d).[\/footnote] The prospect of such review, moreover, could potentially deter many forms of bias. This proposal could be grounded in the provision of the FAA permitting vacatur based on \u201cevident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,\u201d[footnote]9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a010(a)(2).[\/footnote] but understanding \u201cpartiality\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d more capaciously than courts currently do.[footnote]See, e.g., Positive Software Sols., Inc. v. New Century Mortg. Corp., 476 F.3d 278, 283 (5th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (\u201c[I]n nondisclosure cases, an award may not be vacated because of a trivial or insubstantial prior relationship between the arbitrator and the parties to the proceeding.\u201d).[\/footnote] That broader conception seems justified once one recognizes that arbitrators are vested with significant state power and therefore have a responsibility to exer\u00adcise that power consistent with important public values.\r\n\r\nOne practical hurdle this proposal would have to surmount is that there is no right to a reasoned opinion in arbitration, and arbitrators rarely provide one (though sometimes a transcript of the arbitrator\u2019s decision is available).[footnote]See Reuben, Constitutional Gravity, supra note 9, at 1082\u201391 (canvassing arguments for and against reasoned opinions but recognizing that there is no constitu\u00adtional right to a reasoned opinion).[\/footnote] The lack of a reasoned opinion could frustrate judicial review in many cases, preventing a party from proving that the arbitrator or other party abused delegated state power. Short of requiring reasoned opinions in all arbitrations, courts could impose a \u201cpenalty default\u201d[footnote]Cf. Ian Ayres &amp; Robert Gertner, Filling Gaps in Incomplete Contracts: An Economic Theory of Default Rules, 99 Yale L.J. 87, 91 (1989) (defining a \u201cpenalty default\u201d as a default rule that is \u201cpurposefully set at what the parties would not want\u2014in order to encourage the parties to reveal information to each other or to third parties (especially the courts)\u201d).[\/footnote] in the absence of such an opinion, shifting the burden to the party seeking confirmation or opposing vacatur to prove that the alleged abuse of delegated power did <em>not<\/em> in fact occur. This would likely have the effect of incentivizing parties to require their chosen arbitrators to prepare reasoned opinions, just as expanded judicial review in general would likely incentivize arbitrators to exercise their powers more dispassionately.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Punishing Abuse<\/em>. \u2014 Finally, courts could punish abuse of delegated state power during arbitration by imposing sanctions during actions to confirm arbitral awards. The standard for imposing sanctions would resemble Rule 11\u2019s \u201cimproper purpose\u201d standard.[footnote]See supra notes 209\u2013211 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] According to such a standard, sanctions would be warranted when one party sought to confirm an arbitral award that issued from severely defective proceedings or sought confirmation after having forced the other party into arbitration for some illegitimate reason, such as to deprive her of an effective remedy for her injuries.[footnote]Cf. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 595 (1991) (considering, in assessing a forum-selection clause for \u201cfundamental fairness,\u201d whether the defendant included the clause with the \u201cbad-faith motive\u201d of \u201cdiscouraging [plaintiffs] from pursuing legitimate claims\u201d).[\/footnote] Courts could impose sanctions under either Rule 11 itself or their inherent powers.[footnote]See supra note 214 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] States could also create a cause of action for \u201cabuse of arbitral process,\u201d lying against the party who compelled the arbitration or the arbitrator herself, depending on who was ultimately respon\u00adsible for the abuse.[footnote]Creating a cause of action against arbitrators would require overturning decisions cloaking them in absolute judicial immunity. See, e.g., Austern v. Chi. Bd. Options Exch., Inc., 898 F.2d 882, 886 (2d Cir. 1990). See generally Maureen A. Weston, Reexamining Arbitral Immunity in an Age of Mandatory and Professional Arbitration, 88 Minn. L. Rev. 449 (2004) (arguing that arbitrators should enjoy only qualified, not absolute, immunity).[\/footnote] By punishing abuse of arbitra\u00adtion\u2019s delega\u00adtions, the state would not only repudiate the abuse but also incentivize private parties and arbitrators to design and conduct arbitra\u00adtions in accordance with important public values.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *<\/p>\r\nThe foregoing proposals are not without their problems.[footnote]So long as they were limited to purely domestic arbitrations, none of the proposals would put the United States in violation of its obligations under the New York Convention, which governs the enforcement of <em>foreign<\/em> arbitral awards. See Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention), June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2157, 330 U.N.T.S. 38; see also 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0201\u2013208 (2012) (prescribing procedures for the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in federal court). This Article does not address the distinct issues presented by international arbitration.[\/footnote] Those who are skeptical of arbitration will likely worry that the various dele\u00adgation-policing strategies, with their reliance on ex post judicial review, would prove too burdensome for the parties they\u2019re primarily designed to help\u2014namely, individuals seeking redress against sophisticated parties. Yet while plaintiffs and plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers may currently have inadequate incentives to challenge arbitral awards and procedures, the calculus would be different if the delegation-policing strategies outlined above were adopted. Indeed, with stronger delegation-policing doctrines, it might even be <em>easier<\/em> to challenge arbitral awards and procedures after the fact than to oppose sending a dispute to arbitration in the first place. That\u2019s because the primary legal bases for resisting the enforcement of an arbitration clause\u2014the State contract law doctrines of public policy and unconscionability and the federal effective-vindication doctrine[footnote]See supra note 337.[\/footnote]\u2014all turn on speculative inquiries about the likely conduct of the arbitra\u00adtion proceedings in a given case or set of cases, whereas the delegation-policing doctrines respond to abuse that has already occurred.\r\n\r\nSupporters of arbitration, on the other hand, will likely worry that the delegation-policing strategies would threaten to vitiate many of arbitra\u00adtion\u2019s purported benefits, such as finality, informality, and speed.[footnote]See, e.g., Lisa Bernstein, Understanding the Limits of Court-Connected ADR: A Critique of Federal Court-Annexed Arbitration Programs, 141 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2169, 2240\u201341, 2243 (1993); see also Hall St. Assocs. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 588 (2008) (explaining that limiting judicial review \u201cmaintain[s] arbitration\u2019s essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway,\u201d whereas permitting \u201cfull-bore legal and evidentiary appeals\u201d would render arbitration \u201cmerely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc., 341 F.3d 987, 998 (9th Cir. 2003))).[\/footnote] Some scholars have suggested that these benefits are exaggerated, as arbi\u00adtration has increasingly come to resemble litigation.[footnote]See, e.g., Edward Brunet, Replacing Folklore Arbitration with a Contract Model of Arbitration, 74 Tul. L. Rev. 39, 52\u201361 (1999) (arguing that the rules of the major arbitration organizations have become highly judicialized); Thomas J. Stipanowich, Arbitration: The \u201cNew Litigation,\u201d 2010 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1, 11\u201320 (2010) (arguing that arbitration increasingly employs litigation-like procedures, including discovery and hearings).[\/footnote] But whatever the merits of that debate, the delegation-policing approach advocated here would likely undermine arbitration primarily in one-off disputes between unequal parties\u2014precisely the kinds of disputes in which arbitration is most likely to involve abuse. For the weaker party in such disputes would have little reason not to invoke the delegation-policing doctrines. In disputes between sophisticated parties, by contrast, the parties would be more likely to have an ongoing relationship and thus would be more loath to invoke the delegation-policing doctrines, lest they undermine the efficiency advantages of arbitration for their future disputes.[footnote]Cf. Lisa Bernstein, Merchant Law in a Merchant Court: Rethinking the Code\u2019s Search for Immanent Business Norms, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1765, 1796 (1996) (identifying \u201cnorms that transactors follow in attempting to cooperatively resolve disputes in a manner that will not jeopardize future dealings\u201d); Stone, Rustic Justice, supra note 7, at 1024\u201330 (arguing that arbitration is most appropriate for disputes between the members of \u201cself-regulating normative communities\u201d).[\/footnote] It is also worth reemphasizing that, in any kind of dispute, the standard for showing an abuse of delegated power would be a strict one, such that the majority of arbitral decisions would in practice be final. In the end, though, we inevitably face a tradeoff between benefits to private parties and costs to public values whenever we delegate state power. A delegation-policing approach better accounts for both the benefits and the costs of arbitration\u2019s delegations than does the current regime.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nFor solutions to some of the most vexing problems with arbitration, we should look to civil procedure. Scholars have rightly worried that arbitration delegates state power to private parties. What they\u2019ve missed, however, is that a similar delegation problem has already been rehearsed in ordinary civil litigation. One of the most distinctive features of the American civil justice system is that it allows private parties to exercise significant coercive power without prior judicial approval; it is a relatively small step to conceptualize those private exercises of power as delega\u00adtions of state power. Responding to the potential for its delegations to be abused, civil procedure contains numerous doctrines that, rather than restrict access to delegated power before any abuse has occurred, allow the state to distance itself after the fact from exercises of delegated power that offend especially important public values. Civil procedure has even articulated a normative rationale for these delegation-policing doctrines: the need for the state (and the political community it serves) to avoid complicity in private wrongdoing. So the fundamental problem with arbi\u00adtration isn\u2019t that it delegates state power per se, but that it lacks the kinds of delegation-policing doctrines found throughout civil procedure. Once we grasp this major flaw in the current arbitration regime, we can move beyond the dichotomy between permitting private parties to abuse arbitration\u2019s delegations with virtual impunity, as current doctrine does, and putting strict ex ante limits on those delegations, as most critics of arbitration advocate. Even if arbitration clauses continue to be enforced more often than arbitration\u2019s critics think legitimate, we can still address many of the concerns about arbitration by expanding judicial review of arbitral awards and proceedings to enable courts to police arbitration\u2019s delegations, just as they already police civil procedure\u2019s.\r\n\r\nWhy have scholars overlooked this deep continuity between arbitra\u00adtion and ordinary civil litigation? This Article concludes by venturing a possible diagnosis and a prescription.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is the near monopoly procedural due process enjoys on normative questions in civil procedure. An analytical framework that is self-consciously preoccupied with the procedures of <em>state institutions<\/em> is bound to neglect crucial issues when we\u2019re assessing the exercise of coer\u00adcive power by <em>private parties<\/em>. Notwithstanding this blind spot, scholars continue to analyze procedural questions primarily in due process terms.[footnote]See, e.g., Resnik, Contract, supra note 6, at 663\u201364 (\u201cContract Procedure requires some oversight, through the lens of Due Process Procedure, because court-based decisionmaking entails opportunities to be heard.\u201d); see also supra notes 28, 334 and accompanying text (advocating the extension of due process norms to arbitration).[\/footnote] That approach will prove at best incomplete, eliding important issues raised by the privatization of the state\u2019s dispute-resolution powers. For the same reasons, procedural due process also glosses over core fea\u00adtures of ordinary civil litigation, which casts the state in a supporting role as often as a leading one.\r\n\r\nThe prescription, as this Article has sought to demonstrate, is a greater focus in civil procedure scholarship on liberal political theory and its account of political power. Scholars commonly turn to liberal political theory to understand other areas of the law, particularly consti\u00adtutional law[footnote]See, e.g., Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Legitimacy and the Constitution, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1787, 1796\u20131801 (2005) (discussing \u201cmoral and political legitimacy\u201d as an aspect of \u201cconstitutional legitimacy\u201d); Richard H. Pildes, Why Rights Are Not Trumps: Social Meanings, Expressive Harms, and Constitutionalism, 27 J. Legal Stud. 725, 726 (1998) (exploring the connections between constitutional law and theories of rights).[\/footnote] and criminal law.[footnote]See, e.g., George P. Fletcher, The Nature and Function of Criminal Theory, 88 Calif. L. Rev. 687, 700 (2000) (\u201cThis is fairly good proof that criminal theory seems to function today as a potpourri of political theory.\u201d); V.F. Nourse, Reconceptualizing Criminal Law Defenses, 151 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1691, 1703\u201326 (2003) (analyzing criminal law defenses in terms of political theory).[\/footnote] And it has even made some significant inroads into civil procedure, as scholars have invoked liberal-democratic values to justify various aspects of civil litigation.[footnote]For a recent example, see generally Alexandra Lahav, In Praise of Litigation (2017). Under the early influence of Lea Brilmayer, personal-jurisdiction scholarship has also incorporated many insights from political theory. See, e.g., Lea Brilmayer, Liberalism, Community, and State Borders, 41 Duke L.J. 1, 1 (1991) (analyzing personal jurisdiction in terms of political theory); George A. Rutherglen, Personal Jurisdiction and Political Authority (Va. Pub. Law &amp; Legal Theory Research Paper No. 2017-13, 2017) (same), http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2951109 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). And Martin Redish has criticized the contemporary class action from a similar perspective. See generally Martin H. Redish, Wholesale Justice: Constitutional Democracy and the Problem of the Class Action Lawsuit (2009).[\/footnote] But liberal political theory\u2019s account of political power has been virtually absent from debates about the privatization of civil justice. That is unfortunate. Civil proce\u00addure is one of the primary ways political power gets exercised in our society. As such, it raises all the same questions that attend the exercise of political power in any other institutional setting\u2014the boundary between public and private foremost among them. At the same time, civil proce\u00addure inflects these age-old questions with its unique division of labor between private parties and state officials. Liberal political theory can thus help us to more fruitfully conceptualize some of the problems with recent procedural trends, as well as to more readily apprehend the solutions our civil justice system already has to offer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Others, in lost chances for parenthood. Shortly before this Piece went to press, for example, two major clinics\u2014one in San Francisco, the other outside Cleveland\u2014announced that storage tank malfunctions destroyed thousands of cryopreserved eggs and embryos.[footnote]See Kate Snow, Rich Gardella &amp; Erika Edwards, University Hospitals Fertility Clinic Says Human Error Caused Embryo, Egg Failure, Today (Mar. 28, 2018), http:\/\/www.today.com\/\r\nhealth\/university-hospitals-fertility-clinic-failure-caused-human-error-t125910 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\n86RY-MRNC].[\/footnote] These incidents left hundreds of affected families asking how something like this could have happened and what if anything can be done.\r\n\r\nMy essay documented scores of unredressed errors, from pharmacists who fill\u00a0birth control prescriptions with prenatal vitamins to surrogacy agencies that implant one couple\u2019s embryos into someone else, from sperm banks whose donor profiles hide mental illness and criminal history to ultrasound technicians who tell expecting parents that their healthy fetus would be stillborn.[footnote]See, e.g., id. at 153.[\/footnote] We cannot know how frequently mistakes like these take place in the United States because there is no tracking system. But available data points are jarring. A 2008 survey of nearly half of all U.S. fertility clinics found that more than one in five had misdiagnosed, mislabeled, or mishandled reproductive materials.[footnote]See Susannah Baruch, David Kaufman &amp; Kathy L. Hudson, Genetic Testing of Embryos: Practices and Perspectives of U.S. In Vitro Fertilization Clinics, 89 Fertility &amp; Sterility 1053, 1055 (2008).[\/footnote] And it stands to reason that mishaps are probably at least as common in the U.S. as the 500+ reported each year in a rigorously regulated country like the United Kingdom.[footnote]Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, State of the Fertility Sector: 2016\u201317, at 24\u201326 (2017), http:\/\/www.hfea.gov.uk\/media\/2437\/hfea_state_of_the_sector_report_tagged.\r\npdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/PW96-QRQ2].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI analyzed hundreds of U.S. statutes and cases to show how family planners are left to proceed at their own risk and steel themselves against the repercussions of reproductive negligence.

There is no systematic reporting, even of transgressions like embryo mix-ups and freezer failures that resemble so-called never events. These are the most serious and preventable kind of patient harms\u2014surgery on the wrong body part or patient, for example\u2014that most states track by legislative mandate elsewhere in health care delivery.[footnote]See Dov Fox, Transparency Challenges in Reproductive Health Care, <em>in<\/em> Transparency in Health and Health Care: Legal and Ethical Possibilities and Limits (I.

My inquiry began with this puzzle: Why does the American legal system turn a blind eye to the wrongful frustration of efforts to pursue or avoid procreation\u2014however egregious the misconduct or devastating the injury?\r\n\r\nPublic law is part of the story. Congressional refusal to fund research involving human embryos freed the fertility industry since its emergence in the early 1980s to develop less as a medical practice than as a trade business. It is not just its free-market origins that insulate procreation-related services from meaningful state or federal oversight. Sterilization, surrogacy, and embryo selection\u2014these all are mired in complex controver\u00adsies about sex, pregnancy, and family life that cut across partisan divides.[footnote]See June Carbone &amp; Naomi Cahn, Embryo Fundamentalism, 18 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 1015, 1032 (2010).[\/footnote] There ideological tensions obscure the electoral risks of regulation, even in jurisdictions that are reliably red or blue. For example, progressive feminists disalign with disability-rights advocates on abortion protections related to fetal misdiagnosis of genetic abnormality.[footnote]See Marsha Saxton, Disability Rights and Selective Abortion, <em>in<\/em> The Disability Studies Reader 105, 112 (Lennard J. Davis ed., 2006). [\/footnote] Botched IVF, meanwhile, fragments much of the conservative coalition that celebrates the blessing of having children.[footnote]See Henry T. Greely, The End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction 167\u201368 (2016).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI focused less on the political economy of reproductive medicine, however, than on why our legal regime goes so easy on transgressions that disrupt this far-reaching domain of human life. I canvassed the constellation of reasons why reproductive negligence falls through the cracks of contract, property, and torts.[footnote]See id. at 164\u201375.[\/footnote] It goes beyond familiar suspicion of claims about intangible harm or fraudulent suits by parents who, having failed \u201cto exercise restraint or take responsibility,\u201d for example, might simply \u201cinvent an intent to prevent pregnancy.\u201d[footnote]Nell v. Froedtert &amp; Cmty. Health, 829 N.W.2d 175, 181 (Wis. Ct. App. 2013).[\/footnote] Private law re\u00adfuses to recognize reproductive injuries as real or serious. Indeed, it lacks even a practical way to think or talk about them.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 156.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI introduced a comprehensive framework of reproductive wrongs.[footnote]See id. at 176\u201380.[\/footnote] Some <em>impose<\/em> unwanted procreation.[footnote]See id. at 184\u201390; see also id. at 191\u201393 (explaining that the duty-mitigation doctrine holds that it is unreasonable to insist that women try having an abortion or giving a child up for adoption to make them eligible for recovery otherwise owed).[\/footnote] Others <em>deprive<\/em> parenthood from those who long for it.[footnote]See id. at 193\u2013200.[\/footnote] Others still <em>confound<\/em> plans not just for any child, but for one born with or without particular genetic traits.[footnote]See id. at 200\u201309.[\/footnote] I proposed corresponding causes of action that peg damages for successful claims to two factors.[footnote]See id. at 209\u201324.[\/footnote] First is how badly the injury harms the parents or prospective parents. Severity depends on the reasons they sought treatment and the repercussions of its defeat.[footnote]See id. at 224\u201326.[\/footnote] The second asks the extent to which trans\u00adgressions were to blame. The greater chances that the reproductive loss can be chalked up to user error, preexisting infertility, or genetic uncertainty, the lower the awards.[footnote]See id. at 226\u201330.[\/footnote] I also spelled out circumstances under which judges should void compensation on policy grounds as a violation of public interest or morality.[footnote]See id. at 231\u201340.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe commentaries by Professors Sanger, Rabin, and Keating refine and elevate these themes that I had sought to develop. I focus here on three of the hardest questions they tackle. First, Professor Sanger asks, what is the central harm when doctors or scientists upend people\u2019s plans about having children? Does negligence rob them of whatever measure of autonomous choice or control competent care would have let them exercise over whether, when, how, or with whom to reproduce? Or is the real injury the more workaday ways in which those thwarted decisions encroach on a life that is either free of childrearing\u2019s unwanted burdens or enriched by its sought-after blessings?\r\n\r\nProfessor Rabin moves the ball from the injuries sustained to the remedies owed. He situates legal relief within the common-law evolution of personality torts that range from false imprisonment to intrusion on privacy. In light of this history, he interrogates whether courthouse claims for reproductive negligence should take form in one overarching cause of action\u2014a single, unified right\u2014or the multiple more specific sticks that its unbundling reveals. And, tackling the most provocative among these, he urges me to clarify how such right(s) should recognize and compensate confounded efforts to have offspring who share genetic ties or racial resemblance. Finally, Professor Keating explores whether defeated attempts at parenthood, or freedom from it, are the kinds of loss that our tort system is built to protect against. Is tort compensation limited, he asks, to the impairment of existing things of value to us that we had already come to enjoy? Or can torts redress the loss of future goods that it was reasonable for us to expect? The pages that follow address these issues and related ones that Professors Sanger, Rabin, and Keating raise along the way.\r\n<h2>I. Identifying the Injury<\/h2>\r\nProfessor Sanger presses me to clarify \u201cthe nature of the harm\u201d at stake when procreation is wrongfully imposed, deprived, or confounded.[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 36.[\/footnote] She resists my \u201cattempt to connect the proposal for this new tort to the idea of autonomy\u201d that \u201cis already vindicated in the abortion jurispru\u00addence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 37.[\/footnote] The rhetoric of choice carries political baggage, she points out. Autonomy talk is rife with pejorative \u201cconnotations of consumer\u00adism and self-satisfaction\u201d that make it an \u201cunsympathetic strategy.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [\/footnote] More critically, Sanger argues, the real harm that reproductive negligence causes has less to do with choices than consequences. This injury \u201cis not the loss of control over [family] planning,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut rather the loss of what the plan meant to produce.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 36.[\/footnote] It is true that at times I referred to that harm in terms of choice or control.[footnote]See id. at 36\u201338.[\/footnote] But I never said that the individual\u2019s ability to make central life decisions for herself is the only or best reason to guard against botched fertility or infertility treatment. The \u201cinterests in making\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. decisions about pregnancy, parenthood, and offspring particu\u00adlars vindicate not just decisional autonomy (how freely she chooses),\u201d I underscored, \u201cbut also individual well-being (how well such outcomes help her live).\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 177 (\u201cWhatever satisfaction a person gets from knowing that the reproductive experiences she prizes are of her own making, it matters at least as much the ways in which those experiences help her to live well\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] Reproductive negligence characteristicall\u00ady inflicts concrete harms to core life projects and relationships.\r\n\r\nThis is how my introduction had framed what Sanger calls the \u201cspectral tangibleness\u201d of that loss:[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 38.[\/footnote]\r\n<blockquote>Determinations about having children tend\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to shape who people are, what they do, and how they want to be remembered. Many people find profound meaning and fulfillment either in pregnancy and parenthood or else in the aims or attachments that freedom from those roles facilitates. That is why the wrongful frustration of reproductive plans disrupts personal and profes\u00adsional lives in predictable and dramatic ways.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 155 (footnotes omitted); see also id. at 220 (arguing that \u201c[f]ew practices\u201d so gravely implicate \u201chealth, peace of mind, and livelihoods\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nI did not mean to cast autonomy in a leading role. And I agree that it cedes center stage to the real-world impacts when people who enlisted profes\u00adsionals to have \u201cno baby, a baby, and a special baby,\u201d in Sanger\u2019s terms, \u201cinstead received a baby, no baby, and the wrong kind of baby.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 32.[\/footnote] This \u201cfocus on well-being,\u201d my essay concluded, \u201cexplains the privileged status that procreation holds in our constitutional tradition better than predominant accounts based on autonomy or equality alone.\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 241.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnd yet autonomy deserves more than a cameo appearance. That value commands authority from its distinctive place in the jurisprudence of contraception and abortion.[footnote]See id. at 37.[\/footnote] The Supreme Court has laid emphasis on choice and control in affording fundamental-rights status to determina\u00adtions as \u201cprivate and sensitive\u201d[footnote]Carey v. Population Servs. Int\u2019l, 431 U.S. 678, 685 (1977).[\/footnote] as whether to initiate a pregnancy, and as \u201cintimate and personal\u201d[footnote]Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992) (plurality opinion) (O\u2019Connor, Kennedy &amp; Souter, JJ.).[\/footnote] as whether to keep it. There are limits to what we can learn from this constitutional emphasis on self-determination in matters of bodily integrity. It does not tell us, for example, whether procreation without sex (IVF) merits less protection than sex without procreation (the Pill),[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 219\u201320.[\/footnote] or whether courts should redress foiled efforts to select donors or embryos based on sex, race, or disability.[footnote]See id. at 221\u201322. For discussion of why I would permit recovery for confounded heredity but not race, see infra notes 93\u2013116 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] But it does make autonomy a natural perch from which to build out the case for broader reproductive protections.\r\n\r\nThe tension that Professor Sanger spotlights between choices and consequences plays out in a pioneering decision abroad. A few months ago, a Singapore couple won their suit against the clinic that swapped the husband\u2019s sperm with a stranger\u2019s.[footnote]ACB v. Thomson Med. Pte Ltd. [2017] SGCA 20 (Sing.).[\/footnote] The case reached the highest level of the Supreme Court of Singapore. It held the clinic liable for having upended the couple\u2019s plans to have a child with whom they would be \u201cbound by ties of blood and share physical traits.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 128.[\/footnote] The court called the case \u201cone of the most difficult\u201d in its history.[footnote]Id. at para. 210.[\/footnote] The unanimous opinion relied on <em>Reproductive Negligence<\/em> to establish a first-of-its-kind right to recover for the wrongful denial of \u201cgenetic continuity and biological lineage.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 128 (citing Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 179).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe court framed that injury in terms of both \u201cthe frustration of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. decisional autonomy\u201d as well as \u201cthe substantive impact that it has had on\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. well-being.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 130 (citing Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 174).[\/footnote] The mix-up \u201cdislocate[d]\u201d the couple\u2019s \u201creproductive plans\u201d for \u201cbiological parenthood.\u201d[footnote]Id. at paras. 125\u2013126.[\/footnote] It also had profound effects on them.[footnote]Id. at para. 147 (noting the \u201cunique\u201d harms that \u201cvary depending on the particular reasons fertility treatment was sought, the precise manner in which the negligence took place, and the personal circumstances of the plaintiff (such as the presence of other children or the familial and\/or cultural histories particular to him or her)\u201d (citing Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 219\u201320)).[\/footnote] The court noted the \u201canguish, stigma, disconcertment, and embarrassment\u201d they were reminded of every time a friend or stranger asked about the \u201cwife\u2019s fidelity and the paternity of [their] child[].\u201d[footnote]Id. at paras. 133, 150.[\/footnote] Wellbeing is what mattered more. But autonomy also helped to justify the need for redress. And its setback in such cases helps to round out a more complete account of the harm that reproductive negligence inflicts.\r\n\r\nThis loss of autonomy also explains my misgivings about Sanger\u2019s proposal to recognize a separate tort for negligence in childbirth. She calls salutary attention to the gendered character of reproductive interests.[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 39\u201342. Prenatal and postpartum experiences and expectations place singular demands on women\u2019s bodies, time, identities, and resources, for example, in ways that encroach on their \u201chealth and sexual freedom, their ability to enter and end relationships, their education and job training, their ability to provide for their families, and their ability to negotiate work-family conflicts in institutions organized [along] traditional sex-role assumptions.\u201d Reva B. Siegel, Sex Equality Arguments for Reproductive Rights: Their Critical Basis and Evolving Constitutional Expression, 56 Emory L.J. 815, 819 (2007).[\/footnote] Besides the three interests that I had distinguished in pregnancy (gestating a fetus), parenthood (raising a child), and particulars (selecting offspring traits), Sanger identifies a separate interest specific to childbirth in matters of labor and delivery. These cases involve medical mistakes that lead a woman to get the epidural injection for pain relief that she had expressly declined, for instance, or to deliver via Cesarean section instead of the vaginal birth that she strongly preferred.[footnote]See, e.g., Pemberton v. Tallahassee Med. Ctr., 66 F. Supp. 2d 1247, 1250 (N.D. Fla. 1999); Schreiber v. Physicians Ins. Co., 579 N.W.2d 730, 735\u201336 (Wis. Ct. App. 1998).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI would still exclude this interest from the new forms of protection that I proposed for the other three. These child-delivery errors have \u201cbeen neglected in torts\u201d for their own reasons,[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 44. Birthing mishaps have been overlooked, Sanger points out, because \u201chistorically, birthing women often expected to die during labor and rarely sued for physical harms that resulted from obstetric malpractice,\u201d while \u201c[m]ore recently, the fetus has become the primary patient in labor, similarly obscuring women\u2019s harms and their convictions about claiming them.\u201d Id. at 44\u201345 (citing Jamie R. Abrams, Distorted and Diminished Tort Claims for Women, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 1955, 1978\u201379 (2013)).[\/footnote] separate from policy concerns about the sanctity of life or the unease our legal system harbors toward the value of intangible reproductive loss.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 154, 159.[\/footnote] Faulty C-sections or epidurals implicate the physical harm or unconsented touching that qualify them for malpractice claims and pain-and-suffering damages.[footnote]The incursion on bodily integrity also provides the legal hook to recover for associated emotional distress. See Abrams, supra note 48, at 1968.[\/footnote] These material setbacks are precisely what is missing when providers switch donors, drop embryos, or misdiagnose fetuses.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 176\u201384.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nProfessor Rabin convinces me that the unitary action I proposed to remedy these injuries would be improved by dividing it into three.[footnote]See Rabin, supra note 1, at 233\u201335.[\/footnote] I had acknowledged the risk that reliance on any overarching right \u201ccould dissolve into disarray if its protections are too nebulous to implement\u201d across interests in pregnancy, parenthood, and particulars that \u201cresist consolidation into any one identical injury or claim.\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 211.[\/footnote] In the end, however, I was drawn to the flexibility of an overarching tort that could more smoothly adapt to inevitable changes in reproductive culture or technology.[footnote]See id. at 151, 159, 241.[\/footnote] Even in the months \u201csince Fox\u2019s essay was published,\u201d Professor Sanger notes, \u201cscientists for the first time successfully edited out a mutant gene from a human embryo.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 31.[\/footnote] Meanwhile, \u201cinnovations in genetics and stem cell research [may soon] make embryo selection\u201d for many more traits a common feature of reproductive life, thereby \u201cexpanding the possibilities for negligence.\u201d[footnote]Id. (citing Greely, supra note 11, at 1\u20132).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDespite the appeal of this single-tort approach, courthouse claims demand greater precision, Professor Rabin shows.[footnote]Rabin cogently analogizes my three reproductive-negligence torts to the four rights of privacy. See Rabin, supra note 1, at 233\u201335.[\/footnote] The wrongful disruption of plans to reproduce or not with particular traits in mind implicate discrete defenses and damages that judges and juries would risk running together under a monolithic right.[footnote]See id. at 233.[\/footnote] The fertility clinic that loses a cancer survivor\u2019s sperm or contaminates a couple\u2019s embryos leaves them with an empty cradle.[footnote]See id. at 234\u201335.[\/footnote] By contrast, the doctor who misprescribes birth control or overstates the risk of ending a pregnancy leaves women to carry or raise a child they were unable to.[footnote]See id. at 234.[\/footnote] And neither of these claims is quite like the swapping of reproductive donors or materials.[footnote]See id. at 235.[\/footnote] Rabin would disentangle the torts into the three separate wrongs that I had identified as procreation deprived, imposed, and confounded. I embrace his amendment wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis important revision brings us back to the Singapore mix-up. Sanger does well to worry in cases like this whether \u201csome parents might find themselves receiving less in compensation for\u201d the \u201cnonwhite child\u201d they got in place of a lighter-skinned one.[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 35.[\/footnote] That the donor here was Indian\u2014his complexion darker than the couple of German and Chinese descent\u2014forced the court to consider \u201cthe complex role that physical resemblance, race, and cultural and ethnic identity have had and continue to have on our individual well-being.\u201d[footnote]ACB v. Thomson Med. Pte Ltd. [2017] SGCA 20 (Sing.) at paras. 6, 8, 134.[\/footnote] The wife\u2019s affidavit singled out the baby\u2019s \u201cdifferent skin tone\u201d as the striking feature that \u201cnever fails to draw curious looks from the public\u201d and \u201cturn joyous family time into depressing moments.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 130.[\/footnote] Being born conspicuously browner than her parents, the justices noted, would leave the child and her family susceptible to the \u201cracist bullying\u201d of \u201cabusive and derogative comments and hurtful name calling.\u201d[footnote]Id. at paras. 132\u2013133 (discussing A &amp; B v.

Refining the Remedy<\/h2>\r\nBut what, exactly, is that money <em>for<\/em>? I gave three reasons to remedy reproductive negligence: to compensate victims, deter professional miscon\u00adduct, and affirm values. I laid emphasis on the first two.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 211\u201313.[\/footnote] Professors Sanger and Rabin persuade me that the third deserves more. If the main point was compensation, why limit damages to those like this couple injured by professional wrongdoing? I would not provide recovery, Sanger observes, to those who suffer the same disruption of genetic ties due to infertility, infidelity, or misrepre\u00adsentation.[footnote]See Sanger, supra note 1, at 29.[\/footnote] A companion\u2019s deceit, however shameful, doesn\u2019t breach formal duty of reproductive care between sexual partners who are generally presumed equally capable of affirming their own respective interests.[footnote]When a man resists paying child support for a child he unwittingly conceived, courts have accordingly chided him that his partner\u2019s having lied about using birth control \u201cin no way limited his [own] right to [have] use[d] contraception.\u201d L. Pamela P. v. Frank S., 449 N.E.2d 713, 716 (N.Y. 1983) (quoted in Sanger, supra note 1, at 29).[\/footnote] Nor can deterrence alone account for damages in this case. The Singapore Supreme Court gave no reason to think that the $78,000 will generate incentives that are designed, as Rabin noted, \u201cfor service providers to exercise optimal care\u201d by adopting precautions to prevent such mix-ups, for example, that will cost less than the corresponding injuries that those measures would have averted.[footnote]Rabin, supra note 1, at 230.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nHis chronicling of personality torts points us toward the third purpose about shared values.[footnote]Id. at 233.[\/footnote] Professor Rabin makes a strong case that reproductive injuries resemble the logic of customary pain-and-suffering damages:\r\n<blockquote>The plaintiff\u2019s [enjoyment of] life has been diminished by [the] de\u00adfendant\u2019s negligence in a sense that will reverberate as time unfolds\u2014rather than in the spur-of-the-moment fashion associ\u00adated with most forms of recognized emotional distress.\r\n\r\nLoss of consortium\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. shares the same distinctive temporal dimension. The harm has a similar continuing character in its more modern guise, as loss of companionship[,] [whereby]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [a] breach has been introduced into an embraced pattern of personal relations.[footnote]Id. at 236.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nHis account of damages comes close to capturing the distinct and serious impact that reproductive injuries have on social, physical, and other aspects of wellbeing beyond mental tranquility. Courts tend to regard grief or sorrow as too easy to fake or hard to measure to justify compensation on their own.[footnote]For criticism of the distinction that tort law draws between physical and mental forms of harm, see Dov Fox &amp; Alex Stein, Dualism and Doctrine, 90 Ind. L.J. 975, 985\u201392 (2015).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis skepticism explains the limitations that courts have placed on recovery for emotional distress. Plaintiffs must show that their loss was accompanied by bodily injury, physical impact, or at least its risk from within the \u201czone of danger.\u201d[footnote]See Rabin, supra note 1, at 231\u201332.[\/footnote] Even jurisdictions most receptive to claims of mental harm set an exacting threshold to qualify for compensation.[footnote]See, e.g., Lawson v. Mgmt. Activities, Inc., 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 745, 756 (Ct.

The compensation was not for any out-of-pocket costs that the couple would incur in raising their baby.[footnote]See ACB v. Thomson Med. Pte Ltd.

By holding the clinic liable for breaching its duty to care for the couple\u2019s reproductive interests, the court said that confounded procreation is serious enough to warrant public vindication. The clinic\u2019s mistreatment of the couple would not thereby stand as a lasting marker that their \u201ccommunity did not care to do anything about.\u201d[footnote]Scott Hershovitz, Treating Wrongs as Wrongs: An Expressive Argument for Tort Law, 10 J.

This more tailored kind of interrogation, I argued, should \u201cinform judicial determinations about the circumstances under which a remedy for reproductive negligence may be void for public policy.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 231.[\/footnote] There are plausible reasons to value genetic or gestational ties, for example, without disfavoring adoptive, LGBT, or other families who flourish in the absence of biological kinship. Some prospective parents long to perceive a likeness in their baby\u2019s appearance; they may even believe that such resemblance would help strengthen emotional bonds.[footnote]This ideal of genetic kinship assumes pride of place in the history of United States adoption. That institution was designed to \u201cunite children with parents who looked like them\u201d to \u201cobscure the fact that they had been born to others.\u201d Ellen Herman, Kinship by Design: A History of Adoption in the Modern United States 123, 150 (2008). Adoption agencies and social workers sought above all to bring adoptive parents together with children who resembled them. \u201cEnduring beliefs in the power of blood, and widespread doubts about whether families could thrive without it, fueled ardent efforts to subject adoption to\u201d the social engineering of so-called \u201cnaturalization.\u201d Id. at 7. This matching paradigm reflects the persistent assumption that resemblance between parents and children \u201cexpedited love,\u201d while differences threatened a sense of shared identity, emotional bonding, and family belonging.

[\/footnote] For others, being related to a child through DNA carries cultural or religious meaning that identifies the members of a family or connects them to a common past and future.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 179\u201380.[\/footnote] And certain people may value that connection in ways that others do not. Recovery need not express or reflect disrespect for individuals who defy traditional expectations about parenthood.\r\n\r\nRace sorting in family formation also remains a source of evolving conflict more than moral clarity or social consensus.[footnote]See Dov Fox, Race Sorting in Family Formation, 49 Fam. L.Q. 55, 59 (2015).[\/footnote] The Supreme Court has accordingly exempted child placement decisions from the usual constitutional bar on government decisions based on considerations involving race.[footnote]See Katie Eyer, Constitutional Colorblindness and the Family, 162 U.

And the Singapore couple\u2019s interest in genetic affinity takes the edge off the divisive message their suit might otherwise send. But it is often white parents seeking white offspring, sometimes without biological ties, when those efforts go awry.[footnote]See, e.g., Michael Lasalandra, Woman, Ex and Hospital Settle over Sperm Mixup, Bos.

As a lesbian growing up in a small conservative farm town, Jennifer Cramblett knew the sting of not fitting in. So when she and her long-term partner Amanda Zinkon decided to start a family, they looked for a donor who would at least resemble them. Her doctor recommended Midwest Sperm Bank, with its hundreds of potential donors and detailed profiles to pick from. They carefully selected donor No. 380, who was white like they are. Plus, he had blond hair and blue eyes like Zinkon. (They expected that Cramblett\u2019s traits would already be reflected in the child, since she would be carrying their baby-to-be.) After Cramblett got pregnant, the couple called the sperm bank to order additional samples from the same donor, so that their little girl could have a biological sibling. The receptionist on the phone confirmed: \u201cOkay, you want eight vials of sperm from Donor No. 330,\u201d to which Cramblett replied, \u201cNo, I said\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. No. 380.\u201d Id. at 4. The sperm bank, it turns out, handwrites its records by pen and paper. So whoever had set aside the sample for Cramblett must have mistaken an 8 for a 3. Realizing that the couple was apparently given the wrong sperm, the receptionist clarified whether she \u201chad requested an African American donor.\u201d \u201cWhy would I?\u201d Cramblett answered. \u201cMy partner and I are Caucasian.\u201d Id. at 3\u20136.[\/footnote] The mix-up subjected them to the first-hand experience of their community\u2019s indifference to racial exclusion and the stinging insults of an uncle who \u201cspeaks openly and derisively about persons of color.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 6.[\/footnote] The couple fears that they are woefully ill-equipped with the \u201ccultural competency\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] required to navigate the \u201cchallenges [of] transracial parenting.\u201d[footnote]Complaint at 5, Cramblett v.

See Complaint, supra note 108, at 5\u201311.[\/footnote] I am inclined to agree with the court that the harms these parents suffered find uncomfortable recourse under the law. But my reasons are different. Framed as a response to enduring racial prejudice and disadvantage, recovery could dignify those \u201cprivate biases\u201d to which, the Supreme Court has held in the custody context, \u201cthe law cannot, directly or indirectly, give\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. effect.\u201d[footnote]Palmore v.

This procreation right overreaches when it breathes life into the idea that it is worse for parents to have a child with darker skin or mixed ancestry. Affording relief for the consequent adversities of navigating public life risks sustaining monoracial family whiteness as a socially advantaged norm.[footnote]See Angela Onwuachi-Willig, According to Our Hearts: <em>Rhinelander v.

Id. at 131, 283.[\/footnote] This past cannot help but color what it means for courts to award damages for thwarted efforts to have a white child. That does not mean that policy concerns rule out any remedy at all in cases like Cramblett\u2019s. Courts could still authorize a cause of action that disapproves and disciplines any proven professional wrongdoing. Deterrent compensation could take statutory form in liquidated damages for negligently confounded procreation. This would be a modest, fixed amount for nothing more than the failure to provide competent services. That award would explicitly disclaim inquiry into the more particular nature of reproductive loss.\r\n<h2>III. Rethinking the Theory<\/h2>\r\nProfessor Keating argues that my proposal to remedy reproductive negligence betrays the storied history of tort law and lays bare its conceptual limits. Tort law redresses only \u201charms\u201d sustained to existing things of value that we already have, as future goods\u2014what Keating calls \u201cbenefits\u201d\u2014are not ours yet.[footnote]See Keating, supra note 1, at 218.[\/footnote] This \u201cpreoccupation\u201d with harms over benefits reflects the widely held view that the loss of existing goods is more serious and worthier of relief.[footnote]See id. at 221.[\/footnote] Yet it is unrealized benefits at stake when you get the baby you did not plan for, for example, or do not get the one you did. The tort system is accordingly \u201cinhospitable to the recognition of the reproductive wrongs.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 225.[\/footnote] Professor Keating\u2019s harm\u2013benefit distinction is like the difference between being infected with a disease and being refused the vaccine to prevent it. Infection harms you by impairing a health you had been enjoying, whereas refusing the vaccine imperils only your future health. That loss does not do any <em>harm<\/em>, in Keating\u2019s term; it denies a <em>benefit<\/em>. This threat to future rather than existing goods, however likely and grave, simply is not enough, he argues, to support a claim under existing tort law.[footnote]See id. at 219, 222.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nYet some torts do confer what Keating calls \u201cbenefits.\u201d They redress\u00ad the lost chance of achieving a more favorable outcome or lost \u201copportunity to obtain a better degree of recovery.\u201d[footnote]Lord v. Lovett, 770 A.2d 1103, 1104\u201306 (N.H. 2001). For discussion, see Claire Finkelstein, Is Risk a Harm?, 151 U. Pa. L. Rev. 963, 985\u201386 (2003); Nancy Levit, Ethereal Torts, 61 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 136, 154\u201358 (1992).[\/footnote] So, for example, when an obstetrician\u2019s botched surgery left a woman healthy for now, but at greater risk of bowel obstruction down the road, the court approved compensation for that 8\u201316% chance of future peril.[footnote]Petriello v. Kalman, 576 A.2d 474, 476\u201377, 484 (Conn. 1990).[\/footnote] It is not just doctors who must answer for mistakes that make patients more vulnerable to some physical ailment they do not yet have and might never develop.[footnote]See, e.g., Dickhoff v. Green, 836 N.W.2d 321, 325\u201326 (Minn. 2013).[\/footnote] Accountants can also be held liable under the tort of malpractice for bad investments that lose a client potential income.[footnote]See, e.g., Cast Art Indus. v. KPMG, 36 A.3d 1049, 1051\u201352 (N.J. 2012).[\/footnote] And drunk drivers can be forced to pay for the lost income a victim might otherwise have earned, even when that victim is a child who never had a job in the first place.[footnote]See, e.g., Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Sutton, 765 So. 2d 1269, 1276\u201377 (Miss. 2000).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI will explain shortly why I think that such examples of future-oriented tort awards cannot simply be explained away as proxies for the impairment of existing wealth, health, or companionship, especially as they apply to reproductive negligence.[footnote]See infra notes 146\u2013152 and accompanying text (discussing tort damages for loss of filial consortium).[\/footnote] But for now let us accept Keating\u2019s contention that tort law responds only to harms, not lost benefits. He does recognize that harms and benefits are just \u201cpluses and minuses\u201d on either end of \u201cthe same scale.\u201d[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 222.[\/footnote] Yet tort distinguishes these concepts, in his view, because \u201c[h]arms and benefits stand in very different relations to autonomy.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 223. Keating indeed argues that the whole point of our tort system is to pro\u00admote the very autonomy that Sanger had advised my proposal eschew. See supra notes 23\u201326 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Harms \u201cto our bodies and to our possessions\u201d in particular \u201cimpair[] the principal means at our disposal for\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. exert[ing] our wills upon the world,\u201d[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 217, 223.[\/footnote] Keating argues, whereas the suppression of benefits rarely \u201crob[s] us of our normal and foundational powers of agency.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 223.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis seems too quick. It limits my ability to chart my life course no less just because the identity or project that I throw myself into happens to be a future benefit. Keating has a point that benefits I have not undertaken or enjoyed may not be \u201ccongruent with [my] will[]. To thrust an unsought benefit upon [me] and demand compensation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. for the value conferred\u201d would conscript me in a project that I have not chosen.[footnote]Id. at 223.[\/footnote] Benefits I did not seek out\u2014the vaccine that I never consented to\u2014may thereby deprive me of the very autonomy that Keating says tort law is designed to preserve.\r\n\r\nThe benefits that reproductive negligence frustrates are not, in the first place, unsolicited. It is prospective parents who those procreation rights would protect, after all, not the potential children who could not have asked for any of this. Would-be parents seek out fertility or infertility treatment with the explicit goal of remaining childfree or becoming a caretaker. When a doctor bungles a tubal ligation or drops a tray of embryos, that error foists parenthood or childlessness on people who had made crystal clear their strong preference to the contrary. Reproductive negligence disorders their lives in profound ways that they experience as at least as foreign as any \u201cbroken bones, crippling pain, [or] significant disability.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 215. Keating relies in relevant part here on points developed in Seana Valentine Shiffrin, Harm and Its Moral Significance, 18 Legal Theory 357 (2012).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis leads me to think that Professor Keating draws the harm\u2013benefit asymmetry too sharply and makes too much of it. My quarrel is not just with his descriptive claim that tort law tends, as a general matter, to protect against the withdrawal of existing goods more than it does the withholding of future ones.[footnote]See supra notes 128\u2013130 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] I am also wary of his normative claim about why tort law could not at any rate admit exceptions.[footnote]See Keating, supra note 1, at 214\u201315.[\/footnote] To the extent that tort law privileges harms over benefits, more practical reasons make better sense than autonomy of why. Future benefits are harder to prove and calculate. That they have not happened yet clouds the picture of what might have been, or obscures the value of goods that never were. The uncertainty of that loss does not, however, mean that it can never be projected clearly or confidently enough to sustain redress. Damages should simply be discounted by the chances that some other factor was to blame for having caused that loss, such that procreation would have been imposed, deprived, or confounded just the same even in the absence of wrongdoing.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 189\u201391, 197\u2013200, 206\u201309.[\/footnote] This is just the probabilistic recovery afforded under the loss-of-chance doctrine.[footnote]See id. at 226\u201328.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother uncertainty concerns whether a projected loss will befall the victims, either at all or as severely as anticipated. But again, tort law has sound ways to address that problem. Say it cannot be known whether a child will ultimately develop the genetic disease that a mix-up or misdiagnosis left him susceptible to. Courts could fashion protective remedies like a judicially supervised guardianship or reversionary trust that disburses funds only as the repercussions of that mix-up or misdiagnosis are felt.[footnote]See id. at 208\u201309.[\/footnote] Anything that is left over if and when those consequences dissipate would be returned to the defendant.[footnote]See, e.g., Robak v. United States, 503 F. Supp. 982, 983 (N.D. Ill. 1980), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 658 F.2d 471 (7th Cir. 1981); Garrison v. Med. Ctr. of Del. Inc., 581 A.2d 288, 292 (Del. 1989); Kush v. Lloyd, 616 So. 2d 415, 422\u00ad\u201324 (Fla. 1992); Arche v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 798 P.2d 477, 486\u201387 (Kan. 1990).[\/footnote] Availability of such remedies leave little basis for tort law to deny recovery for the loss of a reasonably expected child-to-be when it readily compensates for the loss of an existing child, even moments after birth.[footnote]Cf. Michael B. Kelly, The Rightful Position in \u201cWrongful Life\u201d Actions, 42 Hastings L.J. 505, 558 (1991) (arguing that wrongful-birth torts protect expectation interests by focusing recovery on \u201cthe difference between the cost of raising a healthy child, which the parents expected and were willing to pay, and the cost of raising an impaired child, which the parents did not expect\u201d).[\/footnote] Of course, the newborn has already arrived to us in the here and now, while the yet-to-be born fetus or embryo may never have. But this uncertainty need not affect liability. Instead, courts should, at the damages stage, reduce awards based on the odds that \u201ca couple\u2019s age and other circum\u00adstances would have given them\u201d to achieve \u201cpregnancy and live birth\u201d had misconduct not reduced those chances they had.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 199.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is \u201ceasier to visualize what was at stake,\u201d Professor Steven Smith argues, when the sound of a baby\u2019s gentle cry or touch of her hand wrapping around one\u2019s finger \u201care actual memories and not just conceptual possibilities.\u201d[footnote]Steven D.

L.J. 590, 603 (2002).[\/footnote] Whereas the newborn assumes an unmistakable place in her parents\u2019 world, it may \u201crequire an act of imagination to appreciate the value that could have been realized with a potential person who never actually came into living, breathing existence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 597\u201398.[\/footnote] What parenthood will involve or mean is hazier when \u201cthere is no actual child\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. for the couple\u2019s reflections to distill around.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 602.[\/footnote] But when their expectation was well founded, the loss of that relationship-to-be is still real and serious.[footnote]See Jill Wieber Lens, Recognizing Invisible Death 9\u201310 (2018) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (noting that understandings of and reactions to stillbirth have evolved over time).[\/footnote] Refusal to recognize that harm underestimates tort\u2019s conceptual agility.\r\n\r\nCourts already measure damages for lost consortium and enjoyment of life as a function of losses that have not yet come to pass.[footnote]JoEllen Lind, Valuing Relationships: The Role of Damages for Loss of Society, 35 N.M. L. Rev. 301, 303 &amp; n.14 (2005).[\/footnote] Professor JoEllen Lind observes that these awards thereby \u201cexhibit the forward-looking, expectation attributes of contract law.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 305.[\/footnote] Lost wages look to future losses too. Consortium damages, for their part, \u201cfocus on the missed opportunity\u201d of human interaction that \u201cwould have flourished over time\u201d had misconduct not impaired that relationship.[footnote]Id. at 302, 305. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [\/footnote] This future-oriented feature of consortium damages makes sense of why some courts do not condition their award on a potential child\u2019s having been born. When a reckless driver took the life of a pregnant woman, the Iowa Supreme Court allowed her husband to recover consortium damages for the seven-and-a-half-month-old fetus as well.[footnote]Dunn v. Rose Way, Inc., 333 N.W.2d 830, 831, 834 (Iowa 1983).[\/footnote] That \u201closs certainly does not vanish because the deprivation occurred prior to birth,\u201d the court held.[footnote]Id. at 833.[\/footnote] \u201cTo the deprived parent the loss is real either way.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] The unborn need not be treated as persons with legal interests of their own for prospective parents to have \u201cdeveloped a relationship with them,\u201d as one Arizona court made clear in awarding consortium damages in a medical malpractice suit for loss of stillborn twins.[footnote]Burnham v. Miller, 972 P.2d 645, 647 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1998).[\/footnote] It was enough that it was reasonable for the parents to have \u201cdeveloped love for them and expectations for their future.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt strains the imagination to conjure the defeated benefits when imposed or confounded procreation leaves a person with the baby she did not have before and specifically sought to avoid. One need only think of the lost sleep, freedom, or time for other existing kids or projects outside the family that are central to her life enjoyment. Professor Keating argues that these future goods were mere benefits because she did not have them already, so they cannot be treated as autonomously hers. Acquiring the benefits may have \u201cenlarge[d] the reach\u201d of her will, but losing them does not impair it.[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 217.[\/footnote] This strikes me as a distinction without a difference. Why should it matter that she did not have those things so long as she had good reason to expect them and plan her life accordingly? Keating\u2019s answer sounds less in the legal outcome than its mechanics. He would not deny compensation for reproductive negligence. He would just look else\u00adwhere for authority. Tort law is <em>protective<\/em>, he might say, not <em>productive<\/em> like contract is. But when misconduct imposes, deprives, or confounds procreation, it does not really protect against the kind of bad outcomes that make people worse off; it just fails to produce good ones that would have improved their lot.\r\n\r\nTort is limited to \u201cinteractions in which one of the parties detri\u00admen\u00adtally changes the position of the other,\u201d is how Professor Ronen Perry puts it; contract applies when \u201cone of the parties promised something to the other and in so doing created an expectation that did not formerly exist.\u201d[footnote]Ronen Perry, It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, 93 Cornell L. Rev. 329, 383 (2008).[\/footnote] Keating echoes the sentiment that Perry expressed in a different context: \u201c[S]ince the Gordian knot of tort law cannot be untied, it must be cut altogether. We must replace the traditional tort framework, which gives rise to an insoluble problem, with a more promising contractual framework.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 398 (discussing wrongful-life suits).[\/footnote] Keating argues that contract better addresses the thwarted exercise of one person\u2019s will together with another\u2019s for their mutual \u201ccreation and protection of legitimate expectations of future benefit.\u201d[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 218.[\/footnote] Sanger, too, had noted the allure of contract law in describing the angst that \u201cdisappointed plaintiffs\u201d sustain when \u201cthey [don\u2019t] get what they bargained and paid for\u2014competent medical treatment\u2014toward a reproductive goal.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 38.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIndeed, U.S. courts have increasingly adopted a freedom-of-contract framework, for example, to adjudicate reproductive disputes between surrogates and the intended parents.[footnote]Deborah S. Mazer, Born Breach: The Challenge of Remedies in Surrogacy Contracts, 28 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 211, 218\u201319 (2017).[\/footnote] Contract enforcement is limited even in this context, however. A salient example comes from agreed-to terms about whether to selectively reduce a multiple-order pregnancy or terminate a single fetus diagnosed with an anomaly.[footnote]See, e.g., Dov Fox, Surrogacy Contracts, Abortion Conditions, and Parenting Licenses, Bill of Health (June 7, 2016), http:\/\/blogs.harvard.edu\/billofhealth\/2016\/06\/07\/surrogacy-contracts-abortion-conditions-and-parenting-licenses-in-the-curious-case-of-cook-v-harding\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/79VW-CX9M].[\/footnote] And besides, social and economic forces, I had noted, relieve most family-planning specialists of the usual market pressures to assure the results of their care.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 172\u201374.[\/footnote] So as a practical matter, there is rarely any \u201cbargained and paid for\u201d agreement to enforce against mishandled reproductive outcomes.[footnote]See id. at 173.[\/footnote] Most family-planning specialists even insist that patients sign clauses that shield reproductive specialists from liability for even implied breach.[footnote]A typical indemnification-and-liquidated-damages clause comes from the standard contract used by the country\u2019s leading sperm bank. California Cryobank requires anyone who wants to use one of its donors to start a family to sign this: \u201cClient agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Cryobank\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. against any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, offsets, causes of action and expenses\u201d resulting from \u201cany possible loss, degradation, spoilage, contamination or the like of any portion or all of the semen for any reason, including but without limitation, as a result of Cryobank\u2019s negligence.\u201d Cal. Cryobank, Donor Semen Services Agreement 3\u20134, http:\/\/cryobank.com\/uploadedFiles\/\r\nCryobankcom\/_forms\/pdf\/documents\/PurchaseStorageAgreement.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/J6JG-84TH]. Nor does Cryobank make any guarantees about the quality or viability of specimens.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMore fundamentally, however, contract misses tort law\u2019s emphasis on the distinctively abiding forms of obligation that family planners are owed by specialists ranging from obstetricians, pharmacists, and embry\u00adologists to fertility clinics, sperm banks, and surrogacy agencies. Each assumes practice-specific responsibilities that they cannot waive to the individuals they take on as patients or clients.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 215\u201316.[\/footnote] This commitment to their interests in pregnancy, parenthood, or particulars does more than either fill in contractual gaps in the name of justice or modify agreements for good faith or fair dealing.[footnote]See Perry, supra note 154, at 382.[\/footnote] Nondisclaimable duties of professional care are tort law\u2019s chief attraction in a context like reproductive medicine, in which people entrust professionals to carry out a cherished social practice with far-reaching life consequences.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 170.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPerhaps this explains why Professor Keating ultimately gestures toward a compound approach to reproductive negligence that would be part tort, part contract:\r\n<blockquote>What we need is a hybrid legal regime that borrows from both tort and contract law. An adequate regime would take from tort law the principle that duties of care are binding and inalienable. It would take from contract law both a concern with fashioning the terms on which the assistance of others may be enlisted and a regime of remedies designed to address cases in which malfea\u00adsance results in the failure to realize a legitimate expectation of benefit.[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 227.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nI have no principled objection to grafting tort\u2019s duty of reproductive care onto contract law\u2019s enforcement of cooperative efforts between patients and providers. There is indeed precedent for this chimeric sort of action in the liability doctrine that governs product-borne injuries to persons or property.\r\n\r\nProducts liability started out in contract law.[footnote]See David G. Owen, The Evolution of Products Liability Law, 26 Rev. Litig. 955, 967\u201369 (2007).[\/footnote] Consumer transactions were governed exclusively by assurances made in the course of commercial marketing that the vended goods, for example, exhibited quality sufficient to make them fit for sale.[footnote]See Robert L. Rabin, Restating the Law: The Dilemmas of Products Liability, 30 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 197, 199\u2013200 (1997).[\/footnote] The twentieth century marked a transformation in products liability, however, toward tort actions like negligent misrepre\u00adsentation and strict liability for design defects.[footnote]Products liability was pushed beyond a negligence standard to strict liability by Justice Roger Traynor, first in concurrence, Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., 150 P.2d 436, 440\u00ad\u201341 (Cal. 1944) (Traynor, J., concurring), and later for a unanimous California Supreme Court, Greenman v. Yuba Power Prods., Inc., 377 P.2d 897, 901 (Cal. 1963).[\/footnote] Exemplifying this turn is the celebrated 1916 case about the driver who was injured when the wooden wheel on his Buick collapsed.[footnote]MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916).[\/footnote] The New York Court of Appeals held the manufacturer liable even though it had sold the automobile to the dealer without promising that it would work.[footnote]See id. at 1052\u201354.[\/footnote] The absence of contract elements was no barrier to recovery. Judge Benjamin Cardozo explained:\r\n<blockquote>We have put aside the notion that the duty to safeguard life and limb, when the consequences of negligence may be foreseen, grows out of contract and nothing else. We have put the source of the obligation where it ought to be. We have put its source in the law.[footnote]Id. at 1053.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\n\u201cThe law\u201d where he placed this duty is tort, justly celebrated for its moral imagination.[footnote]See, e.g., Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 37\u201338 (1881).[\/footnote] Tort is uniquely equipped to accommodate new forms of wrongfully inflicted harm that merit protection in the absence of explicit or implicit warranty. This common law was capacious enough to protect against injuries that could be traced to defective car parts on distant assembly lines. So too should it guard against forced pregnancy or robbed parenthood at the hands of family planning specialists.\r\n\r\nTo remedy reproductive negligence, tort law need not resign itself to freewheeling policy or sacrifice its conceptual integrity on the altar of justice. Keating divides the work of\u00ad tort and contract in terms of whether an injured party suffered the loss of an existing or future good, a harm or a benefit. I would draw the doctrinal boundaries differently. Tort law is for those injuries that society has determined it will not stand for, whether or not a more vulnerable party secured assurances against their infliction. Contract is for other injuries, those that we have not declared intolerable, but that parties have made agreements about on their own. By demoting contract law to this private-ordering role, I do not mean to suggest that it should be \u201creabsorbed into the mainstream of \u2018tort.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Grant Gilmore, The Death of Contract 95 (1974).[\/footnote] My point is only that tort can do without help from contract law in holding professionals to account for wrongfully imposing, depriving, or confounding procreation. And given the practical limits that beset contract enforcement, like the political challenges that stand in the way of public regulation, the clarion call of tort awards may for now be the best that we can do.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\n\u201cPlanning procreation,\u201d Professor Sanger reminds us, \u201chas never been a surefire enterprise.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 38. Sanger speculates that \u201c[t]he focus on planning may reflect a generational difference.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [I]n the past there were fewer treatments for infertility and so the medical profession had little to offer,\u201d while today \u201cmore women are likely to have entered the zone of concern because they are actively seeking pregnancy later in their life span.\u201d Id. at 38\u201339. She \u201cwonder[s] as well if there is a millennial\u2014or more likely a Gen X\u2014expectation of control over other things as well, connected in part to a faith in technology and invention.\u201d Id. at 39.[\/footnote] But neither is riding a car or preparing a meal or all kinds of risky activities that our legal system has nothing to say about when food contamination or car accidents happen. And our laws still respond to those harms when a responsible party\u2014such as a meat producer or drunk driver\u2014is to blame for having caused them. Sanger is right that \u201closs of control\u201d can sometimes shade into \u201cacceptance\u201d of the reproductive fate that negligence victims are dealt.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Not always, or even often perhaps; but maybe, and certainly sometimes. She points to the striking portrait that emerges from author Andrew Solomon\u2019s <em>Far from the Tree<\/em>. His book tells the story of 300 families who \u201clearn to tolerate, accept and finally celebrate children who are not what they originally had in mind.\u201d[footnote]Andrew Solomon, Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity 5 (2012).[\/footnote] Solomon bears witness to how these parents of chil\u00addren\u2014with deafness or dwarfism, Down syndrome or schizophrenia, pro\u00addigious talents or transgender identity\u2014find themselves \u201cfalling in love with someone they didn\u2019t yet know enough to want.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 47.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe tenacity of parental love does not, however, diminish the legitimate interest in choosing offspring particulars, or the real losses to life plans or identities when that interest is wrongfully frustrated. Solomon also captures the episodic despair, isolation, and indignation of even the most resilient parents. And our law does not ordinarily condition legal relief for unjustly inflicted adversities on whether victims are able to abide or come to terms with them. Nor does it immunize wrongdoers from liability just because plaintiffs tough it out or find consolation in how things ended up. It makes no difference for remediation purposes that most \u201cparents with moderate coping skills\u201d do not \u201csuffer lasting grief or family dysfunction,\u201d for example, when flawed prenatal tests lead them to \u201chave a child with a disabling condition.\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 235.[\/footnote] It is enough to support a claim against the specialist at fault that the parents had \u201cwish[ed] to forgo the emotional, physical, and financial pressures of hospital visits, medical expenses, and special education that caring for a child with special needs can entail.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat parents will value the relationship with a child whose features reproductive negligence rendered unanticipated or unfamiliar does not make that error harmless or that harm noncompensable. A longstanding tort doctrine was designed to remedy just this sort of injury by mitigating damages \u201c[w]here the defendant\u2019s [harmfully] tortious conduct\u201d has at the same time \u201cconferred upon the plaintiff a special benefit.\u201d[footnote]Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a0920 (1939).[\/footnote] This benefit-offset rule eschews all-or-nothing awards in favor of one that balances the harms that misconduct caused against any countervailing benefits that it brought along with it as well.[footnote]See Jones v. Malinowski, 473 A.2d 429, 436\u201337 (Md. 1984) (holding that the \u201cjury must assess the[] benefits\u201d of a slipshod sterilization \u201cin light of the circumstances of the particular case\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. taking into account\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. family size and income, age of the parents and other relevant factors\u201d to determine whether the negligently wrought reproductive outcome nevertheless benefits the parents).[\/footnote] Courts have criticized this approach for \u201ccomparing apples and oranges, that is, involving highly speculative and unquantifiable damages in contrast to intangible bene\u00adfits.\u201d[footnote]Smith v. Gore, 728 S.W.2d 738, 743 (Tenn. 1987).[\/footnote] They have a point. There is no precise way to work out and tally up harms and benefits in having the kind of child that you actually did instead of some counterfactual one you did not. The undeniable complexity of trying to tease apart or add up what parents experience as good or bad does not, however, warrant refusing compensation or deterrence outright.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 218\u201319 (observing that courts approximate damages for woolly losses to life, liberty, and dignity in matters of fiduciary breach, privacy intrusion, and lack of informed consent).[\/footnote] Better to identify these tradeoffs with care than \u201cto permit the law to be blinded to the realities of the plaintiff\u2019s concrete situation for the sake of indef\u00adinite\u00a0abstractions.\u201d[footnote]<em>Smith<\/em>, 728 S.W.2d at 744.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFertility treatment is not just some consumer indulgence. The choices we make about family formation dramatically shape our lives and the meaning they have for us. Misrepresented donors, misimplanted embryos, and misdiagnosed fetuses may be first-world problems; but they are not frivolous nor trivial harms. And they cannot be chalked up to occasional and honest mistakes like the inevitable slip of the hand or reasonable lapse in judgment. Their causes more often lie instead in the unsanitized laboratories, uncalibrated equipment, and unreliable quality controls that a regulatory vacuum makes predictable. These are clear breaches of the professional duty of care that sperm banks, IVF clinics, and OB\/GYN doctors owe to those whose reproductive interests they agree to serve. They are wrongs in need of rights.",

But available data points are jarring. A 2008 survey of nearly half of all U.S. fertility clinics found that more than one in five had misdiagnosed, mislabeled, or mishandled reproductive materials.[footnote]See Susannah Baruch, David Kaufman &amp; Kathy L.

Regulators, insurers, and professional societies do not require sound practices or fail-safe protections. Governments, review platforms, and medical boards decline to record mistakes. There is no systematic reporting, even of transgressions like embryo mix-ups and freezer failures that resemble so-called never events. These are the most serious and preventable kind of patient harms\u2014surgery on the wrong body part or patient, for example\u2014that most states track by legislative mandate elsewhere in health care delivery.[footnote]See Dov Fox, Transparency Challenges in Reproductive Health Care, <em>in<\/em> Transparency in Health and Health Care: Legal and Ethical Possibilities and Limits (I.

My inquiry began with this puzzle: Why does the American legal system turn a blind eye to the wrongful frustration of efforts to pursue or avoid procreation\u2014however egregious the misconduct or devastating the injury?\r\n\r\nPublic law is part of the story. Congressional refusal to fund research involving human embryos freed the fertility industry since its emergence in the early 1980s to develop less as a medical practice than as a trade business. It is not just its free-market origins that insulate procreation-related services from meaningful state or federal oversight. Sterilization, surrogacy, and embryo selection\u2014these all are mired in complex controver\u00adsies about sex, pregnancy, and family life that cut across partisan divides.[footnote]See June Carbone &amp; Naomi Cahn, Embryo Fundamentalism, 18 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts. J. 1015, 1032 (2010).[\/footnote] There ideological tensions obscure the electoral risks of regulation, even in jurisdictions that are reliably red or blue. For example, progressive feminists disalign with disability-rights advocates on abortion protections related to fetal misdiagnosis of genetic abnormality.[footnote]See Marsha Saxton, Disability Rights and Selective Abortion, <em>in<\/em> The Disability Studies Reader 105, 112 (Lennard J. Davis ed., 2006). [\/footnote] Botched IVF, meanwhile, fragments much of the conservative coalition that celebrates the blessing of having children.[footnote]See Henry T. Greely, The End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction 167\u201368 (2016).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI focused less on the political economy of reproductive medicine, however, than on why our legal regime goes so easy on transgressions that disrupt this far-reaching domain of human life. I canvassed the constellation of reasons why reproductive negligence falls through the cracks of contract, property, and torts.[footnote]See id. at 164\u201375.[\/footnote] It goes beyond familiar suspicion of claims about intangible harm or fraudulent suits by parents who, having failed \u201cto exercise restraint or take responsibility,\u201d for example, might simply \u201cinvent an intent to prevent pregnancy.\u201d[footnote]Nell v.

Indeed, it lacks even a practical way to think or talk about them.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 156.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI introduced a comprehensive framework of reproductive wrongs.[footnote]See id. at 176\u201380.[\/footnote] Some <em>impose<\/em> unwanted procreation.[footnote]See id. at 184\u201390; see also id. at 191\u201393 (explaining that the duty-mitigation doctrine holds that it is unreasonable to insist that women try having an abortion or giving a child up for adoption to make them eligible for recovery otherwise owed).[\/footnote] Others <em>deprive<\/em> parenthood from those who long for it.[footnote]See id. at 193\u2013200.[\/footnote] Others still <em>confound<\/em> plans not just for any child, but for one born with or without particular genetic traits.[footnote]See id. at 200\u201309.[\/footnote] I proposed corresponding causes of action that peg damages for successful claims to two factors.[footnote]See id. at 209\u201324.[\/footnote] First is how badly the injury harms the parents or prospective parents. Severity depends on the reasons they sought treatment and the repercussions of its defeat.[footnote]See id. at 224\u201326.[\/footnote] The second asks the extent to which trans\u00adgressions were to blame. The greater chances that the reproductive loss can be chalked up to user error, preexisting infertility, or genetic uncertainty, the lower the awards.[footnote]See id. at 226\u201330.[\/footnote] I also spelled out circumstances under which judges should void compensation on policy grounds as a violation of public interest or morality.[footnote]See id. at 231\u201340.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe commentaries by Professors Sanger, Rabin, and Keating refine and elevate these themes that I had sought to develop. I focus here on three of the hardest questions they tackle. First, Professor Sanger asks, what is the central harm when doctors or scientists upend people\u2019s plans about having children? Does negligence rob them of whatever measure of autonomous choice or control competent care would have let them exercise over whether, when, how, or with whom to reproduce? Or is the real injury the more workaday ways in which those thwarted decisions encroach on a life that is either free of childrearing\u2019s unwanted burdens or enriched by its sought-after blessings?\r\n\r\nProfessor Rabin moves the ball from the injuries sustained to the remedies owed. He situates legal relief within the common-law evolution of personality torts that range from false imprisonment to intrusion on privacy. In light of this history, he interrogates whether courthouse claims for reproductive negligence should take form in one overarching cause of action\u2014a single, unified right\u2014or the multiple more specific sticks that its unbundling reveals. And, tackling the most provocative among these, he urges me to clarify how such right(s) should recognize and compensate confounded efforts to have offspring who share genetic ties or racial resemblance. Finally, Professor Keating explores whether defeated attempts at parenthood, or freedom from it, are the kinds of loss that our tort system is built to protect against. Is tort compensation limited, he asks, to the impairment of existing things of value to us that we had already come to enjoy? Or can torts redress the loss of future goods that it was reasonable for us to expect? The pages that follow address these issues and related ones that Professors Sanger, Rabin, and Keating raise along the way.\r\n<h2>I. Identifying the Injury<\/h2>\r\nProfessor Sanger presses me to clarify \u201cthe nature of the harm\u201d at stake when procreation is wrongfully imposed, deprived, or confounded.[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 36.[\/footnote] She resists my \u201cattempt to connect the proposal for this new tort to the idea of autonomy\u201d that \u201cis already vindicated in the abortion jurispru\u00addence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 37.[\/footnote] The rhetoric of choice carries political baggage, she points out. Autonomy talk is rife with pejorative \u201cconnotations of consumer\u00adism and self-satisfaction\u201d that make it an \u201cunsympathetic strategy.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [\/footnote] More critically, Sanger argues, the real harm that reproductive negligence causes has less to do with choices than consequences. This injury \u201cis not the loss of control over [family] planning,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut rather the loss of what the plan meant to produce.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 36.[\/footnote] It is true that at times I referred to that harm in terms of choice or control.[footnote]See id. at 36\u201338.[\/footnote] But I never said that the individual\u2019s ability to make central life decisions for herself is the only or best reason to guard against botched fertility or infertility treatment. The \u201cinterests in making\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. decisions about pregnancy, parenthood, and offspring particu\u00adlars vindicate not just decisional autonomy (how freely she chooses),\u201d I underscored, \u201cbut also individual well-being (how well such outcomes help her live).\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 177 (\u201cWhatever satisfaction a person gets from knowing that the reproductive experiences she prizes are of her own making, it matters at least as much the ways in which those experiences help her to live well\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] Reproductive negligence characteristicall\u00ady inflicts concrete harms to core life projects and relationships.\r\n\r\nThis is how my introduction had framed what Sanger calls the \u201cspectral tangibleness\u201d of that loss:[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 38.[\/footnote]\r\n<blockquote>Determinations about having children tend\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to shape who people are, what they do, and how they want to be remembered. Many people find profound meaning and fulfillment either in pregnancy and parenthood or else in the aims or attachments that freedom from those roles facilitates. That is why the wrongful frustration of reproductive plans disrupts personal and profes\u00adsional lives in predictable and dramatic ways.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 155 (footnotes omitted); see also id. at 220 (arguing that \u201c[f]ew practices\u201d so gravely implicate \u201chealth, peace of mind, and livelihoods\u201d).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nI did not mean to cast autonomy in a leading role. And I agree that it cedes center stage to the real-world impacts when people who enlisted profes\u00adsionals to have \u201cno baby, a baby, and a special baby,\u201d in Sanger\u2019s terms, \u201cinstead received a baby, no baby, and the wrong kind of baby.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 32.[\/footnote] This \u201cfocus on well-being,\u201d my essay concluded, \u201cexplains the privileged status that procreation holds in our constitutional tradition better than predominant accounts based on autonomy or equality alone.\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 241.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnd yet autonomy deserves more than a cameo appearance. That value commands authority from its distinctive place in the jurisprudence of contraception and abortion.[footnote]See id. at 37.[\/footnote] The Supreme Court has laid emphasis on choice and control in affording fundamental-rights status to determina\u00adtions as \u201cprivate and sensitive\u201d[footnote]Carey v. Population Servs. Int\u2019l, 431 U.S. 678, 685 (1977).[\/footnote] as whether to initiate a pregnancy, and as \u201cintimate and personal\u201d[footnote]Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992) (plurality opinion) (O\u2019Connor, Kennedy &amp; Souter, JJ.).[\/footnote] as whether to keep it. There are limits to what we can learn from this constitutional emphasis on self-determination in matters of bodily integrity. It does not tell us, for example, whether procreation without sex (IVF) merits less protection than sex without procreation (the Pill),[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 219\u201320.[\/footnote] or whether courts should redress foiled efforts to select donors or embryos based on sex, race, or disability.[footnote]See id. at 221\u201322. For discussion of why I would permit recovery for confounded heredity but not race, see infra notes 93\u2013116 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] But it does make autonomy a natural perch from which to build out the case for broader reproductive protections.\r\n\r\nThe tension that Professor Sanger spotlights between choices and consequences plays out in a pioneering decision abroad. A few months ago, a Singapore couple won their suit against the clinic that swapped the husband\u2019s sperm with a stranger\u2019s.[footnote]ACB v. Thomson Med. Pte Ltd. [2017] SGCA 20 (Sing.).[\/footnote] The case reached the highest level of the Supreme Court of Singapore. It held the clinic liable for having upended the couple\u2019s plans to have a child with whom they would be \u201cbound by ties of blood and share physical traits.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 128.[\/footnote] The court called the case \u201cone of the most difficult\u201d in its history.[footnote]Id. at para. 210.[\/footnote] The unanimous opinion relied on <em>Reproductive Negligence<\/em> to establish a first-of-its-kind right to recover for the wrongful denial of \u201cgenetic continuity and biological lineage.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 128 (citing Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 179).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe court framed that injury in terms of both \u201cthe frustration of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. decisional autonomy\u201d as well as \u201cthe substantive impact that it has had on\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. well-being.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 130 (citing Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 174).[\/footnote] The mix-up \u201cdislocate[d]\u201d the couple\u2019s \u201creproductive plans\u201d for \u201cbiological parenthood.\u201d[footnote]Id. at paras. 125\u2013126.[\/footnote] It also had profound effects on them.[footnote]Id. at para. 147 (noting the \u201cunique\u201d harms that \u201cvary depending on the particular reasons fertility treatment was sought, the precise manner in which the negligence took place, and the personal circumstances of the plaintiff (such as the presence of other children or the familial and\/or cultural histories particular to him or her)\u201d (citing Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 219\u201320)).[\/footnote] The court noted the \u201canguish, stigma, disconcertment, and embarrassment\u201d they were reminded of every time a friend or stranger asked about the \u201cwife\u2019s fidelity and the paternity of [their] child[].\u201d[footnote]Id. at paras. 133, 150.[\/footnote] Wellbeing is what mattered more. But autonomy also helped to justify the need for redress. And its setback in such cases helps to round out a more complete account of the harm that reproductive negligence inflicts.\r\n\r\nThis loss of autonomy also explains my misgivings about Sanger\u2019s proposal to recognize a separate tort for negligence in childbirth. She calls salutary attention to the gendered character of reproductive interests.[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 39\u201342. Prenatal and postpartum experiences and expectations place singular demands on women\u2019s bodies, time, identities, and resources, for example, in ways that encroach on their \u201chealth and sexual freedom, their ability to enter and end relationships, their education and job training, their ability to provide for their families, and their ability to negotiate work-family conflicts in institutions organized [along] traditional sex-role assumptions.\u201d Reva B. Siegel, Sex Equality Arguments for Reproductive Rights: Their Critical Basis and Evolving Constitutional Expression, 56 Emory L.J. 815, 819 (2007).[\/footnote] Besides the three interests that I had distinguished in pregnancy (gestating a fetus), parenthood (raising a child), and particulars (selecting offspring traits), Sanger identifies a separate interest specific to childbirth in matters of labor and delivery. These cases involve medical mistakes that lead a woman to get the epidural injection for pain relief that she had expressly declined, for instance, or to deliver via Cesarean section instead of the vaginal birth that she strongly preferred.[footnote]See, e.g., Pemberton v. Tallahassee Med. Ctr., 66 F. Supp. 2d 1247, 1250 (N.D. Fla. 1999); Schreiber v. Physicians Ins. Co., 579 N.W.2d 730, 735\u201336 (Wis. Ct. App. 1998).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI would still exclude this interest from the new forms of protection that I proposed for the other three. These child-delivery errors have \u201cbeen neglected in torts\u201d for their own reasons,[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 44. Birthing mishaps have been overlooked, Sanger points out, because \u201chistorically, birthing women often expected to die during labor and rarely sued for physical harms that resulted from obstetric malpractice,\u201d while \u201c[m]ore recently, the fetus has become the primary patient in labor, similarly obscuring women\u2019s harms and their convictions about claiming them.\u201d Id. at 44\u201345 (citing Jamie R. Abrams, Distorted and Diminished Tort Claims for Women, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 1955, 1978\u201379 (2013)).[\/footnote] separate from policy concerns about the sanctity of life or the unease our legal system harbors toward the value of intangible reproductive loss.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 154, 159.[\/footnote] Faulty C-sections or epidurals implicate the physical harm or unconsented touching that qualify them for malpractice claims and pain-and-suffering damages.[footnote]The incursion on bodily integrity also provides the legal hook to recover for associated emotional distress. See Abrams, supra note 48, at 1968.[\/footnote] These material setbacks are precisely what is missing when providers switch donors, drop embryos, or misdiagnose fetuses.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 176\u201384.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nProfessor Rabin convinces me that the unitary action I proposed to remedy these injuries would be improved by dividing it into three.[footnote]See Rabin, supra note 1, at 233\u201335.[\/footnote] I had acknowledged the risk that reliance on any overarching right \u201ccould dissolve into disarray if its protections are too nebulous to implement\u201d across interests in pregnancy, parenthood, and particulars that \u201cresist consolidation into any one identical injury or claim.\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 211.[\/footnote] In the end, however, I was drawn to the flexibility of an overarching tort that could more smoothly adapt to inevitable changes in reproductive culture or technology.[footnote]See id. at 151, 159, 241.[\/footnote] Even in the months \u201csince Fox\u2019s essay was published,\u201d Professor Sanger notes, \u201cscientists for the first time successfully edited out a mutant gene from a human embryo.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 31.[\/footnote] Meanwhile, \u201cinnovations in genetics and stem cell research [may soon] make embryo selection\u201d for many more traits a common feature of reproductive life, thereby \u201cexpanding the possibilities for negligence.\u201d[footnote]Id. (citing Greely, supra note 11, at 1\u20132).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDespite the appeal of this single-tort approach, courthouse claims demand greater precision, Professor Rabin shows.[footnote]Rabin cogently analogizes my three reproductive-negligence torts to the four rights of privacy. See Rabin, supra note 1, at 233\u201335.[\/footnote] The wrongful disruption of plans to reproduce or not with particular traits in mind implicate discrete defenses and damages that judges and juries would risk running together under a monolithic right.[footnote]See id. at 233.[\/footnote] The fertility clinic that loses a cancer survivor\u2019s sperm or contaminates a couple\u2019s embryos leaves them with an empty cradle.[footnote]See id. at 234\u201335.[\/footnote] By contrast, the doctor who misprescribes birth control or overstates the risk of ending a pregnancy leaves women to carry or raise a child they were unable to.[footnote]See id. at 234.[\/footnote] And neither of these claims is quite like the swapping of reproductive donors or materials.[footnote]See id. at 235.[\/footnote] Rabin would disentangle the torts into the three separate wrongs that I had identified as procreation deprived, imposed, and confounded. I embrace his amendment wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis important revision brings us back to the Singapore mix-up. Sanger does well to worry in cases like this whether \u201csome parents might find themselves receiving less in compensation for\u201d the \u201cnonwhite child\u201d they got in place of a lighter-skinned one.[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 35.[\/footnote] That the donor here was Indian\u2014his complexion darker than the couple of German and Chinese descent\u2014forced the court to consider \u201cthe complex role that physical resemblance, race, and cultural and ethnic identity have had and continue to have on our individual well-being.\u201d[footnote]ACB v. Thomson Med. Pte Ltd. [2017] SGCA 20 (Sing.) at paras. 6, 8, 134.[\/footnote] The wife\u2019s affidavit singled out the baby\u2019s \u201cdifferent skin tone\u201d as the striking feature that \u201cnever fails to draw curious looks from the public\u201d and \u201cturn joyous family time into depressing moments.\u201d[footnote]Id. at para. 130.[\/footnote] Being born conspicuously browner than her parents, the justices noted, would leave the child and her family susceptible to the \u201cracist bullying\u201d of \u201cabusive and derogative comments and hurtful name calling.\u201d[footnote]Id. at paras. 132\u2013133 (discussing A &amp; B v.

Refining the Remedy<\/h2>\r\nBut what, exactly, is that money <em>for<\/em>? I gave three reasons to remedy reproductive negligence: to compensate victims, deter professional miscon\u00adduct, and affirm values. I laid emphasis on the first two.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 211\u201313.[\/footnote] Professors Sanger and Rabin persuade me that the third deserves more. If the main point was compensation, why limit damages to those like this couple injured by professional wrongdoing? I would not provide recovery, Sanger observes, to those who suffer the same disruption of genetic ties due to infertility, infidelity, or misrepre\u00adsentation.[footnote]See Sanger, supra note 1, at 29.[\/footnote] A companion\u2019s deceit, however shameful, doesn\u2019t breach formal duty of reproductive care between sexual partners who are generally presumed equally capable of affirming their own respective interests.[footnote]When a man resists paying child support for a child he unwittingly conceived, courts have accordingly chided him that his partner\u2019s having lied about using birth control \u201cin no way limited his [own] right to [have] use[d] contraception.\u201d L. Pamela P. v. Frank S., 449 N.E.2d 713, 716 (N.Y. 1983) (quoted in Sanger, supra note 1, at 29).[\/footnote] Nor can deterrence alone account for damages in this case. The Singapore Supreme Court gave no reason to think that the $78,000 will generate incentives that are designed, as Rabin noted, \u201cfor service providers to exercise optimal care\u201d by adopting precautions to prevent such mix-ups, for example, that will cost less than the corresponding injuries that those measures would have averted.[footnote]Rabin, supra note 1, at 230.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nHis chronicling of personality torts points us toward the third purpose about shared values.[footnote]Id. at 233.[\/footnote] Professor Rabin makes a strong case that reproductive injuries resemble the logic of customary pain-and-suffering damages:\r\n<blockquote>The plaintiff\u2019s [enjoyment of] life has been diminished by [the] de\u00adfendant\u2019s negligence in a sense that will reverberate as time unfolds\u2014rather than in the spur-of-the-moment fashion associ\u00adated with most forms of recognized emotional distress.\r\n\r\nLoss of consortium\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. shares the same distinctive temporal dimension. The harm has a similar continuing character in its more modern guise, as loss of companionship[,] [whereby]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [a] breach has been introduced into an embraced pattern of personal relations.[footnote]Id. at 236.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nHis account of damages comes close to capturing the distinct and serious impact that reproductive injuries have on social, physical, and other aspects of wellbeing beyond mental tranquility. Courts tend to regard grief or sorrow as too easy to fake or hard to measure to justify compensation on their own.[footnote]For criticism of the distinction that tort law draws between physical and mental forms of harm, see Dov Fox &amp; Alex Stein, Dualism and Doctrine, 90 Ind. L.J. 975, 985\u201392 (2015).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis skepticism explains the limitations that courts have placed on recovery for emotional distress. Plaintiffs must show that their loss was accompanied by bodily injury, physical impact, or at least its risk from within the \u201czone of danger.\u201d[footnote]See Rabin, supra note 1, at 231\u201332.[\/footnote] Even jurisdictions most receptive to claims of mental harm set an exacting threshold to qualify for compensation.[footnote]See, e.g., Lawson v. Mgmt. Activities, Inc., 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 745, 756 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding that airline operators have no duty \u201cto avoid the emotional trauma inherent in any crash to otherwise unhurt bystanders\u201d).[\/footnote] Take the bystander who witnessed a horrific accident in California, the first state to loosen the strictness on emotional distress.[footnote]See generally Dillon v.

[\/footnote] However grave or clearly manifested her panic or shock, she cannot recover unless she is \u201cclosely related\u201d to the victim, \u201cpresent at the scene of [her] injury,\u201d and fully \u201caware\u201d of its incidence in real-time.[footnote]Thing v. La Chusa, 771 P.2d 814, 829\u201330 (Cal. 1989) (en banc).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [\/footnote] These onerous constraints on claims to redress mental harm belittle the gravity of such injuries.[footnote]See Rabin, supra note 1, at 237 (arguing that \u201cemotional distress claims [accordingly sound] a cautionary note\u201d).[\/footnote] And reducing them to emotional distress fails, at any rate, to \u201cspeak to the enduringly disrupted life plans and transformed life experiences, especially when procreation is imposed or confounded.\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 171.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBy contrast, a right to recover for reproductive negligence marks out that conduct as morally wrong.[footnote]See id. at 212.[\/footnote] The Singapore Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hold the clinic liable rebutted any impression that its mix-up is an acceptable way of treating people who are trying to plan their family. The compensation was not for any out-of-pocket costs that the couple would incur in raising their baby.[footnote]See ACB v. Thomson Med. Pte Ltd. [2017] SGCA 20 (Sing.) at paras. 86\u2013101.[\/footnote] The court explicitly rejected compensation to provide material support for one\u2019s child.[footnote]Such compensation would \u201craise[] the spectre of a possible conflict of interest between the parents\u2019 private interests in the litigation and their duties vis-\u00e0-vis their children,\u201d the court concluded. Id. at para. 95. \u201c[T]o establish a case for the recovery of\u201d costs to house, clothe, feed, and care for their child, \u201cparents would have to come to court to prove that their child[] represent[s] a net loss to them. The very nature of such an exercise,\u201d by \u201cencourag[ing] the exaggeration of any infirmities and the diminution of benefits as might exist in their children,\u201d it explained, would \u201ctaint [the] essential character\u201d of parenthood\u2019s \u201clegal, moral, and social obligations to care for, support, and nurture\u201d one\u2019s child. Id. at paras. 87, 95, 99.[\/footnote] It benchmarked the award in terms of childrearing expenses merely for want of a less arbitrary point of reference to \u201creflect[] sufficiently the seriousness of the\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. loss and [a] just, equitable, and proportionate [response under] the circumstances of the case\u201d\u2014one that falls \u201csomewhere between these two extremes\u201d of full \u201cindemnity for the costs of raising [the] [b]aby\u201d and a \u201cnominal sum\u201d that would \u201cmake a mockery of the value of the interest at stake.\u201d[footnote]See id. at para. 150.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe precise total could not escape a measure of arbitrariness. But that award of \u201csubstantial damages\u201d signaled that such mix-ups are not acceptable ways to treat patients who have counted on specialists to help them plan their family. By holding the clinic liable for breaching its duty to care for the couple\u2019s reproductive interests, the court said that confounded procreation is serious enough to warrant public vindication.

This more tailored kind of interrogation, I argued, should \u201cinform judicial determinations about the circumstances under which a remedy for reproductive negligence may be void for public policy.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 231.[\/footnote] There are plausible reasons to value genetic or gestational ties, for example, without disfavoring adoptive, LGBT, or other families who flourish in the absence of biological kinship. Some prospective parents long to perceive a likeness in their baby\u2019s appearance; they may even believe that such resemblance would help strengthen emotional bonds.[footnote]This ideal of genetic kinship assumes pride of place in the history of United States adoption. That institution was designed to \u201cunite children with parents who looked like them\u201d to \u201cobscure the fact that they had been born to others.\u201d Ellen Herman, Kinship by Design: A History of Adoption in the Modern United States 123, 150 (2008). Adoption agencies and social workers sought above all to bring adoptive parents together with children who resembled them. \u201cEnduring beliefs in the power of blood, and widespread doubts about whether families could thrive without it, fueled ardent efforts to subject adoption to\u201d the social engineering of so-called \u201cnaturalization.\u201d Id. at 7. This matching paradigm reflects the persistent assumption that resemblance between parents and children \u201cexpedited love,\u201d while differences threatened a sense of shared identity, emotional bonding, and family belonging. Id. at 125.

Recovery need not express or reflect disrespect for individuals who defy traditional expectations about parenthood.\r\n\r\nRace sorting in family formation also remains a source of evolving conflict more than moral clarity or social consensus.[footnote]See Dov Fox, Race Sorting in Family Formation, 49 Fam.

As a lesbian growing up in a small conservative farm town, Jennifer Cramblett knew the sting of not fitting in. So when she and her long-term partner Amanda Zinkon decided to start a family, they looked for a donor who would at least resemble them. Her doctor recommended Midwest Sperm Bank, with its hundreds of potential donors and detailed profiles to pick from. They carefully selected donor No. 380, who was white like they are. Plus, he had blond hair and blue eyes like Zinkon. (They expected that Cramblett\u2019s traits would already be reflected in the child, since she would be carrying their baby-to-be.) After Cramblett got pregnant, the couple called the sperm bank to order additional samples from the same donor, so that their little girl could have a biological sibling. The receptionist on the phone confirmed: \u201cOkay, you want eight vials of sperm from Donor No. 330,\u201d to which Cramblett replied, \u201cNo, I said\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. No. 380.\u201d Id. at 4. The sperm bank, it turns out, handwrites its records by pen and paper. So whoever had set aside the sample for Cramblett must have mistaken an 8 for a 3. Realizing that the couple was apparently given the wrong sperm, the receptionist clarified whether she \u201chad requested an African American donor.\u201d \u201cWhy would I?\u201d Cramblett answered. \u201cMy partner and I are Caucasian.\u201d Id. at 3\u20136.[\/footnote] The mix-up subjected them to the first-hand experience of their community\u2019s indifference to racial exclusion and the stinging insults of an uncle who \u201cspeaks openly and derisively about persons of color.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 6.[\/footnote] The couple fears that they are woefully ill-equipped with the \u201ccultural competency\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] required to navigate the \u201cchallenges [of] transracial parenting.\u201d[footnote]Complaint at 5, Cramblett v.

See Complaint, supra note 108, at 5\u201311.[\/footnote] I am inclined to agree with the court that the harms these parents suffered find uncomfortable recourse under the law. But my reasons are different. Framed as a response to enduring racial prejudice and disadvantage, recovery could dignify those \u201cprivate biases\u201d to which, the Supreme Court has held in the custody context, \u201cthe law cannot, directly or indirectly, give\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. effect.\u201d[footnote]Palmore v.

This procreation right overreaches when it breathes life into the idea that it is worse for parents to have a child with darker skin or mixed ancestry. Affording relief for the consequent adversities of navigating public life risks sustaining monoracial family whiteness as a socially advantaged norm.[footnote]See Angela Onwuachi-Willig, According to Our Hearts: <em>Rhinelander v.

Id. at 131, 283.[\/footnote] This past cannot help but color what it means for courts to award damages for thwarted efforts to have a white child. That does not mean that policy concerns rule out any remedy at all in cases like Cramblett\u2019s. Courts could still authorize a cause of action that disapproves and disciplines any proven professional wrongdoing. Deterrent compensation could take statutory form in liquidated damages for negligently confounded procreation. This would be a modest, fixed amount for nothing more than the failure to provide competent services. That award would explicitly disclaim inquiry into the more particular nature of reproductive loss.\r\n<h2>III. Rethinking the Theory<\/h2>\r\nProfessor Keating argues that my proposal to remedy reproductive negligence betrays the storied history of tort law and lays bare its conceptual limits. Tort law redresses only \u201charms\u201d sustained to existing things of value that we already have, as future goods\u2014what Keating calls \u201cbenefits\u201d\u2014are not ours yet.[footnote]See Keating, supra note 1, at 218.[\/footnote] This \u201cpreoccupation\u201d with harms over benefits reflects the widely held view that the loss of existing goods is more serious and worthier of relief.[footnote]See id. at 221.[\/footnote] Yet it is unrealized benefits at stake when you get the baby you did not plan for, for example, or do not get the one you did. The tort system is accordingly \u201cinhospitable to the recognition of the reproductive wrongs.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 225.[\/footnote] Professor Keating\u2019s harm\u2013benefit distinction is like the difference between being infected with a disease and being refused the vaccine to prevent it. Infection harms you by impairing a health you had been enjoying, whereas refusing the vaccine imperils only your future health. That loss does not do any <em>harm<\/em>, in Keating\u2019s term; it denies a <em>benefit<\/em>. This threat to future rather than existing goods, however likely and grave, simply is not enough, he argues, to support a claim under existing tort law.[footnote]See id. at 219, 222.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nYet some torts do confer what Keating calls \u201cbenefits.\u201d They redress\u00ad the lost chance of achieving a more favorable outcome or lost \u201copportunity to obtain a better degree of recovery.\u201d[footnote]Lord v. Lovett, 770 A.2d 1103, 1104\u201306 (N.H. 2001). For discussion, see Claire Finkelstein, Is Risk a Harm?, 151 U. Pa. L. Rev. 963, 985\u201386 (2003); Nancy Levit, Ethereal Torts, 61 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 136, 154\u201358 (1992).[\/footnote] So, for example, when an obstetrician\u2019s botched surgery left a woman healthy for now, but at greater risk of bowel obstruction down the road, the court approved compensation for that 8\u201316% chance of future peril.[footnote]Petriello v. Kalman, 576 A.2d 474, 476\u201377, 484 (Conn. 1990).[\/footnote] It is not just doctors who must answer for mistakes that make patients more vulnerable to some physical ailment they do not yet have and might never develop.[footnote]See, e.g., Dickhoff v. Green, 836 N.W.2d 321, 325\u201326 (Minn. 2013).[\/footnote] Accountants can also be held liable under the tort of malpractice for bad investments that lose a client potential income.[footnote]See, e.g., Cast Art Indus. v. KPMG, 36 A.3d 1049, 1051\u201352 (N.J. 2012).[\/footnote] And drunk drivers can be forced to pay for the lost income a victim might otherwise have earned, even when that victim is a child who never had a job in the first place.[footnote]See, e.g., Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Sutton, 765 So. 2d 1269, 1276\u201377 (Miss. 2000).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nI will explain shortly why I think that such examples of future-oriented tort awards cannot simply be explained away as proxies for the impairment of existing wealth, health, or companionship, especially as they apply to reproductive negligence.[footnote]See infra notes 146\u2013152 and accompanying text (discussing tort damages for loss of filial consortium).[\/footnote] But for now let us accept Keating\u2019s contention that tort law responds only to harms, not lost benefits. He does recognize that harms and benefits are just \u201cpluses and minuses\u201d on either end of \u201cthe same scale.\u201d[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 222.[\/footnote] Yet tort distinguishes these concepts, in his view, because \u201c[h]arms and benefits stand in very different relations to autonomy.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 223. Keating indeed argues that the whole point of our tort system is to pro\u00admote the very autonomy that Sanger had advised my proposal eschew. See supra notes 23\u201326 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Harms \u201cto our bodies and to our possessions\u201d in particular \u201cimpair[] the principal means at our disposal for\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. exert[ing] our wills upon the world,\u201d[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 217, 223.[\/footnote] Keating argues, whereas the suppression of benefits rarely \u201crob[s] us of our normal and foundational powers of agency.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 223.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis seems too quick. It limits my ability to chart my life course no less just because the identity or project that I throw myself into happens to be a future benefit. Keating has a point that benefits I have not undertaken or enjoyed may not be \u201ccongruent with [my] will[]. To thrust an unsought benefit upon [me] and demand compensation\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. for the value conferred\u201d would conscript me in a project that I have not chosen.[footnote]Id. at 223.[\/footnote] Benefits I did not seek out\u2014the vaccine that I never consented to\u2014may thereby deprive me of the very autonomy that Keating says tort law is designed to preserve.\r\n\r\nThe benefits that reproductive negligence frustrates are not, in the first place, unsolicited. It is prospective parents who those procreation rights would protect, after all, not the potential children who could not have asked for any of this. Would-be parents seek out fertility or infertility treatment with the explicit goal of remaining childfree or becoming a caretaker. When a doctor bungles a tubal ligation or drops a tray of embryos, that error foists parenthood or childlessness on people who had made crystal clear their strong preference to the contrary. Reproductive negligence disorders their lives in profound ways that they experience as at least as foreign as any \u201cbroken bones, crippling pain, [or] significant disability.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 215. Keating relies in relevant part here on points developed in Seana Valentine Shiffrin, Harm and Its Moral Significance, 18 Legal Theory 357 (2012).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis leads me to think that Professor Keating draws the harm\u2013benefit asymmetry too sharply and makes too much of it. My quarrel is not just with his descriptive claim that tort law tends, as a general matter, to protect against the withdrawal of existing goods more than it does the withholding of future ones.[footnote]See supra notes 128\u2013130 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] I am also wary of his normative claim about why tort law could not at any rate admit exceptions.[footnote]See Keating, supra note 1, at 214\u201315.[\/footnote] To the extent that tort law privileges harms over benefits, more practical reasons make better sense than autonomy of why. Future benefits are harder to prove and calculate. That they have not happened yet clouds the picture of what might have been, or obscures the value of goods that never were. The uncertainty of that loss does not, however, mean that it can never be projected clearly or confidently enough to sustain redress. Damages should simply be discounted by the chances that some other factor was to blame for having caused that loss, such that procreation would have been imposed, deprived, or confounded just the same even in the absence of wrongdoing.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 189\u201391, 197\u2013200, 206\u201309.[\/footnote] This is just the probabilistic recovery afforded under the loss-of-chance doctrine.[footnote]See id. at 226\u201328.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother uncertainty concerns whether a projected loss will befall the victims, either at all or as severely as anticipated. But again, tort law has sound ways to address that problem. Say it cannot be known whether a child will ultimately develop the genetic disease that a mix-up or misdiagnosis left him susceptible to. Courts could fashion protective remedies like a judicially supervised guardianship or reversionary trust that disburses funds only as the repercussions of that mix-up or misdiagnosis are felt.[footnote]See id. at 208\u201309.[\/footnote] Anything that is left over if and when those consequences dissipate would be returned to the defendant.[footnote]See, e.g., Robak v. United States, 503 F. Supp. 982, 983 (N.D. Ill. 1980), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 658 F.2d 471 (7th Cir. 1981); Garrison v. Med. Ctr. of Del. Inc., 581 A.2d 288, 292 (Del. 1989); Kush v. Lloyd, 616 So. 2d 415, 422\u00ad\u201324 (Fla. 1992); Arche v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army, 798 P.2d 477, 486\u201387 (Kan. 1990).[\/footnote] Availability of such remedies leave little basis for tort law to deny recovery for the loss of a reasonably expected child-to-be when it readily compensates for the loss of an existing child, even moments after birth.[footnote]Cf. Michael B. Kelly, The Rightful Position in \u201cWrongful Life\u201d Actions, 42 Hastings L.J. 505, 558 (1991) (arguing that wrongful-birth torts protect expectation interests by focusing recovery on \u201cthe difference between the cost of raising a healthy child, which the parents expected and were willing to pay, and the cost of raising an impaired child, which the parents did not expect\u201d).[\/footnote] Of course, the newborn has already arrived to us in the here and now, while the yet-to-be born fetus or embryo may never have. But this uncertainty need not affect liability. Instead, courts should, at the damages stage, reduce awards based on the odds that \u201ca couple\u2019s age and other circum\u00adstances would have given them\u201d to achieve \u201cpregnancy and live birth\u201d had misconduct not reduced those chances they had.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 199.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is \u201ceasier to visualize what was at stake,\u201d Professor Steven Smith argues, when the sound of a baby\u2019s gentle cry or touch of her hand wrapping around one\u2019s finger \u201care actual memories and not just conceptual possibilities.\u201d[footnote]Steven D. Smith, Missing Persons, 2 Nev. L.J. 590, 603 (2002).[\/footnote] Whereas the newborn assumes an unmistakable place in her parents\u2019 world, it may \u201crequire an act of imagination to appreciate the value that could have been realized with a potential person who never actually came into living, breathing existence.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 597\u201398.[\/footnote] What parenthood will involve or mean is hazier when \u201cthere is no actual child\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. for the couple\u2019s reflections to distill around.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 602.[\/footnote] But when their expectation was well founded, the loss of that relationship-to-be is still real and serious.[footnote]See Jill Wieber Lens, Recognizing Invisible Death 9\u201310 (2018) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (noting that understandings of and reactions to stillbirth have evolved over time).[\/footnote] Refusal to recognize that harm underestimates tort\u2019s conceptual agility.\r\n\r\nCourts already measure damages for lost consortium and enjoyment of life as a function of losses that have not yet come to pass.[footnote]JoEllen Lind, Valuing Relationships: The Role of Damages for Loss of Society, 35 N.M. L. Rev. 301, 303 &amp; n.14 (2005).[\/footnote] Professor JoEllen Lind observes that these awards thereby \u201cexhibit the forward-looking, expectation attributes of contract law.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 305.[\/footnote] Lost wages look to future losses too. Consortium damages, for their part, \u201cfocus on the missed opportunity\u201d of human interaction that \u201cwould have flourished over time\u201d had misconduct not impaired that relationship.[footnote]Id. at 302, 305. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [\/footnote] This future-oriented feature of consortium damages makes sense of why some courts do not condition their award on a potential child\u2019s having been born. When a reckless driver took the life of a pregnant woman, the Iowa Supreme Court allowed her husband to recover consortium damages for the seven-and-a-half-month-old fetus as well.[footnote]Dunn v. Rose Way, Inc., 333 N.W.2d 830, 831, 834 (Iowa 1983).[\/footnote] That \u201closs certainly does not vanish because the deprivation occurred prior to birth,\u201d the court held.[footnote]Id. at 833.[\/footnote] \u201cTo the deprived parent the loss is real either way.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] The unborn need not be treated as persons with legal interests of their own for prospective parents to have \u201cdeveloped a relationship with them,\u201d as one Arizona court made clear in awarding consortium damages in a medical malpractice suit for loss of stillborn twins.[footnote]Burnham v. Miller, 972 P.2d 645, 647 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1998).[\/footnote] It was enough that it was reasonable for the parents to have \u201cdeveloped love for them and expectations for their future.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt strains the imagination to conjure the defeated benefits when imposed or confounded procreation leaves a person with the baby she did not have before and specifically sought to avoid. One need only think of the lost sleep, freedom, or time for other existing kids or projects outside the family that are central to her life enjoyment. Professor Keating argues that these future goods were mere benefits because she did not have them already, so they cannot be treated as autonomously hers. Acquiring the benefits may have \u201cenlarge[d] the reach\u201d of her will, but losing them does not impair it.[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 217.[\/footnote] This strikes me as a distinction without a difference. Why should it matter that she did not have those things so long as she had good reason to expect them and plan her life accordingly? Keating\u2019s answer sounds less in the legal outcome than its mechanics. He would not deny compensation for reproductive negligence. He would just look else\u00adwhere for authority. Tort law is <em>protective<\/em>, he might say, not <em>productive<\/em> like contract is. But when misconduct imposes, deprives, or confounds procreation, it does not really protect against the kind of bad outcomes that make people worse off; it just fails to produce good ones that would have improved their lot.\r\n\r\nTort is limited to \u201cinteractions in which one of the parties detri\u00admen\u00adtally changes the position of the other,\u201d is how Professor Ronen Perry puts it; contract applies when \u201cone of the parties promised something to the other and in so doing created an expectation that did not formerly exist.\u201d[footnote]Ronen Perry, It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, 93 Cornell L. Rev. 329, 383 (2008).[\/footnote] Keating echoes the sentiment that Perry expressed in a different context: \u201c[S]ince the Gordian knot of tort law cannot be untied, it must be cut altogether. We must replace the traditional tort framework, which gives rise to an insoluble problem, with a more promising contractual framework.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 398 (discussing wrongful-life suits).[\/footnote] Keating argues that contract better addresses the thwarted exercise of one person\u2019s will together with another\u2019s for their mutual \u201ccreation and protection of legitimate expectations of future benefit.\u201d[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 218.[\/footnote] Sanger, too, had noted the allure of contract law in describing the angst that \u201cdisappointed plaintiffs\u201d sustain when \u201cthey [don\u2019t] get what they bargained and paid for\u2014competent medical treatment\u2014toward a reproductive goal.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 38.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIndeed, U.S. courts have increasingly adopted a freedom-of-contract framework, for example, to adjudicate reproductive disputes between surrogates and the intended parents.[footnote]Deborah S. Mazer, Born Breach: The Challenge of Remedies in Surrogacy Contracts, 28 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 211, 218\u201319 (2017).[\/footnote] Contract enforcement is limited even in this context, however. A salient example comes from agreed-to terms about whether to selectively reduce a multiple-order pregnancy or terminate a single fetus diagnosed with an anomaly.[footnote]See, e.g., Dov Fox, Surrogacy Contracts, Abortion Conditions, and Parenting Licenses, Bill of Health (June 7, 2016), http:\/\/blogs.harvard.edu\/billofhealth\/2016\/06\/07\/surrogacy-contracts-abortion-conditions-and-parenting-licenses-in-the-curious-case-of-cook-v-harding\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/79VW-CX9M].[\/footnote] And besides, social and economic forces, I had noted, relieve most family-planning specialists of the usual market pressures to assure the results of their care.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 172\u201374.[\/footnote] So as a practical matter, there is rarely any \u201cbargained and paid for\u201d agreement to enforce against mishandled reproductive outcomes.[footnote]See id. at 173.[\/footnote] Most family-planning specialists even insist that patients sign clauses that shield reproductive specialists from liability for even implied breach.[footnote]A typical indemnification-and-liquidated-damages clause comes from the standard contract used by the country\u2019s leading sperm bank. California Cryobank requires anyone who wants to use one of its donors to start a family to sign this: \u201cClient agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Cryobank\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. against any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, offsets, causes of action and expenses\u201d resulting from \u201cany possible loss, degradation, spoilage, contamination or the like of any portion or all of the semen for any reason, including but without limitation, as a result of Cryobank\u2019s negligence.\u201d Cal. Cryobank, Donor Semen Services Agreement 3\u20134, http:\/\/cryobank.com\/uploadedFiles\/\r\nCryobankcom\/_forms\/pdf\/documents\/PurchaseStorageAgreement.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/J6JG-84TH]. Nor does Cryobank make any guarantees about the quality or viability of specimens.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMore fundamentally, however, contract misses tort law\u2019s emphasis on the distinctively abiding forms of obligation that family planners are owed by specialists ranging from obstetricians, pharmacists, and embry\u00adologists to fertility clinics, sperm banks, and surrogacy agencies. Each assumes practice-specific responsibilities that they cannot waive to the individuals they take on as patients or clients.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 215\u201316.[\/footnote] This commitment to their interests in pregnancy, parenthood, or particulars does more than either fill in contractual gaps in the name of justice or modify agreements for good faith or fair dealing.[footnote]See Perry, supra note 154, at 382.[\/footnote] Nondisclaimable duties of professional care are tort law\u2019s chief attraction in a context like reproductive medicine, in which people entrust professionals to carry out a cherished social practice with far-reaching life consequences.[footnote]See Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 170.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPerhaps this explains why Professor Keating ultimately gestures toward a compound approach to reproductive negligence that would be part tort, part contract:\r\n<blockquote>What we need is a hybrid legal regime that borrows from both tort and contract law. An adequate regime would take from tort law the principle that duties of care are binding and inalienable. It would take from contract law both a concern with fashioning the terms on which the assistance of others may be enlisted and a regime of remedies designed to address cases in which malfea\u00adsance results in the failure to realize a legitimate expectation of benefit.[footnote]Keating, supra note 1, at 227.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nI have no principled objection to grafting tort\u2019s duty of reproductive care onto contract law\u2019s enforcement of cooperative efforts between patients and providers. There is indeed precedent for this chimeric sort of action in the liability doctrine that governs product-borne injuries to persons or property.\r\n\r\nProducts liability started out in contract law.[footnote]See David G. Owen, The Evolution of Products Liability Law, 26 Rev. Litig. 955, 967\u201369 (2007).[\/footnote] Consumer transactions were governed exclusively by assurances made in the course of commercial marketing that the vended goods, for example, exhibited quality sufficient to make them fit for sale.[footnote]See Robert L. Rabin, Restating the Law: The Dilemmas of Products Liability, 30 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 197, 199\u2013200 (1997).[\/footnote] The twentieth century marked a transformation in products liability, however, toward tort actions like negligent misrepre\u00adsentation and strict liability for design defects.[footnote]Products liability was pushed beyond a negligence standard to strict liability by Justice Roger Traynor, first in concurrence, Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., 150 P.2d 436, 440\u00ad\u201341 (Cal. 1944) (Traynor, J., concurring), and later for a unanimous California Supreme Court, Greenman v. Yuba Power Prods., Inc., 377 P.2d 897, 901 (Cal. 1963).[\/footnote] Exemplifying this turn is the celebrated 1916 case about the driver who was injured when the wooden wheel on his Buick collapsed.[footnote]MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916).[\/footnote] The New York Court of Appeals held the manufacturer liable even though it had sold the automobile to the dealer without promising that it would work.[footnote]See id. at 1052\u201354.[\/footnote] The absence of contract elements was no barrier to recovery. Judge Benjamin Cardozo explained:\r\n<blockquote>We have put aside the notion that the duty to safeguard life and limb, when the consequences of negligence may be foreseen, grows out of contract and nothing else. We have put the source of the obligation where it ought to be. We have put its source in the law.[footnote]Id. at 1053.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\n\u201cThe law\u201d where he placed this duty is tort, justly celebrated for its moral imagination.[footnote]See, e.g., Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 37\u201338 (1881).[\/footnote] Tort is uniquely equipped to accommodate new forms of wrongfully inflicted harm that merit protection in the absence of explicit or implicit warranty. This common law was capacious enough to protect against injuries that could be traced to defective car parts on distant assembly lines. So too should it guard against forced pregnancy or robbed parenthood at the hands of family planning specialists.\r\n\r\nTo remedy reproductive negligence, tort law need not resign itself to freewheeling policy or sacrifice its conceptual integrity on the altar of justice. Keating divides the work of\u00ad tort and contract in terms of whether an injured party suffered the loss of an existing or future good, a harm or a benefit. I would draw the doctrinal boundaries differently. Tort law is for those injuries that society has determined it will not stand for, whether or not a more vulnerable party secured assurances against their infliction. Contract is for other injuries, those that we have not declared intolerable, but that parties have made agreements about on their own. By demoting contract law to this private-ordering role, I do not mean to suggest that it should be \u201creabsorbed into the mainstream of \u2018tort.\u2019\u201d[footnote]Grant Gilmore, The Death of Contract 95 (1974).[\/footnote] My point is only that tort can do without help from contract law in holding professionals to account for wrongfully imposing, depriving, or confounding procreation. And given the practical limits that beset contract enforcement, like the political challenges that stand in the way of public regulation, the clarion call of tort awards may for now be the best that we can do.\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\n\u201cPlanning procreation,\u201d Professor Sanger reminds us, \u201chas never been a surefire enterprise.\u201d[footnote]Sanger, supra note 1, at 38. Sanger speculates that \u201c[t]he focus on planning may reflect a generational difference.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [I]n the past there were fewer treatments for infertility and so the medical profession had little to offer,\u201d while today \u201cmore women are likely to have entered the zone of concern because they are actively seeking pregnancy later in their life span.\u201d Id. at 38\u201339. She \u201cwonder[s] as well if there is a millennial\u2014or more likely a Gen X\u2014expectation of control over other things as well, connected in part to a faith in technology and invention.\u201d Id. at 39.[\/footnote] But neither is riding a car or preparing a meal or all kinds of risky activities that our legal system has nothing to say about when food contamination or car accidents happen. And our laws still respond to those harms when a responsible party\u2014such as a meat producer or drunk driver\u2014is to blame for having caused them. Sanger is right that \u201closs of control\u201d can sometimes shade into \u201cacceptance\u201d of the reproductive fate that negligence victims are dealt.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Not always, or even often perhaps; but maybe, and certainly sometimes. She points to the striking portrait that emerges from author Andrew Solomon\u2019s <em>Far from the Tree<\/em>. His book tells the story of 300 families who \u201clearn to tolerate, accept and finally celebrate children who are not what they originally had in mind.\u201d[footnote]Andrew Solomon, Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity 5 (2012).[\/footnote] Solomon bears witness to how these parents of chil\u00addren\u2014with deafness or dwarfism, Down syndrome or schizophrenia, pro\u00addigious talents or transgender identity\u2014find themselves \u201cfalling in love with someone they didn\u2019t yet know enough to want.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 47.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe tenacity of parental love does not, however, diminish the legitimate interest in choosing offspring particulars, or the real losses to life plans or identities when that interest is wrongfully frustrated. Solomon also captures the episodic despair, isolation, and indignation of even the most resilient parents. And our law does not ordinarily condition legal relief for unjustly inflicted adversities on whether victims are able to abide or come to terms with them. Nor does it immunize wrongdoers from liability just because plaintiffs tough it out or find consolation in how things ended up. It makes no difference for remediation purposes that most \u201cparents with moderate coping skills\u201d do not \u201csuffer lasting grief or family dysfunction,\u201d for example, when flawed prenatal tests lead them to \u201chave a child with a disabling condition.\u201d[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 235.[\/footnote] It is enough to support a claim against the specialist at fault that the parents had \u201cwish[ed] to forgo the emotional, physical, and financial pressures of hospital visits, medical expenses, and special education that caring for a child with special needs can entail.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThat parents will value the relationship with a child whose features reproductive negligence rendered unanticipated or unfamiliar does not make that error harmless or that harm noncompensable. A longstanding tort doctrine was designed to remedy just this sort of injury by mitigating damages \u201c[w]here the defendant\u2019s [harmfully] tortious conduct\u201d has at the same time \u201cconferred upon the plaintiff a special benefit.\u201d[footnote]Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a0920 (1939).[\/footnote] This benefit-offset rule eschews all-or-nothing awards in favor of one that balances the harms that misconduct caused against any countervailing benefits that it brought along with it as well.[footnote]See Jones v. Malinowski, 473 A.2d 429, 436\u201337 (Md. 1984) (holding that the \u201cjury must assess the[] benefits\u201d of a slipshod sterilization \u201cin light of the circumstances of the particular case\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. taking into account\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. family size and income, age of the parents and other relevant factors\u201d to determine whether the negligently wrought reproductive outcome nevertheless benefits the parents).[\/footnote] Courts have criticized this approach for \u201ccomparing apples and oranges, that is, involving highly speculative and unquantifiable damages in contrast to intangible bene\u00adfits.\u201d[footnote]Smith v. Gore, 728 S.W.2d 738, 743 (Tenn. 1987).[\/footnote] They have a point. There is no precise way to work out and tally up harms and benefits in having the kind of child that you actually did instead of some counterfactual one you did not. The undeniable complexity of trying to tease apart or add up what parents experience as good or bad does not, however, warrant refusing compensation or deterrence outright.[footnote]Fox, Reproductive Negligence, supra note 2, at 218\u201319 (observing that courts approximate damages for woolly losses to life, liberty, and dignity in matters of fiduciary breach, privacy intrusion, and lack of informed consent).[\/footnote] Better to identify these tradeoffs with care than \u201cto permit the law to be blinded to the realities of the plaintiff\u2019s concrete situation for the sake of indef\u00adinite\u00a0abstractions.\u201d[footnote]<em>Smith<\/em>, 728 S.W.2d at 744.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFertility treatment is not just some consumer indulgence. The choices we make about family formation dramatically shape our lives and the meaning they have for us. Misrepresented donors, misimplanted embryos, and misdiagnosed fetuses may be first-world problems; but they are not frivolous nor trivial harms. And they cannot be chalked up to occasional and honest mistakes like the inevitable slip of the hand or reasonable lapse in judgment. Their causes more often lie instead in the unsanitized laboratories, uncalibrated equipment, and unreliable quality controls that a regulatory vacuum makes predictable. These are clear breaches of the professional duty of care that sperm banks, IVF clinics, and OB\/GYN doctors owe to those whose reproductive interests they agree to serve. They are wrongs in need of rights.",

Drug Issues 329, 333 (2002) (explaining that \u201cSIFs\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. offer a much larger array of health and social services for injectors administered by professionals\u201d).[\/footnote] SIF advocates argue that SIFs prevent HIV, provide harm-focused help, and offer better social and medical services to an at-risk population than SEPs currently do.[footnote]Ian Malkin, Establishing Supervised Injecting Facilities: A Responsible Way to Help Minimise Harm, 25 Melb.

The Ambiguous Legal Existence of SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h2>\r\nCurrently, there is no legislative or legal impediment to offering par\u00adticipants bathrooms for personal use, assuming that they are used for lawful personal activities. However, SEPs with safe bathrooms have taken on the implicit role of providing drug users with a space where they can inject drugs. States do not legally acknowledge the current existence of some types of SEPs with safe bathrooms. Thus, explicit lawful state authorizations for SEPs do not discuss or acknowledge the presence of safe bathrooms as a place where there is a risk of drug use.[footnote]See supra section I.C.1 (relaying the general format and requirements of SEPs as defined by state laws).[\/footnote] SEPs with safe bathrooms serve an important purpose and advance treatment and safety policies by targeting harder-to-reach populations, but they have an unfortunate and ambiguous legal existence. This Part highlights liabili\u00adties that SEPs with safe bathrooms could incur. Section II.A details the operations and protocols of safe bathrooms in SEPs that could create SEP liability. Section II.B discusses the laws and their consequent liabilities that could apply to SEPs with safe bathrooms. Section II.C discusses how this uncertainty and these liabilities further the division that is often found between criminal law and public health.\r\n<h3>A. Understanding SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h3>\r\nOftentimes, participants in SEPs use the clean needles they receive from the SEPs and inject in the SEPs\u2019 bathrooms.[footnote]See Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] When they were first established, SEPs implemented policies that deterred users from injecting in their bathrooms. Today, some of these policies remain. To deter injection in the bathrooms, some SEPs use blue lights to make it harder for a participant to find a vein.[footnote]See Alexis Crabtree et al., A Qualitative Study of the Perceived Effects of Blue Lights in Washrooms on People Who Use Injection Drugs, 10 Harm Reduction J. 1, 7 (2013) (finding that blue lights in bathrooms do not deter drug users from engaging in public injection).[\/footnote] Other organizations prevent participants from using the bathroom for twenty-four hours after having received syringes.[footnote]Bathroom Etiquette: Injecting at the Exchange Part 1, Harm Reduction Coal.

Washington Heights CORNER Project and VOCAL-NY, two of New York\u2019s SEPs, are at the forefront of this trend: Although their official policy is that participants cannot use these bathrooms for drug use, they allow and provide accommodations that are conducive to safe bathroom drug injec\u00adtion.[footnote]Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] The CORNER Project has a handwritten \u201crules of the bathroom\u201d sign, as well as a \u201cmetal medical table, two hazardous material disposal boxes, and good vein maintenance posters\u201d in its safe bathrooms.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] It also has a \u201cdigital clock and [a] wall-mounted speaker next to the open, single toilet.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Additionally, there is always \u201csomeone checking in on an intercom every three minutes to make sure the user is still conscious.\u201d[footnote]Sanjay Gupta, Opioid Addiction and the Most Controversial Bathroom in New York, CNN (Oct. 26, 2017), http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/25\/health\/opioid-addiction-bathroom-safe-injection-site\/index.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/466J-6PBA].[\/footnote] VOCAL-NY is similar to the Washington Heights CORNER Project in that it offers the same safe bathroom amenities for the same concerns. The transparency of both VOCAL-NY and the CORNER Project stand in stark contrast to those SEPs that are less open about their bathroom policies and only admit to placing \u201csharps container[s]\u201d in their bathrooms.[footnote]Knefel, supra note 24. There are other SEPs that are similar to the Washington Heights CORNER Project and VOCAL-NY in that they \u201cadapted from an existing single use bathroom with modifications made to allow for a private space suitable for injection.\u201d Harm Reduction Coal., Alternatives to Public Injecting 15 (2016), http:\/\/www.harmreduction.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Alternatives-to-Public-Injection-report.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/TL2P-QGV6].[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOther SEPs do take a similar approach, but because of the taboo nature of the topic, they refuse to expressly acknowledge that they make safe-injection accommodations to their bathrooms. SEP organizations are sensitive about discussing their bathroom policies outside of the harm reduction community.[footnote]See Bathroom Etiquette, supra note 128.[\/footnote] In a podcast interview, three staff members of three different SEP organizations changed their names to preserve anonymity of both their programs and their policies.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Some SEPs explain that they do not expressly condone drug use on their premises.[footnote]See IDUHA Public Injection &amp; Onsite Bathroom Position Statement, Injection Drug Users Health All.

Liabilities Potentially Incurred by SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h3>\r\nSEPs accommodating for drug injection in their bathrooms create legal ambiguities. The laws that provide SEP legality and support across the country do not address drug injection within the premises. Addition\u00adally, these SEPs with safe bathrooms are not SIFs, as these SEPs do not directly monitor a participant\u2019s injection or high.[footnote]See Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] The SEPs with safe bathrooms do not expressly advertise their premises as a place where participants can openly inject.[footnote]See id. (\u201cThe issue is so sensitive that no other organizations or people\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. were willing to talk about their current or past bathroom policies on the record.\u201d).[\/footnote] Yet, they occupy an interesting space in the United States, where they are providing services that save lives through the prevention of fatal overdoses. Although SEPs are currently not able to expressly monitor or indicate they allow drugs on the prem\u00adises, they do monitor the bathroom itself for instances of overdose.[footnote]E.g., id. (\u201c[A]n employee at the front desk can communicate with [a drug user] through the speaker next to the toilet. If there\u2019s no response from the bathroom, the staff will physically check on the person\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] Without a legal framework, SEPs that provide safe bathrooms are in jeopardy, may be deterred by uncertainty, and are subject to many possible legal challenges. This section explores these legal challenges, concluding that SEPs seeking to make their bathrooms safe for injection must develop strategies to defend their practices under current law.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Section 856(a). <\/em>\u2014 Section 856 of the Controlled Substances Act provides that it is unlawful to:\r\n<blockquote>(1) knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of manu\u00adfacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance;\r\n\r\n(2) manage or control any place, whether permanently or temporarily, either as an owner, lessee, agent, employee, occu\u00adpant, or mortgagee, and knowingly and intentionally rent, lease, profit from, or make available for use, with or without compen\u00adsation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully manufac\u00adturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1)\u2013(2) (2012).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nSEPs with safe bathrooms could potentially violate either prong of the federal statute.

To convict a SEP with safe bathrooms under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1), a court would have to find that the SEP (1) knowingly (2) maintained the SEP (3) for the purpose of using a controlled substance. Id. \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1). To convict it under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2), a court would have to find that the SEP (1) managed or controlled the SEP (2) as either an owner, lessee, agent, employee, or mortgagee and (3) knowingly and intentionally rented, leased, or made available for use the place for the purpose of unlawfully storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance. Id. \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2).[\/footnote] In the United States, under the implement\u00ading regulations of the Controlled Substances Act, heroin is a controlled substance and is illegal to possess without a DEA license.[footnote]21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a01308.11 (2017).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo satisfy \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1), generally, the prosecution would need to argue that the SEP is maintained \u201cfor the specific purpose\u201d that drugs be used there.[footnote]See United States v. Wilson, 503 F.3d 195, 198 (2d Cir. 2007) (indicating that the phrase \u201cfor the purpose\u201d in \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1) \u201capplies to the intent of the person with an interest in the premises\u201d); United States v. Chen, 913 F.2d 183, 189\u201390 (5th Cir. 1990) (agreeing with the defendant\u2019s argument that she \u201ccould not be convicted under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1) unless she \u2018maintained\u2019 her motel for the specific purpose that drugs be distributed there\u201d). The \u201cpurpose\u201d requirement in \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1) \u201capplies to the person who knowingly opens or maintains a place\u201d and does not relate \u201cto what activity takes place there, caused by others.\u201d Id.[\/footnote] Prosecutors could point to several factors supporting the claim that SEPs with safe bathrooms purposely provide their space for others to use for drug injection.[footnote]See United States v. Verners, 53 F.3d 291, 297 (10th Cir. 1995) (noting that although the defendant \u201cwas apparently not sleeping at the house, it appears that one of his primary purposes in maintaining his place in the home was as a base of operations to run a drug manufacturing and distributing business\u201d); United States v. Banks, 987 F.2d 463, 467 (7th Cir. 1993) (noting that \u201cplaying a managerial or supervisory role in the\u201d distribution, manufacture, or use of drugs satisfies the purpose requirement under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1)).[\/footnote] SEPs with safe bathrooms are often equipped with hazardous waste disposal bins specifically designed for used needles, metallic tables that allow better angles for injection, and posters on the walls that give guidance on how to properly find veins.[footnote]See supra notes 131\u2013134 and accompanying text (pointing to a SEP with safe bathrooms\u2019 placement of sharps containers, warning signs, intercoms, knocking policies, and other amenities that exist to prevent overdosing).[\/footnote] The prosecution would argue that this is essentially providing an environment to help and possibly even encourage the usage of drugs in these bathrooms. Further, the frequency with which clients overdose, the number of needles discarded in the hazardous waste bins, and the general interaction with clients afterward would all support a finding of purpose. By implicitly or explicitly allowing their participants to use the bathrooms for injection, a SEP is purposely accepting drug use on their premises.\r\n\r\nSection 856(a)(2) prohibits an entity with a premises \u201cfrom knowingly and intentionally allowing its use for the purpose\u201d[footnote]<em>Wilson<\/em>, 503 F.3d at 197.[\/footnote] of \u201cunlawfully manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2) (2012).[\/footnote] Therefore, \u201cpurpose\u201d refers to the purpose \u201c<em>not<\/em> of the [entity] with the premises, but rather of those who are permitted to engage in drug-related activities there.\u201d[footnote]<em>Wilson<\/em>, 503 F.3d at 197; see also United States v.

Harrison, 133 F.3d 1084, 1086 (8th Cir. 1998).[\/footnote] Proving that a SEP had knowledge of drug use in its bathrooms under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2) would require similar factual support as proving purpose under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1).[footnote]See supra text accompanying notes 158\u2013161.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n2.<em> Drug-Possession Laws.<\/em> \u2014 Most states have laws that criminalize the possession of a controlled substance.[footnote]See, e.g., 720 Ill.

Penal Law \u00a7\u00a0220.03.[\/footnote] The exceptions usually come from the governing public health law.[footnote]See, e.g., id.[\/footnote] However, these laws do not exempt SEPs with safe bathrooms since SEPs were never intended to provide a space for drug use.[footnote]See supra section II.A.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf police find participants using drugs in SEPs with safe bathrooms, the SEP could be held accountable through either actual possession or constructive possession. Constructive possession would be the stronger case. Constructive possession exists when circumstantial evidence shows that an individual who is not actually the possessor has dominion and control over the contraband.[footnote]See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a0220.25. See generally John F. Harvey, Topic Survey, Criminal Law\u2014Establishing Minimum Evidentiary Requirements for Constructive Possession of Narcotics\u2014<em>United States v. Zavala Maldonado<\/em>, 23 F.3d 4 (1st Cir. 1994), 29 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 921 (1995) (defining constructive possession and highlighting the different interpre\u00adtations of constructive possession used by different circuit courts).[\/footnote] A prosecutor could argue that SEPs with safe bathrooms have dominion and control over those bathrooms and thus have dominion and control over the heroin being used inside them.[footnote]Cf. Considerations for Criminal Justice, supra note 45, at 5\u20137 (noting that SEP staff could face possession charges for drug equipment or even drugs themselves).[\/footnote] For example, in <em>People v. Manini<\/em>, the New York Court of Appeals held that when an entity or person exercises a level of control over the area in which property is found, or over the person from whom the property is seized (sufficient to give him or her the ability to use or dis\u00adpose of the property), the entity or person has constructive possession.[footnote]594 N.E.2d 563, 569 (N.Y. 1992).[\/footnote] Similarly, in Illinois, the defendant in <em>People v. Scott<\/em> was found guilty of constructive possession.[footnote]505 N.E.2d 42, 44 (Ill. App. Ct. 1987).[\/footnote] Even though he did not consume drugs him\u00adself, Mr. Scott was aware that his cohabitant, whose overdose prompted police investigation, was using.[footnote]Id. at 45.[\/footnote] Further, although he \u201cclaim[ed] he argued with her over her use of illegal drugs,\u201d \u201c[n]eedles used for administering drugs were found lying under a table next to the sofa bed where defendant slept.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Additionally, that \u201che could or should have been aware of their presence and existence\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

In some states, constructive possession is interpreted as \u201cknowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u201d Commonwealth v. Brzezinski, 540 N.E.2d 1325, 1331 (Mass. 1989).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Scott<\/em> bears a striking resemblance to what a case against a SEP with a safe bathroom would look like. Like Mr. Scott, a SEP would have to argue that it had no control or dominion over the person using the drug or the area in which the drug is present or where the drug use is occurring. A prosecutor could counter that a SEP does indeed have control over the participant given that the participant is only allowed into the bathroom with the SEP\u2019s permission.[footnote]See supra section II.A.[\/footnote] Although the SEP could claim that it was not aware of the drug use on its premises, this is a weak argument for many SEPs since some place disposal containers and posters delineating the safest way to inject.[footnote]See supra notes 159\u2013160 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] As previously stated, this sort of evidence would demonstrate knowledge or even purpose.[footnote]See supra notes 159\u2013166 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Despite this, there are still argu\u00adments that a SEP can make in its defense. Instead of focusing on any control it might have over the bathroom area, a SEP could focus its arguments on its overall lack of dominion over the drug users or the substances themselves more directly.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, officials can exercise prosecutorial discretion to not bring charges against SEPs.[footnote]See supra section I.C.4.[\/footnote] However, prosecutorial discretion is largely dependent on the political climate surrounding the agency or organiza\u00adtion itself.[footnote]See Considerations for Criminal Justice, supra note 45, at 1\u20132 (discussing com\u00adpeting policy objectives faced by police executives).[\/footnote] Regardless, this section demonstrates that there are grounds for liability for SEPs with safe bathrooms, especially when a statute or exemption is not found.[footnote]See supra section I.C.1 (showing how syringe exchange laws do not exempt SEPs from legal liability that would allow them to have safe bathrooms).[\/footnote] Defenses by SEPs arguing that they do not expressly allow drug use are unlikely to be successful given their control over the bathroom areas; after all, SEPs could potentially stop partici\u00adpants from using drugs by putting in blue lights or restricting access to the bathroom itself.[footnote]See IDUHA Statement, supra note 137.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>C.

Paving the Way for the Legal Acceptance of SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h2>\r\nUntil SIFs are enacted or supported, SEPs with safe bathrooms provide an important service to not only their participants but also the surrounding community. SEPs with safe bathrooms propagate harm reduction ideology.[footnote]See supra section II.A (explaining the goals of harm reduction that justify SEPs providing syringes to drug users).[\/footnote] On a smaller scale, SEPs work to prevent \u201cfatal overdose incidents involving heroin and other opioid drugs.\u201d[footnote]See Burris et al., supra note 32, at 1097 (\u201cInjection drug use\u2014and particularly injection in public\u2014threatens the community well-being in the form of discarded needles and the intoxicated behavior of those who inject publicly.\u201d (footnote omitted)).[\/footnote] Public injection threatens community well-being because drug users will either use drugs on the streets and expose individuals to illegal behavior or leave behind used syringes that endanger bystanders.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Although over\u00addoses do occur, SEP personnel in SEPs with safe bathrooms prevent participant death.[footnote]See Gupta, supra note 133 (noting that personnel are on hand to reverse overdoses); Knefel, supra note 24 (same); see also Bathroom Etiquette, supra note 128 (identifying measures taken to prevent death from overdose).[\/footnote] As previously stated, the Washington Heights CORNER Project announced that many participants use their bathrooms for drug injection.[footnote]Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] Allowing SEPs with safe bathrooms to exist also pre\u00advents drug injection in restaurant and other public restrooms.

Section III.A discusses a possible interpretation of SEP and related laws to accommodate safe bathrooms. Section III.B highlights the purpose of \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2) in reconciling it with SEPs that have safe bathrooms. Section III.C examines the potential use of state-of-emergency declarations to protect SEPs with safe bathrooms. Section III.D argues that a SEP with safe bathrooms can aptly excuse its practices with the necessity defense.\r\n<h3>A. State SEP and Related Laws Already Implicitly Authorize SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h3>\r\nAlthough it might seem as though syringe exchange laws are limited to the hypodermic needle itself, these laws can be interpreted to necessi\u00adtate that SEPs have safe bathrooms to meet the requirements in authori\u00adzation statutes.[footnote]N.Y.

Code R. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07.4.6.8, 7.4.6.10 (LexisNexis 2009).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many states have recently enacted some legal protec\u00adtions for individuals who assist in reversing overdoses.[footnote]See Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a0147A.18 (2017); Nev.

When the introduction of SEPs was first being considered, elected officials and their legal counsel acted \u201con reasonable interpreta\u00adtions of unsettled law.\u201d[footnote]Burris, Finucane, Gallagher &amp; Grace, supra note 8, at 1164.[\/footnote] Although lacking a clear legal basis, SEPs have often operated under color of law supported by such reasonable interpretations and \u201cnegotiation[s]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. between exchangers and law enforce\u00adment.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1165.[\/footnote] Consequently, advocates of SEPs with safe bathrooms can argue that it is reasonable to equip bathrooms with items that pro\u00admote safe injection. Participants will use bathroom spaces whether it is encouraged or deterred.[footnote]See Crabtree et al., supra note 127, at 7 (\u201c[I]nstalling blue lights is unlikely to deter injection drugs use in public washrooms, and may increase drug use-related harms.\u201d).[\/footnote] As previously stated, drug users often seek public bathrooms in which to inject without the owner\u2019s permission.[footnote]Bebinger, Ground Zero, supra note 140; cf. Atalanta, A Medical Student Becomes a Diabetic and Finds Public Disapproval, KevinMD (Oct. 31, 2011), http:\/\/\r\nwww.kevinmd.com\/blog\/2011\/10\/medical-student-diabetic-finds-public-disapproval.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/KC8Y-899Y] (finding disapproval for injecting insulin in public as a diabetic).[\/footnote] SEPs that have actively tried to deter drug injection in their bathrooms have ultimately failed to prevent it.[footnote]See supra notes 127\u2013129 and accompanying text (noting mechanisms imple\u00admented to deter drug use in public bathrooms).[\/footnote] Additionally, at least one study indi\u00adcates that using blue lights to deter drug injection is not effective.[footnote]See Crabtree et al., supra note 127, at 4 (\u201cEven among those who said they would try to avoid blue-lit bathrooms, almost half\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. described strategies they would use to overcome some of the inconvenience imposed by blue lights.\u201d).[\/footnote] The study found that even though drug users do not like blue lights since it \u201cmake[s] it more difficult for them to find their veins,\u201d about half of them \u201cwould not be deterred from injecting in\u201d blue-light bathrooms if they had no alternative.[footnote]Id. at 2, 4\u20135.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSince blue lights are not an absolute deterrence, installing them in a SEP may promote unsafe practices.[footnote]See id. at 2 (\u201cTheoretically, blue lights could compound the risk of injecting in public washrooms by increasing the probability that people who use injection drugs will miss the target vein and inject into surrounding tissue and by promoting other unsafe practices such as deep vein injecting\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] Other deterring practices would have similar results and effects.[footnote]See supra notes 127\u2013129 and accompanying text (describing the different ways SEPs have tried to deter bathroom injections in the past).[\/footnote] Thus, equipping bathrooms with items that promote safe injection would also serve to ensure staff safety, and it could be interpreted to fall under comprehensive harm reduction ser\u00advices, which some syringe exchange laws require.[footnote]See supra section I.C.1 (detailing the laws in place that mandate that plans include certain requirements under syringe exchange laws).[\/footnote] Additionally, placing sharps containers in SEP bathrooms would help SEP staff to collect used syringes, something syringe exchange laws also require.[footnote]See supra note 209 and accompanying text (describing New York SEP policies for distributing and collecting syringes and referring to other syringe exchange laws).[\/footnote] Since SEPs partially provide the community with syringes, they arguably also have a duty to provide a reliable mechanism for retrieving those needles back. It is reasonable to assume that SEPs can safeguard their bathrooms to conform to syringe exchange program requirements.[footnote]The New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute sets out some safety recommendations for SEPs with bathrooms, which suggest that allowing drug injection in SEPs to occur is a reasonable step as part of complying with syringe exchange laws. See N.Y. State Policies and Procedures, supra note 207, at 10\u201311 (making recommendations such as installing clearly marked naloxone kits, training staff as overdose responders, maintaining hygiene \u201cto avoid injection site infections,\u201d and having an intercom system to facilitate communication between staff and participants using the bathroom).[\/footnote] Notably, this solution is only valid in states that have authorization statutes.[footnote]See supra section I.B.1 (delineating SEP authorization through statutory, judicial, and executive means).[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B. SEPs with Safe Bathrooms Do Not Fall Under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)<\/h3>\r\nAs previously discussed, SEPs with safe bathrooms may also be liable under 21 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a0856.[footnote]See supra section II.B.1 (detailing the potential liability SEPs with safe bathrooms may face under either prong of the federal statute).[\/footnote] However, SEPs with safe bathrooms can argue that they do not satisfy the purpose requirement for either \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1) or \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2).[footnote]See supra section II.B.1.[\/footnote] Additionally, most of the cases tried under \u00a7\u00a0856(a) involve for-profit entities and not health or rehabilitation institutes. Although the trend is not determinative, it does mean courts will have to grapple with the idea of applying \u00a7\u00a0856(a) to health-related entities whose purpose is to rehabilitate and save lives.\r\n\r\nIn general, most cases under \u00a7\u00a0856(a) have involved places that have either profited from drug activities or have involved some form of manufacture and distribution of drugs.[footnote]Reducing Americans\u2019 Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act of 2002: Hearing on H.R. 5519 Before the Subcomm. on Crime, Terrorism &amp; Homeland Sec. of the H.

See N.Y. State Policies and Procedures, supra note 207, at 10 (discussing how state recommendations acknowledge that procedures may exist for certain aspects of SEPs that intersect with informal implementation of safer bathrooms in SEPs).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSEPs with safe bathrooms should also not be held liable under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2) because they are decidedly different from the entities that have been prosecuted. Defendants normally held liable under 856(a)(2) have either had an interest solely in drug activity itself or been engaged in activities on the premises that go beyond merely safeguarding against overdoses.[footnote]See supra notes 231\u2013235 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] SEPs should not fall within the realm of 856(a)(2) defend\u00adants because their only purpose of having overdose accommodations is to save lives. In <em>United States v. Tebeau<\/em>, the defendant safeguarded against overdose but also instructed security personnel \u201cto move sellers away from the front gates to avoid detection by [law enforcement] officers\u201d and gave them a list of drugs that \u201cwere permissible at the camp.\u201d[footnote]713 F.3d 955, 958 (8th Cir. 2013).[\/footnote] In <em>United States v.

App\u2019x 173, 181 (3d Cir. 2014).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nConsequently, applying \u00a7\u00a0856(a) to SEPs would defeat the purpose of the statute. First, SEPs with safe bathrooms support congressional intent. Passed as part of comprehensive drug legislation, \u00a7\u00a0856 was created \u201c[t]o strengthen Federal efforts to encourage foreign coopera\u00adtion in eradicating illicit drug crops,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to provide strong Federal leadership in establishing effective drug abuse prevention and education programs, [and] to expand Federal support for drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation efforts, and for other purposes.\u201d[footnote]132 Cong.

SEPs with Safe Bathrooms Act out of Necessity<\/h3>\r\nUnder the \u201cnecessity\u201d defense, an entity may legally act in an otherwise criminal manner in order to avoid greater harm in emergency situations.[footnote]Although courts sometimes treat justification and necessity as interchangeable, they are not the same. See Edward B. Arnolds &amp; Norman F. Garland, The Defense of Necessity in Criminal Law: The Right to Choose the Lesser Evil, 65 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 289, 289 (1975). A justification is not necessity because it is not an excuse. Id. Justification \u201cmakes harmful conduct proper and noncriminal\u201d while excuse \u201cexcuses the actor from criminal liability even though the actor was technically not justified in what he did.\u201d Id. at 289\u201390. For a discussion on destroying property and the necessity defense, see generally George C. Christie, The Defense of Necessity Considered from the Legal and Moral Points of View, 48 Duke L.J. 975, 981 (1999).[\/footnote] This defense is found in most states and is mostly accepted.[footnote]See Laura J. Schulkind, Note, Applying the Necessity Defense to Civil Disobedience Cases, 64 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 79, 82 n.17 (1989) (\u201cVirtually all jurisdictions have rejected the traditional requirement that the emergency arise out of a physical force of nature, such as flood or fire.\u201d).[\/footnote] Generally, the elements are that (1) the defendant acted to avoid a significant risk of harm, (2) no adequate lawful means could have been used to escape the harm, and (3) the harm avoided was greater than that caused by breaking the law.[footnote]See id. at 82 (\u201cThe common elements of the necessity defense\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. include the following: (1) the actor has acted to avoid a significant evil; (2) there are no adequate legal means to escape the harm; and (3) the remedy is not disproportionate to the evil sought to be avoided.\u201d).[\/footnote] The necessity defense was developed through the common law[footnote]See Arnolds &amp; Garland, supra note 263, at 291 (explaining the history and elements of the necessity defense).[\/footnote] and has been used to justify illegal actions to prevent the spread of fire, disease, and death.[footnote]See Seavey v. Preble, 64 Me. 120, 123 (1874) (using necessity to shield a doctor from liability when he damaged property in the course of preventing the spread of smallpox). Note that the necessity defense cannot be used to \u201cexcuse criminal activity intended to express the protestor\u2019s disagreement with positions reached by the lawmaking branches of the government.\u201d United States v. Dorrell, 758 F.2d 427, 432 (9th Cir. 1985).[\/footnote] The rationale behind this defense is that a person should not be punished if \u201chis act of breaking the law prevents more evil than it causes.\u201d[footnote]See Arnolds &amp; Garland, supra note 263, at 290 (\u201cThe rationale behind the excuse defenses was stated by Mr. Justice Holmes: \u2018Detached reflection cannot be expected in the presence of an uplifted knife.\u2019\u201d (quoting Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 343 (1921))).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOriginally, SEPs used this argument to justify having hypodermic needles because they were \u201cnecessary to avert a greater harm\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

For example, New York and New Jersey accepted the defense while Massachusetts did not consider it.[footnote]Considerations for Criminal Justice, supra note 45, at 6.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>People v. Bordowitz<\/em> was one of the first cases in which necessity was used as a defense against being charged for knowingly possessing hypodermic instruments.[footnote]588 N.Y.S.2d 507 (Crim. Ct. 1991).[\/footnote] The court explained that possession of hypodermic needles, while illegal under the statute, was justified because preventing the sharing of used needles could avert the greater harm of spread of HIV.[footnote]See id. at 512 (\u201cThe distinction, in broadest terms, during this age of the AIDS crisis is death by using dirty needles versus drug addiction by using clean needles. The defendants\u2019 actions sought to avoid the greater harm.\u201d).[\/footnote] The court reasoned that there were no \u201cmeaningful available options\u201d because \u201cevidence revealed [that] insufficient drug programs exist[ed] for the number of addicts in New York.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 511.[\/footnote] The defendants\u2019 acts of possession were reasonable since they were \u201cnecessary as an emergency measure to avert an imminent public injury.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEven if SEPs with safe bathrooms have intentionally and knowingly violated possession laws or the crack-house statute, defendants could argue that they \u201cnevertheless\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. have committed no crime.\u201d[footnote]See Arnolds &amp; Garland, supra note 263, at 289 (explaining the rationale of using the defense of necessity).[\/footnote] The result of applying this defense in the different states would likely be mixed, but much more favorable to SEPs with safe bathrooms than it was in the past since there is the benefit of SEP case precedent. Since SEPs have proven to be helpful, SEPs with safe bathrooms would have a basis to be looked at as helpful too.

The Ambiguous Legal Existence of SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h2>\r\nCurrently, there is no legislative or legal impediment to offering par\u00adticipants bathrooms for personal use, assuming that they are used for lawful personal activities. However, SEPs with safe bathrooms have taken on the implicit role of providing drug users with a space where they can inject drugs. States do not legally acknowledge the current existence of some types of SEPs with safe bathrooms. Thus, explicit lawful state authorizations for SEPs do not discuss or acknowledge the presence of safe bathrooms as a place where there is a risk of drug use.[footnote]See supra section I.C.1 (relaying the general format and requirements of SEPs as defined by state laws).[\/footnote] SEPs with safe bathrooms serve an important purpose and advance treatment and safety policies by targeting harder-to-reach populations, but they have an unfortunate and ambiguous legal existence. This Part highlights liabili\u00adties that SEPs with safe bathrooms could incur. Section II.A details the operations and protocols of safe bathrooms in SEPs that could create SEP liability. Section II.B discusses the laws and their consequent liabilities that could apply to SEPs with safe bathrooms. Section II.C discusses how this uncertainty and these liabilities further the division that is often found between criminal law and public health.\r\n<h3>A. Understanding SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h3>\r\nOftentimes, participants in SEPs use the clean needles they receive from the SEPs and inject in the SEPs\u2019 bathrooms.[footnote]See Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] When they were first established, SEPs implemented policies that deterred users from injecting in their bathrooms. Today, some of these policies remain. To deter injection in the bathrooms, some SEPs use blue lights to make it harder for a participant to find a vein.[footnote]See Alexis Crabtree et al., A Qualitative Study of the Perceived Effects of Blue Lights in Washrooms on People Who Use Injection Drugs, 10 Harm Reduction J. 1, 7 (2013) (finding that blue lights in bathrooms do not deter drug users from engaging in public injection).[\/footnote] Other organizations prevent participants from using the bathroom for twenty-four hours after having received syringes.[footnote]Bathroom Etiquette: Injecting at the Exchange Part 1, Harm Reduction Coal.

Washington Heights CORNER Project and VOCAL-NY, two of New York\u2019s SEPs, are at the forefront of this trend: Although their official policy is that participants cannot use these bathrooms for drug use, they allow and provide accommodations that are conducive to safe bathroom drug injec\u00adtion.[footnote]Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] The CORNER Project has a handwritten \u201crules of the bathroom\u201d sign, as well as a \u201cmetal medical table, two hazardous material disposal boxes, and good vein maintenance posters\u201d in its safe bathrooms.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] It also has a \u201cdigital clock and [a] wall-mounted speaker next to the open, single toilet.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Additionally, there is always \u201csomeone checking in on an intercom every three minutes to make sure the user is still conscious.\u201d[footnote]Sanjay Gupta, Opioid Addiction and the Most Controversial Bathroom in New York, CNN (Oct. 26, 2017), http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/10\/25\/health\/opioid-addiction-bathroom-safe-injection-site\/index.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/466J-6PBA].[\/footnote] VOCAL-NY is similar to the Washington Heights CORNER Project in that it offers the same safe bathroom amenities for the same concerns. The transparency of both VOCAL-NY and the CORNER Project stand in stark contrast to those SEPs that are less open about their bathroom policies and only admit to placing \u201csharps container[s]\u201d in their bathrooms.[footnote]Knefel, supra note 24.

SEP organizations are sensitive about discussing their bathroom policies outside of the harm reduction community.[footnote]See Bathroom Etiquette, supra note 128.[\/footnote] In a podcast interview, three staff members of three different SEP organizations changed their names to preserve anonymity of both their programs and their policies.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Some SEPs explain that they do not expressly condone drug use on their premises.[footnote]See IDUHA Public Injection &amp; Onsite Bathroom Position Statement, Injection Drug Users Health All.

Liabilities Potentially Incurred by SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h3>\r\nSEPs accommodating for drug injection in their bathrooms create legal ambiguities. The laws that provide SEP legality and support across the country do not address drug injection within the premises. Addition\u00adally, these SEPs with safe bathrooms are not SIFs, as these SEPs do not directly monitor a participant\u2019s injection or high.[footnote]See Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] The SEPs with safe bathrooms do not expressly advertise their premises as a place where participants can openly inject.[footnote]See id. (\u201cThe issue is so sensitive that no other organizations or people\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. were willing to talk about their current or past bathroom policies on the record.\u201d).[\/footnote] Yet, they occupy an interesting space in the United States, where they are providing services that save lives through the prevention of fatal overdoses. Although SEPs are currently not able to expressly monitor or indicate they allow drugs on the prem\u00adises, they do monitor the bathroom itself for instances of overdose.[footnote]E.g., id. (\u201c[A]n employee at the front desk can communicate with [a drug user] through the speaker next to the toilet. If there\u2019s no response from the bathroom, the staff will physically check on the person\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] Without a legal framework, SEPs that provide safe bathrooms are in jeopardy, may be deterred by uncertainty, and are subject to many possible legal challenges. This section explores these legal challenges, concluding that SEPs seeking to make their bathrooms safe for injection must develop strategies to defend their practices under current law.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Section 856(a). <\/em>\u2014 Section 856 of the Controlled Substances Act provides that it is unlawful to:\r\n<blockquote>(1) knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of manu\u00adfacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance;\r\n\r\n(2) manage or control any place, whether permanently or temporarily, either as an owner, lessee, agent, employee, occu\u00adpant, or mortgagee, and knowingly and intentionally rent, lease, profit from, or make available for use, with or without compen\u00adsation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully manufac\u00adturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(1)\u2013(2) (2012).[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nSEPs with safe bathrooms could potentially violate either prong of the federal statute.

Further, the frequency with which clients overdose, the number of needles discarded in the hazardous waste bins, and the general interaction with clients afterward would all support a finding of purpose. By implicitly or explicitly allowing their participants to use the bathrooms for injection, a SEP is purposely accepting drug use on their premises.\r\n\r\nSection 856(a)(2) prohibits an entity with a premises \u201cfrom knowingly and intentionally allowing its use for the purpose\u201d[footnote]<em>Wilson<\/em>, 503 F.3d at 197.[\/footnote] of \u201cunlawfully manufacturing, storing, distributing, or using a controlled substance.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2) (2012).[\/footnote] Therefore, \u201cpurpose\u201d refers to the purpose \u201c<em>not<\/em> of the [entity] with the premises, but rather of those who are permitted to engage in drug-related activities there.\u201d[footnote]<em>Wilson<\/em>, 503 F.3d at 197; see also United States v.

Penal Law \u00a7\u00a0220.03.[\/footnote] The exceptions usually come from the governing public health law.[footnote]See, e.g., id.[\/footnote] However, these laws do not exempt SEPs with safe bathrooms since SEPs were never intended to provide a space for drug use.[footnote]See supra section II.A.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf police find participants using drugs in SEPs with safe bathrooms, the SEP could be held accountable through either actual possession or constructive possession. Constructive possession would be the stronger case. Constructive possession exists when circumstantial evidence shows that an individual who is not actually the possessor has dominion and control over the contraband.[footnote]See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a0220.25. See generally John F. Harvey, Topic Survey, Criminal Law\u2014Establishing Minimum Evidentiary Requirements for Constructive Possession of Narcotics\u2014<em>United States v.

Rev. 921 (1995) (defining constructive possession and highlighting the different interpre\u00adtations of constructive possession used by different circuit courts).[\/footnote] A prosecutor could argue that SEPs with safe bathrooms have dominion and control over those bathrooms and thus have dominion and control over the heroin being used inside them.[footnote]Cf. Considerations for Criminal Justice, supra note 45, at 5\u20137 (noting that SEP staff could face possession charges for drug equipment or even drugs themselves).[\/footnote] For example, in <em>People v. Manini<\/em>, the New York Court of Appeals held that when an entity or person exercises a level of control over the area in which property is found, or over the person from whom the property is seized (sufficient to give him or her the ability to use or dis\u00adpose of the property), the entity or person has constructive possession.[footnote]594 N.E.2d 563, 569 (N.Y. 1992).[\/footnote] Similarly, in Illinois, the defendant in <em>People v.

In some states, constructive possession is interpreted as \u201cknowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u201d Commonwealth v. Brzezinski, 540 N.E.2d 1325, 1331 (Mass. 1989).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>Scott<\/em> bears a striking resemblance to what a case against a SEP with a safe bathroom would look like. Like Mr. Scott, a SEP would have to argue that it had no control or dominion over the person using the drug or the area in which the drug is present or where the drug use is occurring. A prosecutor could counter that a SEP does indeed have control over the participant given that the participant is only allowed into the bathroom with the SEP\u2019s permission.[footnote]See supra section II.A.[\/footnote] Although the SEP could claim that it was not aware of the drug use on its premises, this is a weak argument for many SEPs since some place disposal containers and posters delineating the safest way to inject.[footnote]See supra notes 159\u2013160 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] As previously stated, this sort of evidence would demonstrate knowledge or even purpose.[footnote]See supra notes 159\u2013166 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] Despite this, there are still argu\u00adments that a SEP can make in its defense. Instead of focusing on any control it might have over the bathroom area, a SEP could focus its arguments on its overall lack of dominion over the drug users or the substances themselves more directly.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, officials can exercise prosecutorial discretion to not bring charges against SEPs.[footnote]See supra section I.C.4.[\/footnote] However, prosecutorial discretion is largely dependent on the political climate surrounding the agency or organiza\u00adtion itself.[footnote]See Considerations for Criminal Justice, supra note 45, at 1\u20132 (discussing com\u00adpeting policy objectives faced by police executives).[\/footnote] Regardless, this section demonstrates that there are grounds for liability for SEPs with safe bathrooms, especially when a statute or exemption is not found.[footnote]See supra section I.C.1 (showing how syringe exchange laws do not exempt SEPs from legal liability that would allow them to have safe bathrooms).[\/footnote] Defenses by SEPs arguing that they do not expressly allow drug use are unlikely to be successful given their control over the bathroom areas; after all, SEPs could potentially stop partici\u00adpants from using drugs by putting in blue lights or restricting access to the bathroom itself.[footnote]See IDUHA Statement, supra note 137.[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>C.

Paving the Way for the Legal Acceptance of SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h2>\r\nUntil SIFs are enacted or supported, SEPs with safe bathrooms provide an important service to not only their participants but also the surrounding community. SEPs with safe bathrooms propagate harm reduction ideology.[footnote]See supra section II.A (explaining the goals of harm reduction that justify SEPs providing syringes to drug users).[\/footnote] On a smaller scale, SEPs work to prevent \u201cfatal overdose incidents involving heroin and other opioid drugs.\u201d[footnote]See Burris et al., supra note 32, at 1097 (\u201cInjection drug use\u2014and particularly injection in public\u2014threatens the community well-being in the form of discarded needles and the intoxicated behavior of those who inject publicly.\u201d (footnote omitted)).[\/footnote] Public injection threatens community well-being because drug users will either use drugs on the streets and expose individuals to illegal behavior or leave behind used syringes that endanger bystanders.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Although over\u00addoses do occur, SEP personnel in SEPs with safe bathrooms prevent participant death.[footnote]See Gupta, supra note 133 (noting that personnel are on hand to reverse overdoses); Knefel, supra note 24 (same); see also Bathroom Etiquette, supra note 128 (identifying measures taken to prevent death from overdose).[\/footnote] As previously stated, the Washington Heights CORNER Project announced that many participants use their bathrooms for drug injection.[footnote]Knefel, supra note 24.[\/footnote] Allowing SEPs with safe bathrooms to exist also pre\u00advents drug injection in restaurant and other public restrooms. One study found that 58% of surveyed restaurant managers \u201cencountered drug use in their business bathrooms.\u201d[footnote]Brett Wolfson-Stofko et al., Drug Use in Business Bathrooms: An Exploratory Study of Manager Encounters in New York City, 39 Int\u2019l J.

Section III.A discusses a possible interpretation of SEP and related laws to accommodate safe bathrooms. Section III.B highlights the purpose of \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2) in reconciling it with SEPs that have safe bathrooms. Section III.C examines the potential use of state-of-emergency declarations to protect SEPs with safe bathrooms. Section III.D argues that a SEP with safe bathrooms can aptly excuse its practices with the necessity defense.\r\n<h3>A. State SEP and Related Laws Already Implicitly Authorize SEPs with Safe Bathrooms<\/h3>\r\nAlthough it might seem as though syringe exchange laws are limited to the hypodermic needle itself, these laws can be interpreted to necessi\u00adtate that SEPs have safe bathrooms to meet the requirements in authori\u00adzation statutes.[footnote]N.Y.

When the introduction of SEPs was first being considered, elected officials and their legal counsel acted \u201con reasonable interpreta\u00adtions of unsettled law.\u201d[footnote]Burris, Finucane, Gallagher &amp; Grace, supra note 8, at 1164.[\/footnote] Although lacking a clear legal basis, SEPs have often operated under color of law supported by such reasonable interpretations and \u201cnegotiation[s]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. between exchangers and law enforce\u00adment.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1165.[\/footnote] Consequently, advocates of SEPs with safe bathrooms can argue that it is reasonable to equip bathrooms with items that pro\u00admote safe injection. Participants will use bathroom spaces whether it is encouraged or deterred.[footnote]See Crabtree et al., supra note 127, at 7 (\u201c[I]nstalling blue lights is unlikely to deter injection drugs use in public washrooms, and may increase drug use-related harms.\u201d).[\/footnote] As previously stated, drug users often seek public bathrooms in which to inject without the owner\u2019s permission.[footnote]Bebinger, Ground Zero, supra note 140; cf. Atalanta, A Medical Student Becomes a Diabetic and Finds Public Disapproval, KevinMD (Oct. 31, 2011), http:\/\/\r\nwww.kevinmd.com\/blog\/2011\/10\/medical-student-diabetic-finds-public-disapproval.html [http:\/\/perma.cc\/KC8Y-899Y] (finding disapproval for injecting insulin in public as a diabetic).[\/footnote] SEPs that have actively tried to deter drug injection in their bathrooms have ultimately failed to prevent it.[footnote]See supra notes 127\u2013129 and accompanying text (noting mechanisms imple\u00admented to deter drug use in public bathrooms).[\/footnote] Additionally, at least one study indi\u00adcates that using blue lights to deter drug injection is not effective.[footnote]See Crabtree et al., supra note 127, at 4 (\u201cEven among those who said they would try to avoid blue-lit bathrooms, almost half\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. described strategies they would use to overcome some of the inconvenience imposed by blue lights.\u201d).[\/footnote] The study found that even though drug users do not like blue lights since it \u201cmake[s] it more difficult for them to find their veins,\u201d about half of them \u201cwould not be deterred from injecting in\u201d blue-light bathrooms if they had no alternative.[footnote]Id. at 2, 4\u20135.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSince blue lights are not an absolute deterrence, installing them in a SEP may promote unsafe practices.[footnote]See id. at 2 (\u201cTheoretically, blue lights could compound the risk of injecting in public washrooms by increasing the probability that people who use injection drugs will miss the target vein and inject into surrounding tissue and by promoting other unsafe practices such as deep vein injecting\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).[\/footnote] Other deterring practices would have similar results and effects.[footnote]See supra notes 127\u2013129 and accompanying text (describing the different ways SEPs have tried to deter bathroom injections in the past).[\/footnote] Thus, equipping bathrooms with items that promote safe injection would also serve to ensure staff safety, and it could be interpreted to fall under comprehensive harm reduction ser\u00advices, which some syringe exchange laws require.[footnote]See supra section I.C.1 (detailing the laws in place that mandate that plans include certain requirements under syringe exchange laws).[\/footnote] Additionally, placing sharps containers in SEP bathrooms would help SEP staff to collect used syringes, something syringe exchange laws also require.[footnote]See supra note 209 and accompanying text (describing New York SEP policies for distributing and collecting syringes and referring to other syringe exchange laws).[\/footnote] Since SEPs partially provide the community with syringes, they arguably also have a duty to provide a reliable mechanism for retrieving those needles back. It is reasonable to assume that SEPs can safeguard their bathrooms to conform to syringe exchange program requirements.[footnote]The New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute sets out some safety recommendations for SEPs with bathrooms, which suggest that allowing drug injection in SEPs to occur is a reasonable step as part of complying with syringe exchange laws. See N.Y. State Policies and Procedures, supra note 207, at 10\u201311 (making recommendations such as installing clearly marked naloxone kits, training staff as overdose responders, maintaining hygiene \u201cto avoid injection site infections,\u201d and having an intercom system to facilitate communication between staff and participants using the bathroom).[\/footnote] Notably, this solution is only valid in states that have authorization statutes.[footnote]See supra section I.B.1 (delineating SEP authorization through statutory, judicial, and executive means).[\/footnote]\r\n<h3>B.

Rev. 1805, 1805\u201306 (2008).[\/footnote] Some SEPs are encouraged to safeguard against and prepare for reversing overdoses on the premises.[footnote]The New York State Department of Health has recommended procedures on how to best prevent overdoses in the places where users are likely to use, explicitly mentioning syringe exchange bathrooms. See N.Y. State Policies and Procedures, supra note 207, at 10 (discussing how state recommendations acknowledge that procedures may exist for certain aspects of SEPs that intersect with informal implementation of safer bathrooms in SEPs).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSEPs with safe bathrooms should also not be held liable under \u00a7\u00a0856(a)(2) because they are decidedly different from the entities that have been prosecuted. Defendants normally held liable under 856(a)(2) have either had an interest solely in drug activity itself or been engaged in activities on the premises that go beyond merely safeguarding against overdoses.[footnote]See supra notes 231\u2013235 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] SEPs should not fall within the realm of 856(a)(2) defend\u00adants because their only purpose of having overdose accommodations is to save lives. In <em>United States v. Tebeau<\/em>, the defendant safeguarded against overdose but also instructed security personnel \u201cto move sellers away from the front gates to avoid detection by [law enforcement] officers\u201d and gave them a list of drugs that \u201cwere permissible at the camp.\u201d[footnote]713 F.3d 955, 958 (8th Cir. 2013).[\/footnote] In <em>United States v.

App\u2019x 173, 181 (3d Cir. 2014).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nConsequently, applying \u00a7\u00a0856(a) to SEPs would defeat the purpose of the statute. First, SEPs with safe bathrooms support congressional intent. Passed as part of comprehensive drug legislation, \u00a7\u00a0856 was created \u201c[t]o strengthen Federal efforts to encourage foreign coopera\u00adtion in eradicating illicit drug crops,\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. to provide strong Federal leadership in establishing effective drug abuse prevention and education programs, [and] to expand Federal support for drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation efforts, and for other purposes.\u201d[footnote]132 Cong. Rec. S13,779 (daily ed. Sept. 26, 1986) (excerpt of H.R. 5484). See generally Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207.[\/footnote] Congress envi\u00adsioned that this statute would prevent \u201csituations in which\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. property contributes to the use, manufacture, or distribution of\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. drugs.\u201d[footnote]Rayfield, supra note 241, at 1808.[\/footnote] As previously discussed, SEPs\u2019 activity supports \u201cdrug abuse treatment and rehabilitation efforts\u201d; thus, \u00a7\u00a0856\u2019s application to SEPs with safe bathrooms would undercut one of the statute\u2019s animating purposes.\r\n\r\nSecond, the recent expansion of \u00a7\u00a0856(a) supports that SEPs with safe bathrooms are not encompassed within the purpose of \u00a7\u00a0856(a) because they do not encourage drug use to obtain a profit or the drug consumption itself. In 2003, Congress passed the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, which amended \u00a7\u00a0856(a) to more directly pass on criminal liability to rave promoters and nightclub owners.[footnote]See Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, Pub. L.

As previously stated, these SEPs promote safety and are prepared to actively prevent overdoses to the extent that they occur within their premises.

SEPs with Safe Bathrooms Act out of Necessity<\/h3>\r\nUnder the \u201cnecessity\u201d defense, an entity may legally act in an otherwise criminal manner in order to avoid greater harm in emergency situations.[footnote]Although courts sometimes treat justification and necessity as interchangeable, they are not the same. See Edward B. Arnolds &amp; Norman F. Garland, The Defense of Necessity in Criminal Law: The Right to Choose the Lesser Evil, 65 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 289, 289 (1975). A justification is not necessity because it is not an excuse. Id. Justification \u201cmakes harmful conduct proper and noncriminal\u201d while excuse \u201cexcuses the actor from criminal liability even though the actor was technically not justified in what he did.\u201d Id. at 289\u201390. For a discussion on destroying property and the necessity defense, see generally George C. Christie, The Defense of Necessity Considered from the Legal and Moral Points of View, 48 Duke L.J. 975, 981 (1999).[\/footnote] This defense is found in most states and is mostly accepted.[footnote]See Laura J. Schulkind, Note, Applying the Necessity Defense to Civil Disobedience Cases, 64 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 79, 82 n.17 (1989) (\u201cVirtually all jurisdictions have rejected the traditional requirement that the emergency arise out of a physical force of nature, such as flood or fire.\u201d).[\/footnote] Generally, the elements are that (1) the defendant acted to avoid a significant risk of harm, (2) no adequate lawful means could have been used to escape the harm, and (3) the harm avoided was greater than that caused by breaking the law.[footnote]See id. at 82 (\u201cThe common elements of the necessity defense\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. include the following: (1) the actor has acted to avoid a significant evil; (2) there are no adequate legal means to escape the harm; and (3) the remedy is not disproportionate to the evil sought to be avoided.\u201d).[\/footnote] The necessity defense was developed through the common law[footnote]See Arnolds &amp; Garland, supra note 263, at 291 (explaining the history and elements of the necessity defense).[\/footnote] and has been used to justify illegal actions to prevent the spread of fire, disease, and death.[footnote]See Seavey v. Preble, 64 Me. 120, 123 (1874) (using necessity to shield a doctor from liability when he damaged property in the course of preventing the spread of smallpox). Note that the necessity defense cannot be used to \u201cexcuse criminal activity intended to express the protestor\u2019s disagreement with positions reached by the lawmaking branches of the government.\u201d United States v. Dorrell, 758 F.2d 427, 432 (9th Cir. 1985).[\/footnote] The rationale behind this defense is that a person should not be punished if \u201chis act of breaking the law prevents more evil than it causes.\u201d[footnote]See Arnolds &amp; Garland, supra note 263, at 290 (\u201cThe rationale behind the excuse defenses was stated by Mr. Justice Holmes: \u2018Detached reflection cannot be expected in the presence of an uplifted knife.\u2019\u201d (quoting Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 343 (1921))).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOriginally, SEPs used this argument to justify having hypodermic needles because they were \u201cnecessary to avert a greater harm\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [of] the imminent danger of needle-borne transmission of disease.\u201d[footnote]Considerations for Criminal Justice, supra note 45, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Gostin &amp; Lazzarini, supra note 254, at 686).[\/footnote] In one study, the defendants in the majority of the cases examined escaped con\u00adviction primarily due to the necessity defense.[footnote]Burris, Finucane, Gallagher &amp; Grace, supra note 8, at 1162\u201363 (examining the legal strategies used in operating SEPs across the United States and finding that \u201c[i]n all but two cases [studied], defendants escaped conviction through either jury nullification or the successful use of the necessity defense\u201d).[\/footnote] Although the potential use of this argument has been effective for deterring prosecution or conviction, this argument has produced mixed results in different states. For example, New York and New Jersey accepted the defense while Massachusetts did not consider it.[footnote]Considerations for Criminal Justice, supra note 45, at 6.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\n<em>People v. Bordowitz<\/em> was one of the first cases in which necessity was used as a defense against being charged for knowingly possessing hypodermic instruments.[footnote]588 N.Y.S.2d 507 (Crim. Ct. 1991).[\/footnote] The court explained that possession of hypodermic needles, while illegal under the statute, was justified because preventing the sharing of used needles could avert the greater harm of spread of HIV.[footnote]See id. at 512 (\u201cThe distinction, in broadest terms, during this age of the AIDS crisis is death by using dirty needles versus drug addiction by using clean needles. The defendants\u2019 actions sought to avoid the greater harm.\u201d).[\/footnote] The court reasoned that there were no \u201cmeaningful available options\u201d because \u201cevidence revealed [that] insufficient drug programs exist[ed] for the number of addicts in New York.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 511.[\/footnote] The defendants\u2019 acts of possession were reasonable since they were \u201cnecessary as an emergency measure to avert an imminent public injury.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEven if SEPs with safe bathrooms have intentionally and knowingly violated possession laws or the crack-house statute, defendants could argue that they \u201cnevertheless\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. have committed no crime.\u201d[footnote]See Arnolds &amp; Garland, supra note 263, at 289 (explaining the rationale of using the defense of necessity).[\/footnote] The result of applying this defense in the different states would likely be mixed, but much more favorable to SEPs with safe bathrooms than it was in the past since there is the benefit of SEP case precedent. Since SEPs have proven to be helpful, SEPs with safe bathrooms would have a basis to be looked at as helpful too. Indeed, \u201cevidence of the efficacy of syringe exchange has continued to grow.\u201d[footnote]Burris, Finucane, Gallagher &amp; Grace, supra note 8, at 1164.[\/footnote] As of now, more states are accepting of SEPs.[footnote]See supra note 70 and accompanying text (noting the increase of SEPs in a majority of states).[\/footnote] Additionally, evidence of success from the different countries that have SIFs can also be used to advance harm reduction in the United States.[footnote]See MSIC Evaluation Comm., Final Report of the Evaluation of the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre 36 (2003), http:\/\/www.indro-online.de\/\r\nsydneyfinalreport.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/N5HX-Y94N] (noting that in Sydney, Australia, SIFs \u201ceffectively managed 409 drug overdoses with no reported ongoing adverse squeal\u201d and that \u201c[s]everal other clinical and behavioural incidents were also managed\u201d); Kate Dolan et al., Drug Consumption Facilities in Europe and the Establishment of Supervised Injecting Centres in Australia, 19 Drug &amp; Alcohol Rev. 337, 338 (2000) (\u201cSupervised injecting centres currently operate in a number of cities in The Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

If it comes down to allowing deaths due to overdose or breaking the law, SEPs with safe bathrooms could argue that they should break the law.

In other cases, which have received less attention, the price stays high longer than it should. Either way, anticompetitive behavior often lurks behind inflated prices.\r\n\r\nBy delaying price-reducing generic competition, this behavior forces consumers to spend billions of extra dollars each year. Brand drug companies have engaged in an array of conduct to delay generic entry. They have entered into agreements by which they pay generic manufacturers to settle patent litigation and delay entering the market.[footnote]E.g., FTC v. Actavis, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 2229 (2013) (holding that settlements involv\u00ading payment and delayed entry could have \u201csignificant adverse effects on competition\u201d and violate antitrust law).[\/footnote] They have engaged in \u201cproduct hopping,\u201d switching from one version of a drug to another, often to delay generic entry.[footnote]E.g., New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 643 (2d Cir. 2015) (describing \u201cproduct hopping\u201d as \u201cconduct by a monopolist to perpetuate patent exclusivity through successive products\u201d).[\/footnote] And they have restricted their distribution systems to prevent generics from obtaining needed sam\u00adples.[footnote]See Michael A. Carrier et al., Using Antitrust Law to Challenge Turing\u2019s Daraprim Price Increase, 31 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 1379, 1386 (2016).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother one of these strategies, which has flown under the radar until recently, involves \u201ccitizen petitions\u201d filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although intended to serve the public interest by bringing safety concerns to the agency\u2019s attention, nearly all petitions today that target generic drugs are denied.[footnote]See Michael A. Carrier &amp; Carl J. Minniti III, Citizen Petitions: Long, Late-Filed, and At-Last Denied, 66 Am. U. L. Rev. 305, 308 (2016) [hereinafter Carrier &amp; Minniti, Citizen Petitions] (finding that the FDA denies 92% of petitions targeting pending generics).[\/footnote] Despite the low suc\u00adcess rate, petitions are still able to delay generic entry and hamstring the FDA. This Piece provides an overview of citizen petitions and the anti\u00adcompetitive harm they threaten and offers five solutions to address the problem posed by abusive citizen petitions.\r\n<h2>I. The Setting<\/h2>\r\nCitizen petitions allow any party to raise safety or effectiveness con\u00adcerns with drugs the FDA is considering for approval.[footnote]See, e.g., 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a010.25(a) (2016) (\u201cAn interested person may petition the Commissioner to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or to take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action.\u201d); id. at \u00a7 10.30 (specifying requirements of citizen petitions).[\/footnote] The petitions, with a foundation in the First Amendment[footnote]U.S. Const. amend. I (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d).[\/footnote] and Administrative Procedure Act,[footnote]5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0553(e) (2012) (requiring government agencies to provide the public with \u201cthe right to petition for issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule\u201d).[\/footnote] in theory play an important role in ensuring that drugs are safe and effective. In practice, however, brand firms have used peti\u00adtions to delay generic approval, extending monopolies on their products at a potential cost to consumers of millions of dollars per day. In many cases, petitions offer little incremental value to the review process but require considera\u00adble time, with the FDA forced to address the merits of every petition, many of which contain \u201cdetailed analysis and precise scien\u00adtific doc\u00adumentation\u201d and require review by \u201cmultiple disciplines\u201d within the agency.[footnote]The Generic Drug Maze: Speeding Access to Affordable, Life-Saving Drugs: Hearing Before the S. Spec. Comm. on Aging, 109th Cong. 14 (2006) (statement of Gary Buehler, Director, Office of Generic Drugs, FDA).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne type of petition has caused particular concern. As part of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), Congress created Section 505(q),[footnote]Pub. L. No. 110-85, \u00a7 914, 121 Stat. 823, 953\u201357 (2007) (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q) (2012)).[\/footnote] which applies to \u201ccertain petitions that request that the FDA take any form of action\u201d related to a pending Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA or \u201cgeneric application\u201d).[footnote]153 Cong. Rec. 25,047 (2007).[\/footnote] Congress intended to reduce delays[footnote]Ctr. for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., OMB Control No. 0910-0679, Citizen Petitions and Petitions for Stay of Action Subject to Section 505(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for Industry 1 (2014) [hereinafter Guidance for Industry], http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/downloads\/drugs\/\r\nguidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation\/guidances\/ucm079353.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\nF9V2-X46A].[\/footnote] by requiring petitioners to certify that they did not delay in filing the petition[footnote]See 153 Cong. Rec. 25,047.[\/footnote] and mandating that the FDA take final action no later than 180 days[footnote]21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a010.30(e)(2) (2016).[\/footnote] (later shortened to 150 days) after the petition\u2019s filing date, unless delay would be necessary to protect the public health.[footnote]Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Pub. L. No. 112-144, 126 Stat. 993 (2012). For a discussion of how the legislation has not been successful, see infra notes 37\u201338 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nBrand firms have filed the vast majority of 505(q) petitions, seeking additional testing or questioning whether generics are bioequivalent\u2014 that is, able to be absorbed into the body at the same rate.[footnote]See Carrier &amp; Minniti, Citizen Petitions, supra note 6, at 328.[\/footnote] The FDA denied 92% of 505(q) petitions filed between 2011 and 2015, with this figure rising to 98% for petitions filed within six months of the expiration of a patent or FDA exclusivity date.[footnote]Id. at 333, 341. \u201cFDA exclusivity\u201d refers to a period in which the agency cannot approve other products because of, for example, the development of a drug with a new active ingredient, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(j)(5)(F)(ii) (2012), or the running of new clinical trials, see id. \u00a7\u00a0355(c)(3)(E)(iii).[\/footnote] In addition to these general find\u00adings, particular examples demonstrate anticompetitive harm in the form of:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Multiple petitions (such as Teva\u2019s eight petitions on MS-treating Copaxone and Shire ViroPharma\u2019s twenty-four peti\u00adtions on the medication treating a life-threatening gastroin\u00adtestinal infection);[footnote]See Carrier &amp; Minniti, Citizen Petitions, supra note 6, at 344\u201346; see also Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief at 14, FTC v.

Online 53, 64\u201366 (2017) [hereinafter Carrier &amp; Minniti, How Mylan Hiked Prices].[\/footnote]<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nTo pick one example, in February 2017, the FTC filed its first com\u00adplaint challenging citizen petition conduct as an antitrust violation.[footnote]Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief, supra note 19, at 14.[\/footnote] The FTC alleged that ViroPharma \u201cinundated the FDA\u201d with twenty-four citizen petitions and twenty-two other filings, which was \u201cby far the most filings that any firm has ever made to the FDA concerning a single drug product.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1\u20132.[\/footnote] The agency alleged that \u201c[t]hese repetitive, serial, and merit\u00adless filings lacked any supporting clinical data\u201d but that \u201cViroPharma\u2019s campaign had succeeded in delaying generic entry at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 2.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNot only do petitions threaten the public but they also harm the FDA, which has lamented the deluge of petitions that has forced it to expend resources \u201cat the expense of completing the other work of the Agency.\u201d[footnote]FDA, Report to Congress: Eighth Annual Report on Delays in Approvals of Applications Related to Citizen Petitions and Petitions for Stay of Agency Action for Fiscal Year 2015, at 1\u20138 (2016) [hereinafter FY 2015 Report], http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/downloads\/\r\nAboutFDA\/CentersOffices\/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco\/CDER\/ReportsBudgets\/UCM517279.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/5UN7-T9NL].[\/footnote] The FDA also bemoaned the \u201cstrain on Agency resources\u201d from Congress\u2019s reduction of the response period by 30 days to 150 days, which \u201caffords [the] FDA even less time to evaluate the issues raised in the petitions and to provide a response that articulates the scientific and legal reasoning supporting the Agency\u2019s decision.\u201d[footnote]FDA, Report to Congress: Seventh Annual Report on Delays in Approvals of Applications Related to Citizen Petitions and Petitions for Stay of Agency Action for Fiscal Year 2014, at 10 (2015) [hereinafter FY 2014 Report], http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/downloads\/\r\nAboutFDA\/CentersOffices\/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco\/CDER\/ReportsBudgets\/UCM464282.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/XZG8-N5BB].[\/footnote] In addition, the FDA has revealed frustration with \u201cserial 505(q) petitions, frequently from the same petitioner, about the same specific drug or class of drugs\u201d that require \u201cseveral separate responses about different issues regarding the same product.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe FDA\u2019s concerns are accompanied by the public\u2019s difficulty in uncovering information about petitions, which obscures the prevalence of the conduct and the full extent of the delay. The government website regulations.gov is difficult to navigate,[footnote]For example, www.regulations.gov requires a researcher looking for 505(q) petitions to comb through individual petitions filed with the FDA and identify those petitions that include a 505(q) certification statement.[\/footnote] leading to dependence on the privately compiled collection at FDALawBlog.[footnote]FDA Citizen Petition Tracker, FDA Law Blog, http:\/\/www.fdalawblog.net\/\r\nfda_law_blog_hyman_phelps\/files\/CPTracker.xls (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (last visited Aug. 15, 2017).[\/footnote] Moreover, the FDA does not provide a comprehensive account of delay from petitions targeting generics. In its annual reports to Congress, the FDA has found \u201cdelayed approvals\u201d on only ten occasions between 2008 and 2015.[footnote]FY 2015 Report, supra note 26, at 8.[\/footnote] The agency, however, does not specify these petitions, nor does it consider a petition delayed if it responds within the 150-day period.[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 9 (finding that \u201ca petition answered within the [150-day] statutory deadline does not delay approval of a pending application\u201d).[\/footnote] Relatedly, the FDA has failed to consider that it could be delaying generic approval by not approving the generic until it resolves the petition.[footnote]See infra Part III.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCongress attempted to address concerns presented by citizen peti\u00adtions in the FDAAA.[footnote]See supra notes 11\u201316 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] It allowed the FDA to delay its approval of a ge\u00adneric only if the delay was \u201cnecessary to protect the public health.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(A)(i) (2012).[\/footnote] And it required that the agency provide certain types of information to Congress each year.[footnote]See infra note 39 and accompanying text (listing requirements of annual reports submitted to Congress). [\/footnote] But this legislation was not successful in its goal of \u201cstop[ping] frivolous petitions from delaying generic entry,\u201d[footnote]153 Cong. Rec. 10,924 (2007) (statement of Sen. Debbie Stabenow).[\/footnote] as the num\u00adber of petitions increased after the law went into effect and has shown no signs of abating.[footnote]See Michael A. Carrier &amp; Daryl Wander, Citizen Petitions: An Empirical Study, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 249, 282 (2012).[\/footnote] This Piece picks up where the FDAAA left off, proposing five solutions to the citizen petition problem: (1) increasing transparency; (2) shedding light on simultaneous decisions on peti\u00adtions and generic approval; (3) facilitating the FDA\u2019s summary disposi\u00adtions of petitions; (4) addressing resource waste; and (5) promoting timely filed petitions.\r\n<h2>II. Enhance Transparency<\/h2>\r\nThe first proposal would increase transparency. The FDA currently is required to provide annual reports to Congress that specify certain types of information:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of applications that were approved during the preceding 12-month period\u201d;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of such applications whose effective dates were delayed by [the above-referenced] petitions\u201d;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of days by which such applications were so delayed\u201d; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of such petitions that were submitted during such period.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(3).[\/footnote]<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nDespite this information, the FDA never explains which petitions it believes have resulted in delay. And again, the agency considers a petition to be delayed only if it does not respond within the 150-day period.[footnote]Supra note 32.[\/footnote] It is possible, however, that a petition leads to delayed entry even within the 150-day period. The FDA, for example, might approve a generic later than it would have if the petition had not been filed. For these reasons, Congress should require the FDA to specify additional categories of information, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Every 505(q) petition;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The timing of the petition in relation to the expiration date of patents listed in the Orange Book[footnote]The Orange Book is an annual compilation of drugs and their associated patents. FDA, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (37th ed. 2017), http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/downloads\/Drugs\/DevelopmentApprovalProcess\/pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/A663-TYBX].[\/footnote] for the brand drug referenced by the generic application;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The time the FDA expended on the petition; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The delay (if any) in generic approval caused by the petition and determination of how the delay is calculated.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe FDA can provide this information in its annual report to Congress or on its website (like it does for patents listed in the Orange Book, generic applications, and products requiring Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)[footnote]REMS, which often take the form of restrictions on a drug\u2019s distribution, ensure that a drug\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355-1(a)(1).[\/footnote]). Each of the categories would address certain current deficiencies. By providing a list of every 505(q) petition, the FDA would make it significantly easier to research and analyze peti\u00adtions. Including information on when the petitions were filed would high\u00adlight late filings in relation to patents. The third category would, as discussed in more detail below,[footnote]See infra Part V (discussing the FDA\u2019s time and cost expenditure on each petition).[\/footnote] shed light on FDA resources expended on petitions. And the fourth category would provide more useful infor\u00admation than is currently available on delay from petitions.\r\n\r\nIn short, these additional categories would provide valuable infor\u00admation that is currently missing and would highlight the significant con\u00adcerns presented by citizen petitions.\r\n<h2>III. Elucidate Simultaneous Resolutions<\/h2>\r\nA second proposal targets a particular instance of transparency, which involves simultaneous determinations. On certain occasions, the FDA denies a citizen petition at the same time it grants generic approval. Some of these decisions occur within a short time (for example, one month) of each other while others occur on the same day. Although the FDA has never acknowledged doing so, industry observers have com\u00admented that the agency\u2019s \u201cpractice for many years has been to simultane\u00adously announce both decisions.\u201d[footnote]Kurt R. Karst et al., How FDA Announces Drug Approval Decisions: A Broken FDA \u201cSystem\u201d that Must Be Fixed, FDA Law Blog 1, http:\/\/www.fdalawblog.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/archives\/docs\/Drug%20Approval%20Decision%20Paper.pdf [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/QF4E-UCM7] (last visited Jan. 31, 2018).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe FDA\u2019s control over the timing of decisions relating to petitions and generic approval has been criticized, with one court lamenting the \u201cmess\u201d that prevented \u201cthe opportunity to actually review the FDA\u2019s actual decision and actual reasoning\u201d on the citizen petition before the agency reached a decision on the generic application.[footnote]Id. at 5 (citing AstraZeneca Pharms. LP v. Burwell, 197 F. Supp. 3d 53 (D.D.C. 2016)); cf. id. at 3\u20134 (citing Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co. v. FDA, 587 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2008)) (expressing \u201cconcern that FDA would be making a decision on exclusivity without either company having the ability to challenge that decision before facing irreparable harm\u201d).[\/footnote] An industry ex\u00adpert concluded that \u201cthe current FDA system to announce\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. hotly con\u00adtested decisions is broken,\u201d with \u201cwhatever advantage\u201d the agency \u201cmay think it is getting from hiding the ball from the world on the timing and substance of these decisions\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. more than overcome by the criticism the Agency has received from judges.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 8.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhen the FDA issues simultaneous rulings, one concern is that the generic would have been approved <em>earlier<\/em> absent the petition. As dis\u00adcussed above, petitions often require multiple divisions of the FDA to review detailed documentation, slowing down the approval process.[footnote]See supra note 10 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] But as long as the decision is reached within 150 days, the FDA does not count these as instances of delay in its annual report.[footnote]See supra note 32 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] For example, the FDA asserts that there is no delay when the 150-day period ends before the generic is \u201cready for approval,\u201d without considering whether the peti\u00adtion itself <em>delayed<\/em> approval.[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 9.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis position seems inconsistent with the agency\u2019s guidance. In determining whether a petition would delay a generic application (which is allowed only to protect health),[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(A) (2012).[\/footnote] it applies a \u201cbut for\u201d test to deter\u00admine delay that asks if the generic would be \u201cready for approval but for the issues raised by the petition.\u201d[footnote]Guidance for Industry, supra note 13, at 8.[\/footnote] Given the information currently available to the public, it is not possible for observers to determine this. Applying its \u201cbut for\u201d analysis, the agency should make clear when it was likely to have approved the generic absent the petition.\r\n\r\nA second concern is that the FDA delays announcing a petition deci\u00adsion it has <em>already reached<\/em> until it formally approves the generic applica\u00adtion. In this scenario, the petition does not delay the generic, but the FDA delays the <em>announcement<\/em> of the petition\u2019s denial so that it is made simultaneously with the generic\u2019s approval. The FDA may engage in this conduct to eliminate the possibility of judicial review of the petition decision.\r\n\r\nThe FDA has demonstrated concern that rulings on petitions \u201cconsti\u00adtute final Agency action and are subject to immediate review by the courts.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 14; see also Amendments to Regulations on Citizen Petitions, Petitions for Stay of Action, and Submission of Documents to Dockets, 81 Fed. Reg. 78,500, 78,504 (Nov. 8, 2016) (\u201cFDA is considered to have taken final Agency action on a petition if either: (1) FDA makes a final decision\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. during the 150-day period or (2) the 150-day period expires without FDA making a final decision.\u201d).[\/footnote] As a result, petition rulings \u201ccarry with them none of the procedural rights\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that attach to a decision to deny\u201d generic approval.[footnote]Guidance for Industry, supra note 13, at 14 (explaining how, after the FDA denies an application for approval, it \u201cmust give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a hearing on whether the application is approvable, with a specific timeframe and process\u201d).[\/footnote] Rulings on petitions before decisions on generic approval thus \u201ccould interfere with the statutory and regulatory scheme governing the review of applications and related procedural rights of applicants.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMore skeptically, the FDA may be delaying petition rulings so that it is less likely to be sued in court. A petition denied before generic approval may be appealed to the courts, but one announced simultane\u00adously with the approval decision is less likely to be challenged since in that case the generic has received approval and may be on the market shortly thereafter, which would dissuade a brand firm seeking to keep a generic off the market.\r\n\r\nShedding light on the timing of simultaneous decisions\u2014including determinations of (1) when the generic would have received approval absent the petition and (2) when the FDA would have announced the petition decision absent the pending generic application\u2014would help resolve these contentious issues.\r\n<h2>IV. Facilitate Summary Disposition<\/h2>\r\nThird, Congress could make it easier for the FDA to quickly dispose of certain petitions. Because the legislature understood that some peti\u00adtions raised significant concern, it allowed the FDA to summarily dispense with them. This authority, however, has never been used.[footnote]See Sarah Zhang, How Pharma Companies Use \u2018Citizen Petitions\u2019 to Keep Drug Prices High, Atlantic (Mar. 8, 2017), http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2017\/\r\n03\/pharma-citizen-petitions-drug-prices\/518544\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/735VG7QM] (\u201c[T]he FDA can summarily deny petitions that it finds frivolous\u2014but it never has.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the standard is too high. Section 505(q)(1)(E) requires the FDA to conclude that a petition is \u201csubmitted with the pri\u00admary purpose of delaying\u201d the generic application and that \u201cthe petition does not on its face raise valid scientific or regulatory issues.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(E) (2012).[\/footnote] But the provi\u00adsion \u201chas neither curbed the filing of petitions submitted with the primary purpose of delay\u201d nor \u201cpermitted FDA to dispose of such peti\u00adtions without expending substantial amounts of resources.\u201d[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 10.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs the agency has explained, the standards for summary disposition are \u201cextremely difficult to meet.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] For starters, the FDA cannot deter\u00admine a petitioner\u2019s primary purpose based on the petition itself. Merely reviewing such a document, which includes safety or effectiveness con\u00adcerns, cannot reveal the filer\u2019s purpose, let alone its primary purpose.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even a petition that ultimately is denied will tend not to reveal \u201con its face\u201d that it \u201cdoes not\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. raise valid scientific or regulatory issues.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(E).[\/footnote] Petitions will include language and sometimes documentation challenging a drug\u2019s safety or efficacy that at first glance may sound plausi\u00adble. The FDA would be hesitant to rule in a cursory review that the petition does not raise valid issues. Its concern is obvious: that errone\u00adously granted summary dispositions result in safety mishaps years down the road.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done? First, remove the two conditions. The FDA can\u00adnot determine purpose from the petition itself, nor can it dismiss peti\u00adtions raising safety or effectiveness concerns based on a document\u2019s \u201cface.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn place of these requirements, the agency could focus on timing. Legitimate petitions should be filed within a reasonably short time of dis\u00adcovering the safety or efficacy concern. Late-filed petitions raise the con\u00adcern that the petitioner is gaming the system, often by waiting until a generic is about to enter the market to file even though it was long aware of the information forming the basis of the petition.\r\n\r\nAs one example, Mylan received widespread notoriety for its price in\u00adcreases on the life-saving epinephrine-autoinjector EpiPen device.[footnote]See Willingham, supra note 2. [\/footnote] Not receiving as much attention was Mylan\u2019s filing of a petition challeng\u00ading Teva\u2019s EpiPen alternative at least five years after it most likely was aware of the generic product specifications.[footnote]See Carrier &amp; Minniti, How Mylan Hiked Prices, supra note 22, at 65; see also infra notes 69\u201374 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCongress could consider replacing Section 505(q)(1)(E) with lan\u00adguage emphasizing the filing of petitions within a reasonable time, with one year providing sufficient time to prepare a petition. One poten\u00adtial statutory amendment (which includes a waiver for unusual circum\u00adstances[footnote]One such circumstance could include the situation in which (1) a new study shows that a molecule is harmful in population X; (2) two years later, a different study shows that the molecule may also be harmful in population Y, which is similar to population X; and (3) a petition is then filed asserting that a generic should not be approved for treating population Y. It is arguable that a petition should have been filed two years earlier due to the similarities between populations X and Y. Allowing a waiver eliminates any ambiguity that could be used to reject the petition based on late filing.[\/footnote]) could provide:\r\n\r\n505(q) petitions must be filed within one year of the petitioner learning of the safety or efficacy issue asserted in the petition. FDA may grant a waiver to allow later filing.\r\n\r\nSuch an amendment would make it more difficult to file questiona\u00adble petitions. And by focusing on the delay in filing, the analysis would pinpoint concerns based on timing, which raise red flags and can be dis\u00adcerned, rather than the filer\u2019s purpose or problems on the peti\u00adtion\u2019s face, which cannot readily be determined.[footnote]If challenged, the proposal should survive First Amendment scrutiny as a content-neutral restriction that (1) does not completely block petitioning and (2) serves an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression in (a) solving a public health problem of consumers paying unwarranted monopoly prices from abusive petitions and (b) addressing the failure of prior efforts by the FDA and Congress to remedy the problem. See United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968); see also supra notes 26\u201328 and 34\u201338 and accompanying text (discussing previous failures to find a solution). Previous widely acknowledged failures to solve the problem show that the recommendation \u201cpromotes a substantial government interest\u201d that would otherwise \u201cbe achieved less effectively.\u201d See United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689 (1985).[\/footnote]\r\n<h2>V. Address Resource Waste<\/h2>\r\nA fourth proposal would require the FDA to disclose the money and time it expends resolving 505(q) petitions. In its Eighth Report to Congress, the FDA was \u201cconcerned about the resources required to respond to 505(q) petitions within the 150-day deadline at the expense of completing [its] other work.\u201d[footnote]FY 2015 Report, supra note 26, at 8.[\/footnote] And in its Seventh Report, it explained that the reduction from 180 to 150 days \u201cincreased the strain on Agency resources,\u201d which required it \u201cto direct resources away from other important initiatives to attempt to comply with the new shorter deadline.\u201d[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 10.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPutting dollar and time figures on the resource drain from petition responses could offer important benefits. It would make the problems posed by citizen petitions more concrete and provide greater impetus for changes. As it stands now, the theoretical arguments based on freedom of expression and the possibility of raising legitimate concerns with the FDA, combined with inertia and the difficulty of limiting existing proce\u00addures, make it more difficult to impose limits on the process. Concrete figures depicting the resources expended on petitions, when considered in the setting of the overwhelming incidence of denials,[footnote]See supra note 18 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] could pave the way for changes.\r\n<h2>VI. Promote Timeliness<\/h2>\r\nFifth, Congress could amend section 505(q)(1)(H) to require a peti\u00adtioner to certify that it filed its objection within a reasonable time\u2014say, one year\u2014of discovering the claim that is the basis of the petition. Currently, the section requires the petitioner to certify that the petition includes \u201call information and views upon which the petition relies\u201d and \u201crepresentative data and\/or information known to the petitioner which are unfavorable to the petition,\u201d and that it took \u201creasonable steps to ensure that any representative data and\/or information which are unfavor\u00adable to the petition were disclosed.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(H) (2012).[\/footnote] The petitioner is also re\u00adquired to \u201ccertify that the information upon which\u201d the action requested is based \u201cfirst became known\u201d on a date the party specifies.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAlthough it would appear that these requirements would result in peti\u00adtions that are timely filed, that is not always the case. Petitioners sometimes file long after becoming aware of the basis for the petition. One example appears with Mylan\u2019s citizen petition against Teva\u2019s Epi-Pen alternative, filed on January 16, 2015.[footnote]Citizen Petition from Mylan Specialty, L.P., No. FDA-2015-P-0181-0001 at 1 (posted Jan. 20, 2015); see also Carrier &amp; Minniti, How Mylan Hiked Prices, supra note 22, at 64.[\/footnote] In a development of which the industry would be keenly aware, Teva filed its ANDA against the Epi-Pen in 2008.[footnote]Larry Smith, <em>The Promise of the Antares Pipeline is the Basis of My Buy Recommendation<\/em>, Smith On Stocks (Jan. 25, 2012), http:\/\/smithonstocks.com\/the-promise-of-the-antares-pipeline-is-the-basis-of-my-buy-recommendation-ais-2-40 [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/4UJE-8B8B].[\/footnote] And court documents show that Teva produced its ANDA filing in the course of litigation on September 17, 2010.[footnote]Defendants\u2019 Brief in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss at 6, King Pharm., Inc. v. Teva Parenteral Meds. Inc., No. 09-CV-652-GMS (D. Del. filed Dec. 13, 2010), 2010 WL 7583650.[\/footnote] This material included \u201cdetailed product descriptions, drawings, and instructions for use\u201d for Teva\u2019s proposed generic.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt the time (and to this day), Mylan (as distributor and marketer) was working hand-in-hand with Meridian\/King (manufacturer), with the former taking over Orange Book sponsorship of the drug application and the latter targeting rivals in litigation.[footnote]Complaint at 2, King Pharm., Inc. v. Teva Parenteral Meds. Inc., No. 09-CV652-GMS (D. Del. filed Aug. 28, 2009), 2009 WL 2849496.[\/footnote] It thus seems exceedingly likely that Mylan would have been aware of Teva\u2019s ANDA in 2008 and aware of documents explaining Teva\u2019s product in 2010. In fact, it was <em>Mylan<\/em> that announced the settlement of the litigation, confirming its close connection to the case.[footnote]<em>See Mylan and Pfizer Announce Epinephrine Auto-injector Settlement Agreement with Teva<\/em>, Mylan (Apr. 26, 2012), http:\/\/newsroom.mylan.com\/press-releases?item=123144 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/V7EX-T49J].[\/footnote] This connection raises significant con\u00adcerns that Mylan waited more than four years to file its citizen petition in 2015.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to section 505(q)(1)(H) to require a petitioner to certify that it filed its objection within one year of discovering the claim underlying the petition would help address the situation. The end of the section could include the following language:\r\n\r\nThe petitioner must certify that it became aware of the infor\u00admation upon which the action requested is based within one year of the petition.\r\n\r\nPutting a timeframe on the obligation could make it more concrete and more difficult to evade. At the same time, one year should be enough time to research potential concerns with the generic drug. A certi\u00adfication requiring filing within one year would make clear that peti\u00adtions cannot be used to delay generic entry.[footnote]For an overview of the First Amendment implications of this proposal, see supra note 63 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nCitizen petitions have recently received attention as a tool by which brand firms have delayed generic entry, allowing them to maintain their monopolies and preventing consumers from enjoying lower prices. The FDA has revealed concern with the resources it expends on petitions and has recently denied nearly all petitions targeting generic entry.\r\n\r\nThe five proposals offered in this Piece would address the most egre\u00adgious aspects of the process. They would increase transparency, allow the dismissal of frivolous petitions, and prevent some of the most flagrant instances of delayed generic entry. Given high drug prices, the five pro\u00adposals are worth attention.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

In other cases, which have received less attention, the price stays high longer than it should. Either way, anticompetitive behavior often lurks behind inflated prices.\r\n\r\nBy delaying price-reducing generic competition, this behavior forces consumers to spend billions of extra dollars each year. Brand drug companies have engaged in an array of conduct to delay generic entry. They have entered into agreements by which they pay generic manufacturers to settle patent litigation and delay entering the market.[footnote]E.g., FTC v. Actavis, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 2229 (2013) (holding that settlements involv\u00ading payment and delayed entry could have \u201csignificant adverse effects on competition\u201d and violate antitrust law).[\/footnote] They have engaged in \u201cproduct hopping,\u201d switching from one version of a drug to another, often to delay generic entry.[footnote]E.g., New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 643 (2d Cir. 2015) (describing \u201cproduct hopping\u201d as \u201cconduct by a monopolist to perpetuate patent exclusivity through successive products\u201d).[\/footnote] And they have restricted their distribution systems to prevent generics from obtaining needed sam\u00adples.[footnote]See Michael A. Carrier et al., Using Antitrust Law to Challenge Turing\u2019s Daraprim Price Increase, 31 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 1379, 1386 (2016).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAnother one of these strategies, which has flown under the radar until recently, involves \u201ccitizen petitions\u201d filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although intended to serve the public interest by bringing safety concerns to the agency\u2019s attention, nearly all petitions today that target generic drugs are denied.[footnote]See Michael A. Carrier &amp; Carl J. Minniti III, Citizen Petitions: Long, Late-Filed, and At-Last Denied, 66 Am. U. L. Rev. 305, 308 (2016) [hereinafter Carrier &amp; Minniti, Citizen Petitions] (finding that the FDA denies 92% of petitions targeting pending generics).[\/footnote] Despite the low suc\u00adcess rate, petitions are still able to delay generic entry and hamstring the FDA. This Piece provides an overview of citizen petitions and the anti\u00adcompetitive harm they threaten and offers five solutions to address the problem posed by abusive citizen petitions.\r\n<h2>I. The Setting<\/h2>\r\nCitizen petitions allow any party to raise safety or effectiveness con\u00adcerns with drugs the FDA is considering for approval.[footnote]See, e.g., 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a010.25(a) (2016) (\u201cAn interested person may petition the Commissioner to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or to take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action.\u201d); id. at \u00a7 10.30 (specifying requirements of citizen petitions).[\/footnote] The petitions, with a foundation in the First Amendment[footnote]U.S. Const. amend. I (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d).[\/footnote] and Administrative Procedure Act,[footnote]5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0553(e) (2012) (requiring government agencies to provide the public with \u201cthe right to petition for issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule\u201d).[\/footnote] in theory play an important role in ensuring that drugs are safe and effective. In practice, however, brand firms have used peti\u00adtions to delay generic approval, extending monopolies on their products at a potential cost to consumers of millions of dollars per day. In many cases, petitions offer little incremental value to the review process but require considera\u00adble time, with the FDA forced to address the merits of every petition, many of which contain \u201cdetailed analysis and precise scien\u00adtific doc\u00adumentation\u201d and require review by \u201cmultiple disciplines\u201d within the agency.[footnote]The Generic Drug Maze: Speeding Access to Affordable, Life-Saving Drugs: Hearing Before the S. Spec. Comm. on Aging, 109th Cong. 14 (2006) (statement of Gary Buehler, Director, Office of Generic Drugs, FDA).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOne type of petition has caused particular concern.

In its annual reports to Congress, the FDA has found \u201cdelayed approvals\u201d on only ten occasions between 2008 and 2015.[footnote]FY 2015 Report, supra note 26, at 8.[\/footnote] The agency, however, does not specify these petitions, nor does it consider a petition delayed if it responds within the 150-day period.[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 9 (finding that \u201ca petition answered within the [150-day] statutory deadline does not delay approval of a pending application\u201d).[\/footnote] Relatedly, the FDA has failed to consider that it could be delaying generic approval by not approving the generic until it resolves the petition.[footnote]See infra Part III.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCongress attempted to address concerns presented by citizen peti\u00adtions in the FDAAA.[footnote]See supra notes 11\u201316 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] It allowed the FDA to delay its approval of a ge\u00adneric only if the delay was \u201cnecessary to protect the public health.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(A)(i) (2012).[\/footnote] And it required that the agency provide certain types of information to Congress each year.[footnote]See infra note 39 and accompanying text (listing requirements of annual reports submitted to Congress). [\/footnote] But this legislation was not successful in its goal of \u201cstop[ping] frivolous petitions from delaying generic entry,\u201d[footnote]153 Cong. Rec. 10,924 (2007) (statement of Sen. Debbie Stabenow).[\/footnote] as the num\u00adber of petitions increased after the law went into effect and has shown no signs of abating.[footnote]See Michael A. Carrier &amp; Daryl Wander, Citizen Petitions: An Empirical Study, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 249, 282 (2012).[\/footnote] This Piece picks up where the FDAAA left off, proposing five solutions to the citizen petition problem: (1) increasing transparency; (2) shedding light on simultaneous decisions on peti\u00adtions and generic approval; (3) facilitating the FDA\u2019s summary disposi\u00adtions of petitions; (4) addressing resource waste; and (5) promoting timely filed petitions.\r\n<h2>II. Enhance Transparency<\/h2>\r\nThe first proposal would increase transparency. The FDA currently is required to provide annual reports to Congress that specify certain types of information:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of applications that were approved during the preceding 12-month period\u201d;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of such applications whose effective dates were delayed by [the above-referenced] petitions\u201d;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of days by which such applications were so delayed\u201d; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\u201c[T]he number of such petitions that were submitted during such period.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(3).[\/footnote]<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nDespite this information, the FDA never explains which petitions it believes have resulted in delay. And again, the agency considers a petition to be delayed only if it does not respond within the 150-day period.[footnote]Supra note 32.[\/footnote] It is possible, however, that a petition leads to delayed entry even within the 150-day period. The FDA, for example, might approve a generic later than it would have if the petition had not been filed. For these reasons, Congress should require the FDA to specify additional categories of information, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Every 505(q) petition;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The timing of the petition in relation to the expiration date of patents listed in the Orange Book[footnote]The Orange Book is an annual compilation of drugs and their associated patents. FDA, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (37th ed. 2017), http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/downloads\/Drugs\/DevelopmentApprovalProcess\/pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/A663-TYBX].[\/footnote] for the brand drug referenced by the generic application;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The time the FDA expended on the petition; and<\/li>\r\n\t<li>The delay (if any) in generic approval caused by the petition and determination of how the delay is calculated.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThe FDA can provide this information in its annual report to Congress or on its website (like it does for patents listed in the Orange Book, generic applications, and products requiring Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)[footnote]REMS, which often take the form of restrictions on a drug\u2019s distribution, ensure that a drug\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355-1(a)(1).[\/footnote]). Each of the categories would address certain current deficiencies. By providing a list of every 505(q) petition, the FDA would make it significantly easier to research and analyze peti\u00adtions. Including information on when the petitions were filed would high\u00adlight late filings in relation to patents. The third category would, as discussed in more detail below,[footnote]See infra Part V (discussing the FDA\u2019s time and cost expenditure on each petition).[\/footnote] shed light on FDA resources expended on petitions. And the fourth category would provide more useful infor\u00admation than is currently available on delay from petitions.\r\n\r\nIn short, these additional categories would provide valuable infor\u00admation that is currently missing and would highlight the significant con\u00adcerns presented by citizen petitions.\r\n<h2>III. Elucidate Simultaneous Resolutions<\/h2>\r\nA second proposal targets a particular instance of transparency, which involves simultaneous determinations. On certain occasions, the FDA denies a citizen petition at the same time it grants generic approval. Some of these decisions occur within a short time (for example, one month) of each other while others occur on the same day. Although the FDA has never acknowledged doing so, industry observers have com\u00admented that the agency\u2019s \u201cpractice for many years has been to simultane\u00adously announce both decisions.\u201d[footnote]Kurt R. Karst et al., How FDA Announces Drug Approval Decisions: A Broken FDA \u201cSystem\u201d that Must Be Fixed, FDA Law Blog 1, http:\/\/www.fdalawblog.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/archives\/docs\/Drug%20Approval%20Decision%20Paper.pdf [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/QF4E-UCM7] (last visited Jan. 31, 2018).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe FDA\u2019s control over the timing of decisions relating to petitions and generic approval has been criticized, with one court lamenting the \u201cmess\u201d that prevented \u201cthe opportunity to actually review the FDA\u2019s actual decision and actual reasoning\u201d on the citizen petition before the agency reached a decision on the generic application.[footnote]Id. at 5 (citing AstraZeneca Pharms. LP v. Burwell, 197 F. Supp. 3d 53 (D.D.C. 2016)); cf. id. at 3\u20134 (citing Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co. v. FDA, 587 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2008)) (expressing \u201cconcern that FDA would be making a decision on exclusivity without either company having the ability to challenge that decision before facing irreparable harm\u201d).[\/footnote] An industry ex\u00adpert concluded that \u201cthe current FDA system to announce\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. hotly con\u00adtested decisions is broken,\u201d with \u201cwhatever advantage\u201d the agency \u201cmay think it is getting from hiding the ball from the world on the timing and substance of these decisions\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. more than overcome by the criticism the Agency has received from judges.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 8.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nWhen the FDA issues simultaneous rulings, one concern is that the generic would have been approved <em>earlier<\/em> absent the petition. As dis\u00adcussed above, petitions often require multiple divisions of the FDA to review detailed documentation, slowing down the approval process.[footnote]See supra note 10 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] But as long as the decision is reached within 150 days, the FDA does not count these as instances of delay in its annual report.[footnote]See supra note 32 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] For example, the FDA asserts that there is no delay when the 150-day period ends before the generic is \u201cready for approval,\u201d without considering whether the peti\u00adtion itself <em>delayed<\/em> approval.[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 9.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis position seems inconsistent with the agency\u2019s guidance. In determining whether a petition would delay a generic application (which is allowed only to protect health),[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(A) (2012).[\/footnote] it applies a \u201cbut for\u201d test to deter\u00admine delay that asks if the generic would be \u201cready for approval but for the issues raised by the petition.\u201d[footnote]Guidance for Industry, supra note 13, at 8.[\/footnote] Given the information currently available to the public, it is not possible for observers to determine this. Applying its \u201cbut for\u201d analysis, the agency should make clear when it was likely to have approved the generic absent the petition.\r\n\r\nA second concern is that the FDA delays announcing a petition deci\u00adsion it has <em>already reached<\/em> until it formally approves the generic applica\u00adtion. In this scenario, the petition does not delay the generic, but the FDA delays the <em>announcement<\/em> of the petition\u2019s denial so that it is made simultaneously with the generic\u2019s approval. The FDA may engage in this conduct to eliminate the possibility of judicial review of the petition decision.\r\n\r\nThe FDA has demonstrated concern that rulings on petitions \u201cconsti\u00adtute final Agency action and are subject to immediate review by the courts.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 14; see also Amendments to Regulations on Citizen Petitions, Petitions for Stay of Action, and Submission of Documents to Dockets, 81 Fed. Reg. 78,500, 78,504 (Nov. 8, 2016) (\u201cFDA is considered to have taken final Agency action on a petition if either: (1) FDA makes a final decision\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. during the 150-day period or (2) the 150-day period expires without FDA making a final decision.\u201d).[\/footnote] As a result, petition rulings \u201ccarry with them none of the procedural rights\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that attach to a decision to deny\u201d generic approval.[footnote]Guidance for Industry, supra note 13, at 14 (explaining how, after the FDA denies an application for approval, it \u201cmust give the applicant notice of an opportunity for a hearing on whether the application is approvable, with a specific timeframe and process\u201d).[\/footnote] Rulings on petitions before decisions on generic approval thus \u201ccould interfere with the statutory and regulatory scheme governing the review of applications and related procedural rights of applicants.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMore skeptically, the FDA may be delaying petition rulings so that it is less likely to be sued in court. A petition denied before generic approval may be appealed to the courts, but one announced simultane\u00adously with the approval decision is less likely to be challenged since in that case the generic has received approval and may be on the market shortly thereafter, which would dissuade a brand firm seeking to keep a generic off the market.\r\n\r\nShedding light on the timing of simultaneous decisions\u2014including determinations of (1) when the generic would have received approval absent the petition and (2) when the FDA would have announced the petition decision absent the pending generic application\u2014would help resolve these contentious issues.\r\n<h2>IV. Facilitate Summary Disposition<\/h2>\r\nThird, Congress could make it easier for the FDA to quickly dispose of certain petitions. Because the legislature understood that some peti\u00adtions raised significant concern, it allowed the FDA to summarily dispense with them. This authority, however, has never been used.[footnote]See Sarah Zhang, How Pharma Companies Use \u2018Citizen Petitions\u2019 to Keep Drug Prices High, Atlantic (Mar. 8, 2017), http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2017\/\r\n03\/pharma-citizen-petitions-drug-prices\/518544\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/735VG7QM] (\u201c[T]he FDA can summarily deny petitions that it finds frivolous\u2014but it never has.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the standard is too high. Section 505(q)(1)(E) requires the FDA to conclude that a petition is \u201csubmitted with the pri\u00admary purpose of delaying\u201d the generic application and that \u201cthe petition does not on its face raise valid scientific or regulatory issues.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(E) (2012).[\/footnote] But the provi\u00adsion \u201chas neither curbed the filing of petitions submitted with the primary purpose of delay\u201d nor \u201cpermitted FDA to dispose of such peti\u00adtions without expending substantial amounts of resources.\u201d[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 10.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAs the agency has explained, the standards for summary disposition are \u201cextremely difficult to meet.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] For starters, the FDA cannot deter\u00admine a petitioner\u2019s primary purpose based on the petition itself. Merely reviewing such a document, which includes safety or effectiveness con\u00adcerns, cannot reveal the filer\u2019s purpose, let alone its primary purpose.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even a petition that ultimately is denied will tend not to reveal \u201con its face\u201d that it \u201cdoes not\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. raise valid scientific or regulatory issues.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(E).[\/footnote] Petitions will include language and sometimes documentation challenging a drug\u2019s safety or efficacy that at first glance may sound plausi\u00adble. The FDA would be hesitant to rule in a cursory review that the petition does not raise valid issues. Its concern is obvious: that errone\u00adously granted summary dispositions result in safety mishaps years down the road.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done? First, remove the two conditions. The FDA can\u00adnot determine purpose from the petition itself, nor can it dismiss peti\u00adtions raising safety or effectiveness concerns based on a document\u2019s \u201cface.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn place of these requirements, the agency could focus on timing. Legitimate petitions should be filed within a reasonably short time of dis\u00adcovering the safety or efficacy concern. Late-filed petitions raise the con\u00adcern that the petitioner is gaming the system, often by waiting until a generic is about to enter the market to file even though it was long aware of the information forming the basis of the petition.\r\n\r\nAs one example, Mylan received widespread notoriety for its price in\u00adcreases on the life-saving epinephrine-autoinjector EpiPen device.[footnote]See Willingham, supra note 2. [\/footnote] Not receiving as much attention was Mylan\u2019s filing of a petition challeng\u00ading Teva\u2019s EpiPen alternative at least five years after it most likely was aware of the generic product specifications.[footnote]See Carrier &amp; Minniti, How Mylan Hiked Prices, supra note 22, at 65; see also infra notes 69\u201374 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nCongress could consider replacing Section 505(q)(1)(E) with lan\u00adguage emphasizing the filing of petitions within a reasonable time, with one year providing sufficient time to prepare a petition. One poten\u00adtial statutory amendment (which includes a waiver for unusual circum\u00adstances[footnote]One such circumstance could include the situation in which (1) a new study shows that a molecule is harmful in population X; (2) two years later, a different study shows that the molecule may also be harmful in population Y, which is similar to population X; and (3) a petition is then filed asserting that a generic should not be approved for treating population Y. It is arguable that a petition should have been filed two years earlier due to the similarities between populations X and Y. Allowing a waiver eliminates any ambiguity that could be used to reject the petition based on late filing.[\/footnote]) could provide:\r\n\r\n505(q) petitions must be filed within one year of the petitioner learning of the safety or efficacy issue asserted in the petition. FDA may grant a waiver to allow later filing.\r\n\r\nSuch an amendment would make it more difficult to file questiona\u00adble petitions. And by focusing on the delay in filing, the analysis would pinpoint concerns based on timing, which raise red flags and can be dis\u00adcerned, rather than the filer\u2019s purpose or problems on the peti\u00adtion\u2019s face, which cannot readily be determined.[footnote]If challenged, the proposal should survive First Amendment scrutiny as a content-neutral restriction that (1) does not completely block petitioning and (2) serves an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression in (a) solving a public health problem of consumers paying unwarranted monopoly prices from abusive petitions and (b) addressing the failure of prior efforts by the FDA and Congress to remedy the problem. See United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968); see also supra notes 26\u201328 and 34\u201338 and accompanying text (discussing previous failures to find a solution). Previous widely acknowledged failures to solve the problem show that the recommendation \u201cpromotes a substantial government interest\u201d that would otherwise \u201cbe achieved less effectively.\u201d See United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689 (1985).[\/footnote]\r\n<h2>V. Address Resource Waste<\/h2>\r\nA fourth proposal would require the FDA to disclose the money and time it expends resolving 505(q) petitions. In its Eighth Report to Congress, the FDA was \u201cconcerned about the resources required to respond to 505(q) petitions within the 150-day deadline at the expense of completing [its] other work.\u201d[footnote]FY 2015 Report, supra note 26, at 8.[\/footnote] And in its Seventh Report, it explained that the reduction from 180 to 150 days \u201cincreased the strain on Agency resources,\u201d which required it \u201cto direct resources away from other important initiatives to attempt to comply with the new shorter deadline.\u201d[footnote]FY 2014 Report, supra note 27, at 10.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nPutting dollar and time figures on the resource drain from petition responses could offer important benefits. It would make the problems posed by citizen petitions more concrete and provide greater impetus for changes. As it stands now, the theoretical arguments based on freedom of expression and the possibility of raising legitimate concerns with the FDA, combined with inertia and the difficulty of limiting existing proce\u00addures, make it more difficult to impose limits on the process. Concrete figures depicting the resources expended on petitions, when considered in the setting of the overwhelming incidence of denials,[footnote]See supra note 18 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] could pave the way for changes.\r\n<h2>VI. Promote Timeliness<\/h2>\r\nFifth, Congress could amend section 505(q)(1)(H) to require a peti\u00adtioner to certify that it filed its objection within a reasonable time\u2014say, one year\u2014of discovering the claim that is the basis of the petition. Currently, the section requires the petitioner to certify that the petition includes \u201call information and views upon which the petition relies\u201d and \u201crepresentative data and\/or information known to the petitioner which are unfavorable to the petition,\u201d and that it took \u201creasonable steps to ensure that any representative data and\/or information which are unfavor\u00adable to the petition were disclosed.\u201d[footnote]21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0355(q)(1)(H) (2012).[\/footnote] The petitioner is also re\u00adquired to \u201ccertify that the information upon which\u201d the action requested is based \u201cfirst became known\u201d on a date the party specifies.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAlthough it would appear that these requirements would result in peti\u00adtions that are timely filed, that is not always the case. Petitioners sometimes file long after becoming aware of the basis for the petition. One example appears with Mylan\u2019s citizen petition against Teva\u2019s Epi-Pen alternative, filed on January 16, 2015.[footnote]Citizen Petition from Mylan Specialty, L.P., No. FDA-2015-P-0181-0001 at 1 (posted Jan. 20, 2015); see also Carrier &amp; Minniti, How Mylan Hiked Prices, supra note 22, at 64.[\/footnote] In a development of which the industry would be keenly aware, Teva filed its ANDA against the Epi-Pen in 2008.[footnote]Larry Smith, <em>The Promise of the Antares Pipeline is the Basis of My Buy Recommendation<\/em>, Smith On Stocks (Jan. 25, 2012), http:\/\/smithonstocks.com\/the-promise-of-the-antares-pipeline-is-the-basis-of-my-buy-recommendation-ais-2-40 [http:\/\/\r\nperma.cc\/4UJE-8B8B].[\/footnote] And court documents show that Teva produced its ANDA filing in the course of litigation on September 17, 2010.[footnote]Defendants\u2019 Brief in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss at 6, King Pharm., Inc. v. Teva Parenteral Meds. Inc., No. 09-CV-652-GMS (D. Del. filed Dec. 13, 2010), 2010 WL 7583650.[\/footnote] This material included \u201cdetailed product descriptions, drawings, and instructions for use\u201d for Teva\u2019s proposed generic.[footnote]Id.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nAt the time (and to this day), Mylan (as distributor and marketer) was working hand-in-hand with Meridian\/King (manufacturer), with the former taking over Orange Book sponsorship of the drug application and the latter targeting rivals in litigation.[footnote]Complaint at 2, King Pharm., Inc. v. Teva Parenteral Meds. Inc., No. 09-CV652-GMS (D. Del. filed Aug. 28, 2009), 2009 WL 2849496.[\/footnote] It thus seems exceedingly likely that Mylan would have been aware of Teva\u2019s ANDA in 2008 and aware of documents explaining Teva\u2019s product in 2010. In fact, it was <em>Mylan<\/em> that announced the settlement of the litigation, confirming its close connection to the case.[footnote]<em>See Mylan and Pfizer Announce Epinephrine Auto-injector Settlement Agreement with Teva<\/em>, Mylan (Apr. 26, 2012), http:\/\/newsroom.mylan.com\/press-releases?item=123144 [http:\/\/perma.cc\/V7EX-T49J].[\/footnote] This connection raises significant con\u00adcerns that Mylan waited more than four years to file its citizen petition in 2015.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to section 505(q)(1)(H) to require a petitioner to certify that it filed its objection within one year of discovering the claim underlying the petition would help address the situation. The end of the section could include the following language:\r\n\r\nThe petitioner must certify that it became aware of the infor\u00admation upon which the action requested is based within one year of the petition.\r\n\r\nPutting a timeframe on the obligation could make it more concrete and more difficult to evade. At the same time, one year should be enough time to research potential concerns with the generic drug. A certi\u00adfication requiring filing within one year would make clear that peti\u00adtions cannot be used to delay generic entry.[footnote]For an overview of the First Amendment implications of this proposal, see supra note 63 and accompanying text.[\/footnote]\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nCitizen petitions have recently received attention as a tool by which brand firms have delayed generic entry, allowing them to maintain their monopolies and preventing consumers from enjoying lower prices. The FDA has revealed concern with the resources it expends on petitions and has recently denied nearly all petitions targeting generic entry.\r\n\r\nThe five proposals offered in this Piece would address the most egre\u00adgious aspects of the process. They would increase transparency, allow the dismissal of frivolous petitions, and prevent some of the most flagrant instances of delayed generic entry. Given high drug prices, the five pro\u00adposals are worth attention.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

           Decarbonization is the process of converting our economy from one that runs predominantly on energy derived from fossil fuels to one that runs almost exclusively on clean, carbon-free energy. If pursued on the scale that experts believe necessary to prevent dangerous climate change, the infrastructure changes required to decarbonize the United States will have significant social and cultural implications.

States are joined in the letter by tribes, cities, colleges, universities, businesses, and investors. Id. Nine states have signed as of January 2018. See id.[\/footnote] States are backing up this promise with escalating state laws aimed at \u201cdecarbonization\u201d\u2014that is, the process of ending reliance on energy sources that emit carbon pollution.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nLeading states have passed legislation to reduce carbon emissions in their jurisdictions 80% by 2050, with a focus on reducing carbon pollu\u00adtion from electricity.[footnote]For a catalog of states embracing this goal, see infra note 72 and accompanying text. Decarbonizing electricity is critical because experts predict that global greenhouse gas emissions must approach zero in the coming decades, even though electricity con\u00adsumption is expected to double as transportation electrifies. See 2 James H. Williams et al., Energy &amp; Envtl. Econ., Inc. &amp; Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, Policy Implications of Deep Decarbonization in the United States 4 (2015) [hereinafter Williams et al., Deep Decarbonization Policy], <a href=\"http:\/\/deepdecarbonization.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/US_Deep_Decarbonization_Policy_Report.pdf\">http:\/\/deepdecarbonization.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/\r\nUS_Deep_Decarbonization_Policy_Report.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/T9FD-TD2C] (\u201cLimiting warming to 2\u00b0C or less, an objective agreed upon by the international community, will require that global net [greenhouse gas] emis\u00adsions approach zero by the second half of the 21st century.\u201d); see also William Boyd &amp; Ann E. Carlson, Accidents of Federalism: Ratemaking and Policy Innovation in Public Utility Law, 63 UCLA L. Rev. 810, 812 (2016) (\u201c[D]ecarbonizing the electric power sector is far and away the most important component of any effort to meet ambitious U.S. [green\u00adhouse gas] reduction targets by 2050 and beyond.\u201d). [\/footnote] These are ambitious goals, likely to require the replacement of significant infrastructure at substantial expense.[footnote]See Emily Hammond &amp; Jim Rossi, Stranded Costs and Grid Decarbonization, 82 Brook. L. Rev. 645, 663\u201364 (2017) (noting that decarbonization \u201cstands to be one of the most significant economic transformations the economy has experienced in the last cen\u00adtury\u201d); see also infra note 281.[\/footnote] And yet, in setting policies to achieve these goals, no state has adopted a purely market-based system that aims to reduce emissions at the lowest cost above all other goals.[footnote]See, e.g., Jim Rossi, Carbon Taxation by Regulation, 102 Minn. L. Rev. 277, 298\u201399 (2017) [hereinafter Ross, Carbon Taxation] (noting that various approaches to inter\u00adnal subsidies \u201cfall considerably short of the efficiency and social-welfare benefits that a carbon tax could provide\u201d).[\/footnote] Instead, states have crafted schemes that help them manage the contours, aims, and consequences of decarbonization. These state policies include requirements that utilities buy certain amounts and types of renewable energy, incentives for communities to build their own solar farms, payments to aging (and appealingly carbon-free) nuclear power plants to keep them from retiring, and complete redesign of state electricity law.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] These various policies combine decarbo\u00adnization with aims ranging from job creation and economic development to income redis\u00adtribution, urban revitalization, open-space preservation, and the continu\u00adation of traditional livelihoods.[footnote]See infra sections I.B, II.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a potential downside to this rich set of state climate policies. As state ambitions ramp up, complications with this state-by-state approach to decarbonizing electricity become more apparent. States share jurisdiction over electricity with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).[footnote]See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824(b) (2012) (providing federal jurisdiction over \u201cthe transmis\u00adsion of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at whole\u00adsale in interstate commerce,\u201d but otherwise reserving authority for states). For more detail, see infra Part I.[\/footnote] In most of the country, states have ceded partial control over electricity supply to regional electricity-market operators, which are \u201chybrid\u201d quasi-private, quasi-governmental entities, comprised of industry members functioning under FERC oversight.[footnote]See Hari M. Osofsky &amp; Hannah J. Wiseman, Hybrid Energy Governance, 2014 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1, 6 (describing how \u201cthe tripartite energy system [of physical, regulatory, and market components] involve[s] numerous public and private stakeholders at multiple levels of government\u201d). Electricity-market structures are discussed in sections I.A and III.B.[\/footnote] These electri\u00adcity markets are designed to select least-cost sources of electricity; they do not \u201cprice in\u201d carbon or otherwise favor carbon-free generation sources.[footnote]See infra note 55 and accompanying text (noting that electricity markets are designed for least-cost electricity and are therefore limited in accommodating other goals); see also infra text accompanying note 237 (describing the aims of a carbon-pricing scheme).[\/footnote] Consequently, many allege that state incentives and payment schemes targeted at particular low-carbon technologies inter\u00adfere with the smooth functioning of these regional markets.[footnote]See infra section I.C.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNow, faced with a growing number of divergent state policies, several regional market operators have accepted that electricity markets may need to play a more active role in decarbonization.[footnote]See infra sections I.C, III.A; see also William Boyd, Public Utility and the Low-Carbon Future, 61 UCLA L. Rev. 1614, 1686\u201387 (2014) (\u201cFrom a climate change perspec\u00adtive\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the looming question is whether electricity markets can deliver significant carbon reductions over the next several decades.\u201d).[\/footnote] One key question under discussion is whether it is time to redesign electricity markets to achieve states\u2019 decarbonization goals.[footnote]Many people in this conversation distinguish between two ways that markets could be redesigned to support state climate policies. Markets could either be tweaked to <em>accommodate<\/em> state policies without attempting to supplant them, or markets could be used to <em>achieve<\/em> state climate goals. See Cheryl A. LaFleur, Comm\u2019r, FERC, Remarks at FERC Technical Conference: State Policies and Wholesale Markets Operated by ISO New England Inc., New York Independent System Operator, Inc., and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., at 229\u201330 (May 1, 2017) [hereinafter LaFleur, FERC Technical Conference], <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ferc.gov\/CalendarFiles\/20170530122035-Transcript,%20May%201,%20201\">http:\/\/www.ferc.gov\/CalendarFiles\/20170530122035-Transcript,%20May%201,%20201<\/a>7.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/QNK2-7SZZ] (distinguishing between \u201cachieve\u201d-style solutions, in which markets are redesigned to accomplish state policy goals, and \u201caccommodate\u201d-style solutions, in which markets are adjusted to function around state policy goals); Memorandum from New England States Comm. on Elec. to New England Power Pool 1\u20132 (Apr. 7, 2017) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (discussing NESCOE\u2019s feedback on the \u201clong-term \u2018achieve\u2019-style proposals,\u201d as well as NESCOE\u2019s plan to assess a \u201cshort-term, \u2018accommodate\u2019-style proposal\u201d). This Article focuses on the \u201cachieve\u201d category of solutions, although it briefly touches upon the poten\u00adtial to accommodate state policies.

See Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 46,940, 46,945 (Oct. 10, 2017) (to be codified at 18 C.F.R. pt. 35). For those expressing consternation, see, e.g., Sonal Patel, What States Told FERC About the DOE\u2019s Grid Resiliency Rule, PowerMag (Oct. 25, 2017), http:\/\/www.powermag.com\/what-states-told-ferc-about-the-does-grid-resiliency-rule-infographic [http:\/\/perma.cc\/93ZV-2V5F] (mapping state responses to the DOE\u2019s pro\u00adposal and showing many states in key RTO regions to be \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d); Jeff St. John, DOE\u2019s Coal, Nuclear Cost Recovery Plan Receives Onslaught of Opposition, Greentech Media (Oct. 24, 2017), http:\/\/www.greentechmedia.com\/articles\/read\/doe-coal-nuclear-cost-recovery-opposition-perry#gs.6b25rRU [http:\/\/perma.cc\/MW92-GAHA] (\u201cThe pro\u00adposal has drawn a backlash from major sectors of the energy industry, and the critique of two of three seated FERC commissioners at present, based on the potentially dire impacts it could have on the country\u2019s relatively well-run and low-cost electricity markets.\u201d). Section IV.C discusses the DOE Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) in more detail. For FERC\u2019s response, see infra notes 332\u2013334.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is obvious appeal to using electricity markets to achieve state climate change goals. Integrating these goals into markets could lower the cost of decarbonizing energy, while eliminating the risk that accret\u00ading state policies might distort the functioning of electricity markets. For this reason, many stakeholders that often find themselves on opposite sides of energy policy debates have expressed support for integrating state climate policies into regional electricity markets.[footnote]Of note, several environmental not-for-profits find themselves aligned with fossil fuel generators on this topic. See infra Part III; see also Gavin Bade, The Carbon Consensus: Generators, Analysts Back CO2 Price at FERC Technical Conference, Util. Dive (May 3, 2017), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.utilitydive.com\/news\/the-carbon-consensus-generators-analysts-back-co2-price-at-ferc-technical\/441862\/\">http:\/\/www.utilitydive.com\/news\/the-carbon-consensus-generators-analysts-\r\nback-co2-price-at-ferc-technical\/441862\/<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/4F9N-UWNS] (\u201c[O]ne note\u00adworthy area of consensus emerged from nearly every corner of the diverse stakeholder group\u2014the need to price carbon in wholesale power markets.\u201d).[\/footnote] It can thus feel almost reflexively reactionary for anyone who supports rapid decarboni\u00adzation to resist such efforts.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this Article argues that states should exercise caution in ceding control over decarbonization too quickly or thoroughly to regional electricity markets. This argument is grounded in comparative institu\u00adtional competencies[footnote]See Neil K. Komesar, Imperfect Alternatives: Choosing Institutions in Law, Economics, and Public Policy 4\u20136 (1994) (arguing that \u201cdeciding who decides\u201d is a critical part of legal analysis and calling for greater attention to comparative institutional analysis).[\/footnote] and the importance of preserving state cen\u00adtrality in decisionmaking over decarbonization.[footnote]\u201cState\u201d in this context refers to government. This Article does not intend to make a federalism argument, but rather proceeds on the assumption that states will be the level of government that primarily addresses decarbonization for the next several years. See Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 278 (describing federal carbon tax legislation as \u201cinfeasible and\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. stalled, at least for the foreseeable future\u201d); see also infra section IV.D.[\/footnote] In short, states do a dis\u00adservice to current and future residents if they cede the shape of decarbonization policy to market insiders and experts rather than subject these policy decisions to wider democratic inquiry, debate, and decisionmaking.\r\n\r\nAlthough conversations about electricity markets and decarboniza\u00adtion can quickly alienate all but the most technocratic insiders, decarbon\u00adization is far more than a technical project. Decarbonization policies will determine how our society extracts, owns, sites, manages, moves, consumes, and conserves electricity in the future. Given electric\u00adity\u2019s centrality to modern life, such policies have the potential to radically alter political and economic power, as well as to shape the future of American land\u00adscapes, communities, and daily living arrangements.[footnote]See infra section II.A.[\/footnote] Decarbonization is thus a profoundly social project.[footnote]This point is well made outside the legal literature, see infra note 147, but its implications for climate law and policy are surprisingly undertheorized. In a forthcoming article, Professor Alice Kaswan explores how decarbonization\u2019s society-wide impacts might inform our understanding of the drawbacks of market-based mechanisms more generally, but she does not address the proposal to use regional electricity markets in particular. See Alice Kaswan, Energy, Governance, and Market Mechanisms, 72 Miami L. Rev. (forthcoming 2018) (manuscript at 1\u201311) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn crafting multifaceted, nuanced decarbonization policies, states are demonstrating their understanding of this fact. State climate policies reflect state preferences about <em>how <\/em>they decarbonize, instead of just <em>whether <\/em>they decarbonize. These diverse public preferences would be lost in the integration of state policy aims into regional electricity markets. This Article identifies three particular risks electricity markets present in this regard. The first is the loss of transparent, government-driven deci\u00adsionmaking on the trajectory of decarbonization. Electricity markets are governed through quasi-private, immensely technocratic, and largely opaque processes[footnote]See infra section III.A.[\/footnote]\u2014hardly the space in which we should center debates over the shape of decarbonization. The second risk is one of homogeni\u00adzation to the lowest common denominator. Electricity-market design lim\u00adits the tools with which states can respond to decarbonization, requiring states to homogenize their preferences. In practice, such homogeniza\u00adtion is likely to water down more ambitious state policies to achieve the near-consensus buy-in of states and stakeholders required in regional electricity-market governance.\r\n\r\nThe final risk to electricity-market integration of state climate poli\u00adcies stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2016 decision in <em>Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC<\/em>.[footnote]136 S. Ct. 1288 (2016).[\/footnote] There, the Supreme Court placed limits on states\u2019 abilities to adopt policies that regulate electricity in ways too closely linked to federally overseen markets.[footnote]Id. at 1299.[\/footnote] Although <em>Hughes <\/em>left open significant questions regarding how much overlap there can be between regional-market functions and state policy aims, it creates legal risk around any state decision to cede decarbonization goals to the markets.[footnote]See infra section III.B.[\/footnote] Once a state gives control over a particular function\u2014like decarboniza\u00adtion\u2014to its regional market, it may diminish the set of tools that it can use at the state level to accomplish the same policy aim.\r\n\r\nArticulating these reasons for caution does not mean that states should resist all efforts to integrate decarbonization aims into regional electricity markets. Instead, these risks point to a series of conclusions about when market integration of state climate policies is advisable and how it might best proceed. First, states might prefer using regional elec\u00adtricity markets as a climate tool when their objective is the cheapest decar\u00adbonization possible, without regard for what resources the market selects or where these resources are located. In contrast, if a state has resource preferences, distributional goals, or other objectives related to <em>how <\/em>decar\u00adbonization proceeds, markets will prove inapt tools. For these states, market integration may prove advisable only if the particular mar\u00adket reform selected allows states leeway to adjust their preferences and factor them into the market design.[footnote]Part IV explains how certain market reforms might allow for this more easily than others.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, the regional politics of decarbonization should inform state decisions. U.S. states diverge considerably in the ambition of their climate policies, from states pledging to go \u201c100% renewable\u201d to states focused on perpetuating U.S. coal consumption.[footnote]For a catalog of some of the most ambitious state renewable energy targets, see generally infra notes 87\u201388.

The greater the likelihood of such persuasion suc\u00adceeding, the more appealing a market-based solution should be.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFinally, the appeal of integrating state policies into regional markets might shift over time as courts flesh out the boundaries of the <em>Hughes<\/em> deci\u00adsion and related cases.[footnote]See infra section III.C.[\/footnote] Because of these variables at play, the ques\u00adtion of how to manage the intersection of state policies and regional electricity markets is likely to be a dynamic and region-specific one. Nevertheless, there is value in understanding at the outset of these conversations the risks that the marketization of state climate policies presents to the multi\u00adfaceted project of decarbonization. Only states ready to relinquish control over their decarbonization trajectory in exchange for cost effectiveness should embrace market integration proposals as they stand now.\r\n\r\nMost scholarly analysis of these proposed electricity-market reforms has focused on the jurisdictional questions they present. Regional elec\u00adtricity-market operators are constrained by the Federal Power Act\u2019s man\u00addate that federally overseen markets ensure \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates.[footnote]See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824d (2012).[\/footnote] Whether integrating decarbonization goals falls within this mandate is a thorny legal question, and many prominent energy law scholars are puz\u00adzling through this jurisdictional morass.[footnote]See 2 Steven Weissman &amp; Romany Webb, Berkeley Ctr. for Law, Energy &amp; the Env\u2019t, Addressing Climate Change Without Legislation: FERC \u00a7\u00a03.1 (2014), http:\/\/\r\nwww.law.berkeley.edu\/files\/CLEE\/FERC_Report_FINAL.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/5XE7-R4Q7] (\u201cIn addition to considering . . . supplier and customer interests, FERC\u2019s rate\u00admaking must also protect the general public interest.\u201d); Christopher J.

Often, energy law scholars approach such questions over state versus regional market con\u00adtrol through the lens of federalism\u2014asking whether FERC or the states are better positioned to take the lead.[footnote]See, e.g., Boyd &amp; Carlson, supra note 6, at 812\u201320; Felix Mormann, Clean Energy Federalism, 67 Fla. L. Rev. 1621, 1625\u201330 (2015); Jim Rossi, The Brave New Path of Energy Federalism, 95 Tex. L. Rev. 399, 403 (2016) [hereinafter Rossi, Brave New Path].[\/footnote] This Article frames these debates differently, highlighting the ways in which they implicate long-standing institutional design choices between complex, heavily managed market constructs and more direct regulatory control by states.[footnote]Professor William Boyd began an evocative exploration of these themes in <em>Public Utility and the Low-Carbon Future<\/em>, in which he argues that electricity markets are part of \u201ca broader understanding of public utility\u201d and should be harnessed to normative ends. Boyd, supra note 15, at 1673. Boyd\u2019s analysis frames but does not answer the question tack\u00adled here\u2014how, within this normative project, states should weigh the relative merits of using markets or regulation to accomplish their decarbonizing aims. Professor Jim Rossi has similarly reframed the conversation by identifying ways in which state decarbonization policies resemble \u201ccarbon taxation by regulation.\u201d See Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 279\u201380. Rossi\u2019s focus, however, is on how these regulatory instruments can be made to resemble market mechanisms\u2014a line of inquiry that deviates substantially from my own. See id.; see also infra note 170. Professor David B. Spence also has insightful broader work on these themes. See generally David B. Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets, 92 Notre Dame L. Rev. 973 (2017) [hereinafter, Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets] (explaining how \u201cenergy markets can never resemble the idealized markets of economic theory that have become so popular in conservative policy discourse\u201d).[\/footnote] Framing the issue in this way lends relevance to a separate genre of scholarship, focused on questions of how markets, public policy, and values inter\u00adsect.[footnote]See infra Part II. See generally Frank Ackerman &amp; Lisa Heinzerling, Priceless: On Knowing the Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing (2005) (criticizing the assign\u00adment of monetary values to public health and environmental resources); Douglas A. Kysar, Regulating from Nowhere: Environmental Law and the Search for Objectivity (2010) (arguing against a utilitarian, welfare-maximization approach to environmental policy in favor of an approach that is more morally accountable); Mark Sagoff, The Economy of the Earth: Philosophy, Law, and the Environment (2d ed. 2008) (describing two conceptions of the environment\u2014as intrinsically sacrosanct and as a source of economic value\u2014and arguing that society must balance the two conceptions); Michael J.

Decarbonization might radically redistribute wealth and power in U.S. society, or it might largely maintain the status quo while shifting only behind-the-scenes fuel choices.[footnote]See infra section II.A.[\/footnote] State policies reflect and embody this contest while regional markets present a homog\u00adenizing and privatizing force that narrows the room in which to debate the many shapes a decarbonized society might take.\r\n\r\nThis Article proceeds in four parts. Part I gives an overview of regional electricity markets, state climate change policies, and their inter\u00adsections. Part II explores the nature of the project of decarbonization, illus\u00adtrating how state climate policies embody diverse preferences and values that reflect an understanding of the significant choices at hand. Part III shows how electricity-market redesign might eliminate these democrat\u00adically determined value choices embedded in state climate poli\u00adcies, laying out the challenges that result from using the peculiar governance structures of electricity markets to carry out decarbonization. Part IV presents lessons derived from this analysis for when states might pre\u00adfer or resist market integration of their decarbonization goals.\r\n<h2>I. The Current Mesh and Clash of Regional Electricity Markets and State Climate Policies<\/h2>\r\nTo understand the debates about decarbonization roiling electricity regulation, one has to begin with a foundation in the structure of elec\u00adtricity policy and electricity markets. This Part provides an overview of regional electricity markets, state climate policies, and their potentially troubling intersections.\r\n<h3>A. Electricity Markets<\/h3>\r\nElectricity governance in the United States is a patchwork affair, tak\u00ading on various forms across states and regions that defy quick summa\u00adtion.[footnote]Cf. Paul L. Joskow, Markets for Power in the United States: An Interim Assessment, 27 Energy J. 1, 4 (2006) (describing U.S. restructuring as occurring without \u201ca clear coherent blueprint,\u201d unlike in other countries).[\/footnote] This patchwork quality stems from the Federal Power Act of 1935, which divides jurisdiction over electricity in the United States. The fed\u00aderal government\u2014acting via FERC\u2014has jurisdiction over \u201cthe sale of [electric] energy at wholesale,\u201d which comprises sales from electricity generators to the utilities that own the transmission and distribution grid that carries that electricity to end-use consumers.[footnote]16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824(a), (b)(1) (2012).[\/footnote] States retain control over \u201cretail sales\u201d of electricity\u2014sales that these utilities make to consumers.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a0824(b)(1).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFrom 1935 until the 1990s, FERC had a fairly straightforward role in electricity regulation. Most utilities owned their own generation resources that they used to supply their retail customers, such that there were rela\u00adtively few \u201cwholesale transactions\u201d of electricity to regulate.[footnote]Paul L. Joskow, Regulatory Failure, Regulatory Reform, and Structural Change in the Electrical Power Industry, 1989 Brookings Papers on Econ. Activity: Microeconomics 125, 134; see also Boyd &amp; Carlson, supra note 6, at 824; David B. Spence, Can Law Manage Competitive Energy Markets?, 93 Cornell L. Rev. 765, 769\u201370 (2008) [hereinafter Spence, Can Law Manage?].[\/footnote] In cases in which one utility sold wholesale power to another, FERC fulfilled its duty to ensure \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates[footnote]See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824a-3(b)(1).[\/footnote] by requiring utilities to prefile the rates they intended to charge for FERC-jurisdictional sales.[footnote]See id. \u00a7\u00a0824d(c) (requiring such filings); W. Deptford Energy v. FERC, 766 F.3d 10, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (\u201cThe Federal Power Act requires regulated utilities to file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as a matter of open and accessible public record, any rates and charges they intend to impose for sales of electrical energy that are subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d (citing 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824d(c))).[\/footnote] At the same time, states had their own public utility commissions (PUCs) to regulate the rates that utilities could charge end-use customers.[footnote]See Boyd &amp; Carlson, supra note 6, at 822\u201323.[\/footnote] Thus, there was relatively little difference in the <em>character <\/em>of regulation at the state and federal levels\u2014in either case, commissions oversaw regu\u00adlated monopoly entities.\r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, Congress and FERC\u2014following on the heels of deregu\u00adlation in other major sectors, including airlines, trucking, communica\u00adtions, and railroads\u2014took significant steps to promote market constructs within federal electricity regulation.[footnote]See Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L.

Kelliher &amp; Maria Farinella, The Changing Landscape of Federal Energy Law, 61 Admin. L. Rev. 611, 613 (2009) (\u201c[The] Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act have changed from a regulatory scheme that controlled market power exercise by utilities, pipelines, and producers through classic rate regulation to a regula\u00adtory regime that controls the exercise of market power through reliance on a mixture of competition and regulation.\u201d); Spence, Can Law Manage?, supra note 43, at 765 (\u201cOver the last three decades, the world\u2019s industrialized democracies have introduced competi\u00adtion into previously noncompetitive, regulated markets.\u201d).[\/footnote] The first move in this direction was a requirement that utilities allow other utilities to utilize their transmis\u00adsion lines at nondiscriminatory rates.[footnote]See Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540, 21,603 (Apr. 24, 1996) (codified at 18 C.F.R. pt. 35) (\u201c[I]f a transmission provider offers a rate discount to its affiliate, or if the transmission provider attributes a discounted rate to its own trans\u00adactions, the same discounted rate must also be offered at the same time to non-affiliates on the same transmission path and on all unconstrained transmission paths.\u201d); Open Access Same-Time Information System (Formerly Real-Time Information Networks) and Standards of Conduct, 61 Fed.

Michaels, The Governance of Transmission Operators, 20 Energy L.J. 233, 236 (1999) (describing the regulatory actions taken by FERC in the late 1990s).[\/footnote] With these two changes in place, the stage was set for the birth of electricity markets\u2014exchanges in which generators could bid in offers to sell electricity and utilities could seek out the low\u00adest-priced sources of electricity to supply their customers.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, FERC issued Order 2000, which encouraged\u2014but did not require\u2014states and utilities to form regional electricity-management organizations, called either \u201cRegional Transmission Organizations\u201d (RTOs) or \u201cIndependent System Operators\u201d (ISOs).[footnote]There is no functional difference between RTOs and ISOs for the purposes of this Article, and this Article refers to all such entities as RTOs hereinafter. See Regional Transmission Organizations, 65 Fed.

In these regions, generators can sell power either through bilateral contracts or through centralized electricity mar\u00adkets administered by RTOs.[footnote]See Emily Hammond &amp; David B. Spence, The Regulatory Contract in the Marketplace, 69 Vand. L. Rev. 141, 154 (2016). Markets for electricity operate on both a day-ahead and a real-time basis, with the latter market making up for any imbalances in supply and demand that occur close to the time of electricity delivery. Id. Bilateral con\u00adtracting continues to make up a sizeable portion of electricity sales even in RTO regions. See, e.g., Collin Cain &amp; Jonathan Lesser, Bates White Econ.

Twenty-nine states currently have an RPS in place.[footnote]Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies, Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency, N.C. Clean Energy Tech. Ctr. (2017) [hereinafter Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies], <a href=\"http:\/\/ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Renewable-Portfolio-Standards.pdf\">http:\/\/ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/\r\n2017\/03\/Renewable-Portfolio-Standards.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6ZMN-GZEE].[\/footnote] These laws require[footnote]Eight additional states have renewable portfolio \u201cgoals\u201d but not requirements. Id.[\/footnote] utilities in the state to source a certain percentage of the electricity that they sell from renew\u00adable sources by a certain date.[footnote]Mormann, supra note 36, at 1624. In some cases, state law specifies an absolute quantity. See, e.g., Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies, supra note 81 (showing Texas with an RPS of 5,880 megawatts by 2015).[\/footnote] This approach enables utilities to seek out the cheapest renewable energy available to satisfy the state mandate.[footnote]Lincoln L. Davies, Power Forward: The Argument for a National RPS, 42 Conn. L. Rev. 1339, 1357 (2010) [hereinafter Davies, Power Forward].[\/footnote] Typically, states track compliance with their RPS by issuing \u201cRenewable Energy Credits\u201d (RECs) to renewable energy generators, which utilities then purchase to prove that the requisite share of their energy has come from renewable sources.[footnote]Id. at 1359\u201360; see also Todd Jones et al., Ctr. for Res. Sols., The Legal Basis for Renewable Energy Certificates 3 (2015) (\u201cThirty-six (36) U.S. states and territories recog\u00adnize that RECs can be used to track and transact renewable electricity on the grid.\u201d). REC trading is often limited to either in-state or in-region. Cf. Robin Kundis Craig, Constitutional Contours for the Design and Implementation of Multistate Renewable Energy Programs and Projects, 81 U. Colo. L. Rev. 771, 795 (2010) (\u201c[A]t the state level, RPS requirements that favor instate RECs or forbid out-of-state RECs could run afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause. Similarly, multistate agreements that allow REC trading within the consortium but prohibit RECs from other states could raise constitutional concerns.\u201d).[\/footnote] RECs thus help create a more liquid market for renewable energy by allowing the \u201crenewable\u201d attribute to be sold separately from the underlying energy.[footnote]Joel H. Mack et al., All RECs Are Local: How In-State Generation Requirements Adversely Affect Development of a Robust REC Market, Elec. J., May 2011, at 8, 10; see also Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 92\u201393 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining RECs); Kelly Crandall, Comment, Trust and the Green Consumer: The Fight for Accountability in Renewable Energy Credits, 81 U. Colo. L. Rev. 893, 904 (2010) (same). FERC has explicitly endorsed the existence of RECs as creations of state law that can legally exist apart from the underlying electricity bought and sold. See WSPP Inc., 139 FERC \u00b6 61,061 (Apr. 20, 2012), 2012 WL 1395532, at *5.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn the most ambitious states, RPSs require a substantial percentage of renewables: In New York and California, this percentage is 50% by 2030; in Vermont, 75% by 2032.[footnote]Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies, supra note 81. Direct comparison of these standards can be challenging\u2014one must know precisely what resources are included, whether or not renewables that existed before passage of the RPS are included, and what the natural resource endowment of the state is like. See Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1361.[\/footnote] In 2015, Hawaii adopted a 100% target by 2045.[footnote]Act of June 8, 2015, 2015 Haw. Sess.

Stat. Ann. tit. 30, \u00a7\u00a08002(21) (2016).[\/footnote] Some states use these schemes to express more idiosyncratic preferences tailored to local conditions.[footnote]See Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1360\u201362 (discussing differences in terms of four core RPS design traits); Steven Ferrey et al., Fire and Ice: World Renewable Energy and Carbon Control Mechanisms Confront Constitutional Barriers, 20 Duke Envtl.

Stat. \u00a7\u00a062-133.8(e) (2015) (establishing a specific requirement for swine waste).[\/footnote] Numerous states also establish \u201ctiers\u201d or \u201ccarve-outs\u201d within their RPSs, which mandate a certain amount of the overall requirement to come from particular resource types.

For example, plaintiffs suing to contest the legality of New York\u2019s ZEC program explain their concerns as follows: Providing existing nuclear units an out-of-market ZEC payment enables these nuclear plants to lower the price at which they bid into the market.[footnote]See Complaint at 19\u201323, Coal. for Competitive Elec. v.

In these regions, states have largely required utilities to sell off their generation assets, such that corporations building generators do not have the benefit of a captive monopoly rate base[footnote]In regulated regions, approved capital expenditures make up a utility\u2019s \u201crate base.\u201d The utility is entitled to recover the costs reflected in the rate base as well as a reason\u00adable rate of return, typically around ten percent per year.

That is to say, this group hoped to draft legisla\u00adtion related to decarbonization that would do as little as possible to shake up market shares, or political power, within the energy industry or beyond. In this group\u2019s view, accepting a policy actively designed to fore\u00adstall any significant distributional shifts is the surest way to achieve rapid deep decarbonization.\r\n\r\nIf this pathway were taken, the major political and economic players in the decarbonized future might not look so different from those of today\u2014many of the changes would play out behind the scenes of the electricity grid. All of us would get used to landscapes dotted by major utility-scale wind farms, nuclear power plants, solar arrays, and transmis\u00adsion lines, owned by companies like Exxon and BP.[footnote]Several of the big oil companies are already moving in this direction.

Colo. L. Rev. 571, 591\u2013609 (2017) (exploring the trend toward creating a \u201cparticipatory grid\u201d and the equity challenges it presents).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNow, consider a second, quite different pathway that a country or state could take toward decarbonization. This pathway emerges from the thesis of journalist Naomi Klein\u2019s 2014 book <em>This Changes Everything<\/em>.[footnote]Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate (2014).[\/footnote] In her view, the reason that the world has made so little progress on climate change is that \u201cthe Right is Right\u201d: Addressing climate change requires actions that \u201cdirectly challenge our reigning economic paradigm\u201d and \u201cspell extinction for the richest and most powerful industry the world has ever known\u2014the oil and gas industry.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 31, 63.[\/footnote] She doubts that any significant solution can be forged through cooperation with major corporations, citing the poor record of this strategy to date.[footnote]Id. at 207\u201349.[\/footnote] Instead, she sees the challenge of climate change as an opportunity to forge new grassroots alliances that link climate change to community health and that demand more democratic decisionmaking and local economic power.[footnote]See id. at 96\u201397, 360\u201361.[\/footnote] Climate change, in this view, \u201ccould be the catalyst to attack inequality at its core.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 409.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf this pathway toward decarbonization were pursued, there might be an efflorescence of city movements to reclaim their electricity grids from private ownership.[footnote]See Shelley Welton, Public Energy, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 267, 304\u201307 (2017) [hereinafter Welton, Public Energy] (documenting efforts in this vein).[\/footnote] Communities would collectively invest in locally sited solar and wind farms, deciding to pay more to support local clean energy and local jobs. Consumption of energy and other goods might fall as the country pursued low-growth economic policies that focused on delivering free time instead of material accumulation, in an effort to spread fewer resources more broadly.[footnote]See, e.g., Tim Jackson, Prosperity Without Growth: Economics for a Finite Planet 3, 151, 180 (2011) (asking \u201c[w]hat can prosperity possibly look like in a finite world\u201d and concluding that it might include consuming less, improving social equality, and working fewer hours).[\/footnote] Significant lifestyle changes might be required, including reduced consumption of meat and dairy, less car ownership, and fewer airplane trips.[footnote]See Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth, Just Transition: Is a Just Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy Possible Within Safe Global Carbon Limits? 4 (2011), <a href=\"http:\/\/friendsoftheearth.uk\/sites\/default\/files\/downloads\/just_transition.pdf\">http:\/\/\r\nfriendsoftheearth.uk\/sites\/default\/files\/downloads\/just_transition.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\nH77H-FXET] (finding these sacrifices necessary if the United Kingdom were to meet decarbonization goals while ensuring that \u201cessential needs for housing, transport and energy use are met\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get much further apart than these two visions of the decarbonized future\u2014one based entirely on political expediency and maintenance of the economic order; the other based on a vision of using the project of decarbonization to radically restructure political and social relations. Their coexistence hints at the range of possibilities that decar\u00adbonization holds for power structures, community character, and daily life. No matter how we approach it, decarbonization will shape more than just physical infrastructure, making it a <em>social <\/em>project as much as a technical one.\r\n\r\nThere is considerably more to be said about the many contours of the \u201csocial project\u201d of decarbonization, but much of it will have to wait for future work. This Article does not attempt to explore the range of potential considerations or solutions in their entirety, nor does it make any judgment about the most viable or desirable version of this social project. For the present argument, it is enough to understand that decar\u00adbonization is, inexorably, more than just a technical challenge. Discus\u00adsions around its trajectory implicate choices and values that extend far beyond what technologies are available at what costs.[footnote]Many scholars outside the legal field have forcefully made similar points.

The sections that follow contend that state politics present a better avenue for this determination than quasi-private, regional electricity markets.\r\n<h3>B. State Policies as Reflections of the Social Project of Decarbonization<\/h3>\r\nAlthough no state has embraced a vision of decarbonization near either extreme described above, state responses to climate change simi\u00adlarly evince an understanding of the significant political and value choices bound up in decarbonization policy.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, state variations in RPSs, which demonstrate pref\u00aderences for certain resources that are either locally abundant (for example, Maryland\u2019s chicken manure) or particularly desirable, but less economi\u00adcally competitive (for example, rooftop solar carve-outs).[footnote]See supra section I.B.[\/footnote] In both of these instances, states have chosen to promote certain aims beyond \u201cmere decarbonization\u201d\u2014that is, the lowest-cost decarbonization achievable.[footnote]Indeed, even the choice of a renewables requirement\u2014as opposed to a broader \u201cclean energy\u201d standard\u2014illustrates a preference in this regard. Lincoln Davies catalogues the many \u201cancillary benefits\u201d an RPS can bring. Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1357\u201359.[\/footnote] By including chicken manure in its RPS, Maryland provided a potential additional stream of revenue to the state\u2019s many poultry farmers, while diverting nitrogen-rich poultry manure from running off into the Chesapeake Bay\u2014a body of water that has faced significant problems of nitrogen overloading.[footnote]See Dep\u2019t of Legislative Servs. of Md.

A policy preference for distributed generation ensures that renewable energy built in a state will not all occur in large-scale, utility- or developer-led projects that consume open space. Instead, some of it will be located on the roofs and in the yards of state residents, providing them additional income streams and creating opportunities for new busi\u00adnesses to emerge in the electricity sphere.[footnote]See, e.g., Community Energy Solar, <a href=\"http:\/\/communityenergysolar.com\">http:\/\/communityenergysolar.com<\/a>\/about [http:\/\/perma.cc\/73SW-BEUM] (last visited Feb. 15, 2018) (noting that the company focuses on community solar development).[\/footnote] A built-in preference for solar serves a different end: It ensures that all of a state\u2019s renewable energy will not come from the cheapest source\u2014frequently wind\u2014but instead that state policy will work to promote multiple renewable energy technologies.[footnote]See, e.g., About the Solar Carve-Out Program, Mass.

Massachusetts politicians celebrated the state\u2019s 2016 legislation mandating offshore wind on this ground, proclaiming, for example: \u201cWhat we have here, as opposed to an amorphous bill of clean energy generally or greenhouse gases generally, is a specific technology\u2014an offshore wind economy\u2014that we\u2019re hoping to jump start and we have real incentives in place to make that happen.\u201d[footnote]Elise Harmon, In 2016, Massachusetts Passed a Landmark Renewable Energy Bill\u2014Here\u2019s What You Need to Know, New Eng.

Is It All Just Rent Seeking?<\/h3>\r\nIt is not difficult to conjure up a public-choice-minded skeptic\u2019s swift reaction to my argument: social project? These state policies are all just examples of successful rent seeking, in which certain powerful industries are benefitting to the detriment of the people of the state![footnote]\u201cPublic choice models\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. treat the legislative process as a microeconomic system in which \u2018actual political choices are determined by the efforts of individuals and groups to further their own interests; these efforts have been labeled \u2018rent-seeking.\u2019\u201d Daniel A. Farber &amp; Philip P. Frickey, The Jurisprudence of Public Choice, 65 Tex. L. Rev. 873, 878 (1987) (quoting Gary S.

Stigler, The Theory of Economic Regulation, 2 Bell J. Econ. &amp; Mgmt. Sci. 3, 3 (1971) (discussing the power of industries to influence and shape regulation for their own benefit).[\/footnote] A proponent of the rent-seeking hypothesis might suggest that most of the state pol\u00adicies detailed in this Article are deviations from the most efficient way to decarbonize, which would be to simply put a price on carbon.[footnote]See infra note 183 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] These deviations might be the result of successful lobbying on the part of particular clean-energy industries\u2014including nuclear, wind, and solar\u2014which have secured for themselves premium prices for their particular type of clean energy at the expense of ratepayers, who are largely unor\u00adganized, politically powerless players in these debates.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly important not to be na\u00efve about the motivations behind state climate policies. To respond to these concerns, this section makes two brief points. First, this Article\u2019s argument does not turn on a rejec\u00adtion of public choice theory or on proof that harmful rent seeking is absent from state climate policy. Public debate and public churn about the aims and methods of decarbonization are valuable <em>even if <\/em>they some\u00adtimes result in certain industries getting a boost. Unjustified rent seeking can be (and is being[footnote]See infra section III.C (discussing lawsuits against state policies).[\/footnote]) contested through the courts and in the theater of public debate. In contrast, utilizing RTO governance structures and energy markets as the locus for debating, hashing out, and implementing decarbonization policy shunts these debates to much more private, inaccessible quarters\u2014<em>without <\/em>eliminating the distinct possibility of rent seeking also occurring in those forums.[footnote]On RTO governance processes, see infra section III.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, it is not clear that state decarbonization policy preferences can easily be shrugged aside as examples of problematic rent seeking. To be sure, some of these state policies appear to favor certain industries. But in the case of the most dominant state policy, RPS, it is more fledg\u00adling solar and wind developers who stand to benefit most\u2014at the expense of established fossil fuel companies. That\u2019s hardly a predictable outcome under a public choice explanation of the companies most likely to hold sway with government. The same holds true for numerous other state policies that work against incumbent utility interests.[footnote]See Elias L. Quinn &amp; Adam L. Reed, Envisioning the Smart Grid: Network Architecture, Information Control, and the Public Policy Balancing Act, 81 U. Colo. L.

Even there, though, the supporters of the policy defy simplistic explanation\u2014the ZEC program divided the environmental community, with many groups coming out in support of it.[footnote]Clean Energy Standard Order, supra note 99, at 53 (noting \u201ccomments among environmental groups are divided\u201d).[\/footnote] This divi\u00adsion suggests that many saw ZECs as productively serving decarbonization goals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even accepting that some rent seeking may be at work in these policies, it might not be <em>bad <\/em>rent seeking.[footnote]Many scholars have remarked on the indeterminacy of the concept of \u201crent seek\u00ading\u201d\u2014one person\u2019s \u201crent\u201d is another person\u2019s social-welfare gain.

This suggestion works if indeed the state views efficiency as a good measure of social welfare. But if a state determines that other aims trump efficiency, then it might be perfectly justified in choosing policies that deviate substantially from a carbon tax.[\/footnote] This Article\u2019s argument is broader: Any apparent rent seeking in these policies may be justified as a way to fulfill values related to decarbonization that go beyond efficiency.[footnote]Cf. Mark Sagoff, Economic Theory and Environmental Law, 79 Mich. L. Rev. 1393, 1396\u201397 (1981) (explaining how many of our laws appropriately reflect preferences for ends other than efficiency); Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets, supra note 37, at 1024 (suggesting that Americans are interested in fairness and protection from market failure in addition to efficiency maximization).[\/footnote] When states establish climate change policies, they are\u2014at least in part\u2014channeling value judgments about how decarbonization should proceed.[footnote]The democratic link might appear weaker when agencies\u2014rather than legisla\u00adtures\u2014make decisions about the shape of decarbonization policy. There is, however, a literature suggesting that agencies might be better positioned in some ways to adopt dem\u00adocratically determined preferences. See Jerry L. Mashaw, Greed, Chaos, and Governance: Using Public Choice to Improve Public Law 37 (1999); Mark Seidenfeld, A Civic Republican Justification for the Administrative State, 105 Harv. L.

L.J. 97, 101\u201302 (2000).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nEmerging research suggests that the public has distinct preferences and value judgments related to decarbonization. In response to surveys and deliberative polls, individuals have expressed several values beyond pure economic efficiency they consider important in energy systems change, including \u201cnot wasting;\u201d environmental protection; stability, reli\u00adability, and affordability; autonomy and freedom; and social justice and fairness.[footnote]Butler et al., Public Values, supra note 147, at 667.[\/footnote] These diverse values lead people to have strong preferences for certain technologies over others;[footnote]Professor Dirk Scheer and his coauthors find a strong preference for renewable energy over fossil fuel generation combined with \u201ccarbon capture and storage.\u201d Dirk Scheer et al., Public Evaluation of Electricity Technologies and Future Low-Carbon Portfolios in Germany and the USA, 3 Energy, Sustainability &amp; Soc\u2019y, no. 8, 2013, at 1; see also Butler et al., Public Values, supra note 147, at 670 (describing \u201cpublic visions\u201d as \u201ccon\u00adverg[ing] with policy on some of the key areas, specifically reductions in fossil fuels, increases in RETS\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. , and the need for reductions in demand\u201d); Demski et al., supra note 147, at 59\u201360, 66 (finding a strong public preference, through deliberative work\u00adshops, among U.K. residents for \u201cmicro-generation technologies\u201d); Nick Pidgeon &amp; Christina C.

State policies on decarbonization, then, can be seen as attempts to capture the \u201cmessy, pluralistic, and pragmatic\u201d goals associated with the social project of decarbonization and to give voice to community judgments regarding the desired shape of our future decarbonized soci\u00adety.[footnote]See Kysar, supra note 38, at 3, 15\u201316 (making the argument that these charac\u00adteristics have always described the diverse goals of environmental policymaking).[\/footnote] Responding to and incorporating these preferences helps a state maintain broad citizen support for its decarbonization initiatives. With\u00adout this support, passing the laws necessary to reach \u201cdeep decarboniza\u00adtion\u201d levels of carbon mitigation will be all the more difficult.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is no guarantee that state policies are accurately chan\u00adneling residents\u2019 preferences in these regards.[footnote]Cf.

The next Part describes why regional electricity markets are a trouble\u00adsome mechanism for accomplishing the social project of decarbonization.\r\n<h2>III. Electricity-Market Redesign to Accomplish the Project of Decarbonization<\/h2>\r\nAlmost every academic (myself included) prefers that policies to address climate change include some sort of national carbon tax or cap-and-trade scheme.[footnote]There is, however, debate regarding whether carbon pricing should be supple\u00admented with additional policies. See Ann E. Carlson, Designing Effective Climate Policy: Cap-and-Trade and Complementary Policies, 49 Harv. J. on Legis. 207, 207 (2012) (explor\u00ading issues of complementarity and competition between economy-wide carbon policies and more targeted strategies). My argument here regarding the \u201csocial nature\u201d of the project of decarbonization leads me to conclude that supplementary policies are desirable to the extent that a polity wants to control the shape of decarbonization.[\/footnote] Putting a price on carbon is theoretically appealing because of its potential breadth, simplicity, and efficiency.[footnote]See Liscow &amp; Karpilow, supra note 168, at 457\u201363 (collecting sources in favor of carbon pricing); see also Peter Howard &amp; Derek Sylvan, Inst. for Policy Integrity, Expert Consensus on the Economics of Climate Change 2 (2015), <a href=\"http:\/\/policyintegrity.org\/files\/publications\/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf\">http:\/\/policyintegrity.org\/\r\nfiles\/publications\/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/DE98-N2RW] (report\u00ading survey results showing that 75% of expert economists favor a market-based mechanism for carbon); Jerry Taylor, Niskanen Ctr., The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax 3\u201310 (2015), http:\/\/niskanencenter.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/K8LE-Z9Q8] (arguing that the alternative to a carbon tax \u201cis a plethora of command-and-control regulatory interventions,\u201d which already \u201cimpose a sort of carbon tax\u201d).[\/footnote] Most states with robust decarbonization policies also support some sort of national carbon-pricing scheme, particularly one that would allow them to pursue additional side policies to address their citizens\u2019 decarbonization prefer\u00adences.[footnote]Most states do not, however, favor allowing federal policy to preempt supplemen\u00adtary state policies. See Memorandum from Mary D. Nichols, Cal. Air Res. Bd. et al., to Senators Kerry, Graham, &amp; Lieberman (Mar. 30, 2010) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (arguing that federal climate legislation should \u201cestablish a national carbon mar\u00adket and include national programs, while preserving states\u2019 rights to implement their own climate policies\u201d).[\/footnote] Despite its theoretical appeal, however, such a scheme is a politi\u00adcal pipe dream in the near term.[footnote]See, e.g., Timothy Cama, Trump Brings Big Changes to Climate Policies, The Hill (Feb. 10, 2017), <a href=\"http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/energy-environment\/318824-trump-brings-big-change-to-climate-policies\">http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/energy-environment\/318824-trump-brings-big-change-to-climate-policies<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/SV8N-JM7F] (discussing the Trump Administration and Republican Congress\u2019s climate policies, which largely favor limiting regulations and enacting measures to \u201cunwind Obama-era rules on energy\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn its place, proponents have advanced the idea of addressing decar\u00adbonization within regional electricity markets as a compromise measure. Although covering less of the country and less of the economy than a federal carbon price, including decarbonization aims in electricity markets still holds some advantages over state-by-state efforts. The many parties in favor of using markets to achieve decarbonization goals argue that market incorporation represents the most feasible way, in the cur\u00adrent political climate, to efficiently decarbonize.[footnote]See infra notes 197\u2013199.[\/footnote] At the same time, they suggest, incorporating state climate goals into markets would help con\u00adtrol the purported damage that variegated state climate policies do to regional electricity markets.[footnote]See supra section I.C.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Part first describes leading proposals for how to achieve state climate goals through RTO markets and the governance processes these proposals would have to go through. It then advances three reasons why the compromise measure of achieving decarbonization through electric\u00adity markets is a risky substitute for robust, democratically determined action on climate change. In brief, these reasons are that (1) procedur\u00adally, given RTO governance structures, using these market constructs to achieve climate goals would remove decisions over decarbonization fur\u00adther from the public view and democratic oversight; (2) substantively, incorporating climate goals into regional electricity markets would homogenize and water down state preferences; and (3) recent Supreme Court precedent creates a risk that once states cede control over decarboni\u00adzation to an RTO, they may give away some ability to adopt supplementary policies to strengthen or shape the trajectory of their decarbon\u00adization efforts.\r\n<h3>A. Proposed Market Reforms to Achieve State Policies<\/h3>\r\nStakeholders have proposed two predominant reforms to incorpo\u00adrate state climate aims into regional electricity markets. The first is for electricity markets to create their own carbon-pricing systems, analogous to a carbon tax. Thus, for example, certain stakeholders in New England\u2019s RTO have proposed the following scheme:\r\n<blockquote>Under a carbon pricing system, each electricity producer would pay an emissions fee in direct proportion to the amount of car\u00adbon (in tons) its generation facilities emit. The carbon emis\u00adsions price (that is, the fee per ton emitted) could be fixed, be a set price schedule that increases over time, or be dynamically adjusted based on aggregate performance over time to satisfy specific carbon reduction objectives.[footnote]ISO New England, NEPOOL 2016 IMAPP Proposals: Observations, Issues, and Next Steps 2 (2017) [hereinafter ISO-NE Proposal], http:\/\/www.iso-ne.com\/static-assets\/\r\ndocuments\/2017\/03\/iso-ne_jan_2017_imapp_memo_vtransmit2.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\n2354-QND3]. The ways in which this scheme would interact with the current carbon-pricing regime in the New England region are discussed in section IV.B.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nPJM\u2014the mid-Atlantic RTO\u2014has proposed a similar scheme, sug\u00adgesting a carbon-pricing system might also be pursued by a subset of the region interested in a carbon price, should the entire region prove unable to reach agreement.[footnote]PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives Through PJM\u2019s Energy Markets: A Review of Carbon-Pricing Frameworks 1 (2017) [hereinafter PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives], http:\/\/pjm.com\/~\/media\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/20170502-\r\nadvancing-zero-emission-objectives-through-pjms-energy-markets.ashx [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\nJ9B9-4N5X].[\/footnote] And New York\u2019s RTO has also come out in favor of a car\u00adbon-pricing scheme in that single-state market.[footnote]See Bradley C.

Probs., no. 1, 2017, at 139 (\u201cIncorporating externalities into the cost of production has the virtue of \u2018getting the price right\u2019 and moves the market toward the economically efficient outcome from a utilitarian social wel\u00adfare maximization perspective, in which the price paid for a good reflects the full marginal cost of its production.\u201d); Brattle Group, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 198, at 3 (\u201cThe most market-oriented approach to implementing a decarbonization policy is to price carbon emissions.\u201d).[\/footnote] Similarly, having a market scheme procure all of a region\u2019s renew\u00adable-energy demand would be a more efficient way to meet state RPSs than having each state\u2019s utilities go it alone.[footnote]See Brattle Group, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 198, at 4 (\u201c[C]lean energy markets would maximize competition and innovation by admitting new and exist\u00ading resources of all clean technologies (although they still would not provide as broad a price signal as carbon prices).\u201d); see also ISO-NE Proposal, supra note 189, at 4.[\/footnote] As a substantive matter, then, the argument for subsuming state climate policies into markets is relatively straightforward: It offers a more efficient way to accomplish state public policy aims while keeping electricity prices as \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d as possible. Relatedly, it avoids the need to constantly guard against potential market distortions caused by state public policies, thus maintaining predictable, well-functioning competitive markets.[footnote]See, e.g., EPSA, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 197, at 2 (arguing that FERC should incorporate decarbonization policies into markets as the strategy most \u201ccon\u00adsistent with investing private at-risk capital based on market price signals\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDespite widespread support, these proposals are not without challenges. One of these is legal\u2014it is not clear that federally overseen electricity markets have the mandate to include environmental considera\u00ad\u00adtions within their dispatch models. As noted in the introduction, many excellent legal minds are engaged in this analysis.[footnote]See supra note 35.[\/footnote] A second challenge is less strictly legal in nature, although it implicates jurisdictional fric\u00adtions. It is relatively clear what states might gain from integrating climate policies into regional electricity markets. But no action is without tradeoffs. What, then, do they stand to lose?

When it submits its final deci\u00adsions to FERC, however, an RTO board frequently explains major devi\u00adations from members\u2019 recommendations.[footnote]See, e.g., E4The Future, Inc., supra note 211, at 4 (noting that when the New England RTO provides a proposal to FERC without unanimous stakeholder support, it must \u201cexplain in its filing why its proposal is superior\u201d).[\/footnote] In practice, then, it is substantially easier for a board to establish that a proposed change is \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d if a substantial proportion of its members\u2014and its members\u2019 states\u2014so agree.[footnote]See supra note 210 and accompanying text (discussing the standard by which FERC evaluates an RTO\u2019s proposed changes).[\/footnote] Members, states, or other stakeholders that continue to disagree with an RTO proposal can protest the changes dur\u00ading FERC\u2019s vetting process or ultimately through a lawsuit.[footnote]See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0825l(b) (2012).[\/footnote] These pro\u00adtests can also be backed up by the more drastic measure of deciding to leave the RTO (in the case of member utilities)[footnote]See Dworkin &amp; Goldwasser, supra note 51, at 570 (arguing that members\u2019 ability to \u201cvote with [their] feet\u201d threatens RTO independence, as RTOs \u201cdesire to retain partici\u00adpants and geographic spread\u201d).[\/footnote] or requiring their utili\u00adties to leave the RTO (in the case of states).\r\n\r\nAny decision by an RTO to incorporate decarbonization objectives into market operations would occur through the process outlined above: An RTO board would determine\u2014by a requisite margin of votes\u2014that such changes would help to ensure \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d and would file a petition with FERC to have such changes approved.

Resulting Challenges for RTO Control of Decarbonization<\/h3>\r\nSeveral characteristics of RTOs make them imperfect sites for deci\u00adsions on the shape of decarbonization policies. This section details three particular flaws that should give states pause in ceding control over decarbonization policy to their RTOs: (1) RTO governance presents a diminished space for deliberative, democratic decisionmaking, as com\u00adpared to state politics; (2) RTO-governance structures create a tendency for policies to become homogenized and watered down when adopted at the regional level; and (3) the jurisdictional frictions created by <em>Hughes<\/em> pose a risk that states may diminish their own tools for controlling decar\u00adbonization if they cede the same functions to their RTOs.\r\n\r\n1. <em>A Loss of Public Procedure<\/em>. \u2014 The first challenge of RTO control over decarbonization policies has to do with RTOs\u2019 governance structure, and in particular, the relative sway of various stakeholders and members within RTO governance. Many suspect that stakeholders with assets man\u00adaged by the RTO\u2014that is, transmission owners\u2014have outsized influence, given that they can wield the threat of leaving the RTO should they be dissatisfied with a change in the governing rules.[footnote]See, e.g., American Municipal Power, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 112, at 2 (suggesting the \u201crules churn\u201d at PJM provides \u201ca cloak for \u2018gaming\u2019 behavior\u201d); see also, e.g., Dworkin &amp; Goldwasser, supra note 51, at 561\u201362 (noting stakeholder worries that RTOs are not as independent as they should be); Kavulla, supra note 56 (suggesting that \u201cusually\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. moneyed \u2018stakeholders\u2019 get their way\u201d); Kenneth Rose, Trouble in Market Paradise: Development of the Regional Transmission Operator, 50 J. Econ. Issues 535, 536 (2016) (noting RTOs\u2019 stakeholders include \u201cmarket participants\u201d with \u201cstrong economic interest[s] in RTO rules and procedures\u201d).[\/footnote] Similarly, although \u201cmembership\u201d is not limited to these asset holders, weighted voting by membership sector can stack the deck against public interest organiza\u00adtions or those without a strong foothold in the industry.[footnote]See Blumsack et al., supra note 215, at 3083 (\u201c[T]here may be limits to the degree to which organizations like RTOs can create mechanisms for heterogeneous stake\u00adholders with opposing interests to develop passable market rules and protocols.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if the stakeholder-committee processes were viewed as fair, participation in them would still be challenging. In a recent study that interviewed numerous participants in RTO governance, the tenor of many responses was along the following lines: To participate successfully, \u201cyou have to be a combination of an economist and a math wizard.\u201d[footnote]Stafford &amp; Wilson, supra note 212, at 230; see also id. (quoting a respondent des\u00adcribing these processes as \u201ca world of acronyms\u201d in which it is easy to get lost).[\/footnote] Others observed that the sheer quantity of stakeholder meetings at RTOs makes it impossible for smaller, less resourced organizations to participate.[footnote]Id. at 231 (quoting a respondent to highlight the multitude of RTO stakeholder meetings which often occur at overlapping times).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese challenges point to the first key risk of shunting decarboniza\u00adtion policy into RTOs: They offer considerably less transparent, only quasi-public frameworks in which to make these critically important deci\u00adsions. Although RTO-governance processes <em>nominally <\/em>give boards inde\u00adpendent decisionmaking power (a structure that itself already lessens public accountability), their membership rules and the weight that FERC gives to stakeholder opinions\u2014both as a matter of law and practice\u2014dampen this independence.[footnote]See Dworkin &amp; Goldwasser, supra note 51, at 562, 570\u201371 (noting RTOs\u2019 need to \u201cmaintain relationships with\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. stakeholders\u201d).[\/footnote] Thus, if RTOs take over decarbonization policymaking, it will not be elected public officials or their appointed bureaucrats, but private companies, who will hold much of the power to determine the shape of these efforts.\r\n\r\nHaving expressed these concerns about stakeholder governance, it is important to acknowledge some limits on the extent to which private companies would shape RTO-led decarbonization efforts, particularly on the front end. No RTO is likely to proceed with decarbonization efforts without support from participating states, at least in the current legal and political climate.[footnote]In contrast, if significant national climate change policy reemerged, one could imagine an RTO basing its authority to integrate decarbonization goals on this legal requirement, rather than on state legal requirements.[\/footnote] States hold this sway because of another feature of RTOs: their explicit disengagement from creating new \u201cpolicy.\u201d[footnote]Stafford &amp; Wilson, supra note 212, at 229 (suggesting state-level policy dictates RTO policy).[\/footnote] RTO representatives maintain: \u201cWe are a taker of policy not a maker of policy. .\u00a0.\u00a0. We don\u2019t create policy. We attempt to interpret policy as handed to us.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Because RTOs eschew any role in determining what the \u201cpublic interest\u201d is, states retain what Professor Christina Simeone has described as \u201can incredible amount of power and influence\u201d in shaping the interac\u00adtion of public policies and markets.[footnote]Simeone, supra note 205, at 27.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nRTOs disclaim this policymaking function for both political and legal reasons. Politically, it would be substantially harder to convince states to let their utilities join or remain in RTOs if membership meant ceding state policymaking authority to this quasi-private entity. As a legal matter, imagine if an RTO were to include any sort of decarbonization requirement\u2014such as a carbon price\u2014that caused a state\u2019s utilities to pay extra for electricity. For states in which state decarbonization policy supported this change, a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d finding would be under\u00adstandable\u2014as noted above, pricing carbon in the market would likely help the state accomplish its aims at the lowest price possible. In contrast, for any state that did not have a policy in place that supported this extra payment, a carbon price might well be \u201cunjust and unreasonable\u201d because it would force the residents of the state to pay more for reasons unsupported by any state or federal policy.[footnote]See Robert R. Scott, Comm\u2019r, N.H. Pub. Util.

RTOs would be unlikely to request such changes in their tariffs unless both stakeholder committees\u2014via super-majority vote\u2014and all states in a region endorsed the request. FERC, similarly, would be unlikely to approve the request if any state felt it unfairly required its customers to pay for more decarbonization than state law mandated. Not only would all of these negotiations occur deeper in the shadows than does state climate change policymaking, but this de facto near-consensus procedural requirement would also likely have troubling substantive impacts, discussed in the following section.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Homogenization and the Watering Down of Preferences<\/em>. \u2014 The second challenge with using RTOs to achieve state decarbonization aims is that their structure and legal mandate leaves them with a diminished set of policy tools as compared to states. Accordingly, the use of these markets to achieve state goals would likely entail both homogenization and water\u00ading down of state preferences.\r\n\r\nThe more drastic homogenizing force would come from imposition of a carbon price, which would require substantial regional agreement across a range of topics. The entire theory behind a carbon-pricing scheme is that it eliminates aims beyond the cheapest decarbonization achievable.[footnote]Peskoe, supra note 35, at 34 (suggesting the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d is not cur\u00adrently reflected in FERC rates).[\/footnote] Away would go state preferences for particular types of clean energy, particular locations or scales, or broad-based inclusion or redistribution as a part of decarbonization policy (except to the extent that states continued to pursue these goals through separate, state-specific side policies).[footnote]See Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets, supra note 37, at 988\u201392, 1001 (describing how energy markets reduce all decisionmaking to economic optimality, ignoring questions of redistribution or values other than efficiency). Whether states could pursue their desired suite of side policies would depend on how circuit courts interpret and apply <em>Hughes\u2013<\/em>\u2014a topic taken up infra section IV.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, states would also have to homogenize their timing and targets for decarbonization. In order for a carbon price to work, there would likely have to be a single price throughout a region.[footnote]See PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives, supra note 190, at 1 (\u201cTo avoid significant complexity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a single carbon price is required across the carbon price sub-region.\u201d). Brattle Group suggests a multistate region could possibly administer multiple carbon prices, although it admits that such an idea is \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cneeds to be developed further.\u201d See Brattle Group, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 198, at 4.[\/footnote] Setting this price would be challenging, given the divergent state decarbonization targets that exist in multistate regions.[footnote]See Conservation Law Found., FERC Technical Conference, supra note 199, at 1\u20132 (discussing the complexity of \u201cintegrating state policy preferences into RTO Markets\u201d); see also Brian Forshaw, Conn.

In this model, states could control their overall level of desired renewable procurement and pass this information on to the market operator.[footnote]In this way, the Clean Energy Market is not intended \u201cto eliminate or replace state renewable portfolio standards, but\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is a complimentary system for market procure\u00adment of the RECs needed to meet the RPS.\u201d Renew Northeast &amp; Nextera Energy, Presentation at NEPOOL IMAPP Meeting: A New IMAPP Proposal 13 (Jan. 25, 2017) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] But such a scheme would still require, at a minimum, agreement on qualifying resources. To be sure, the scheme could be designed to allow states to make requests for certain types, as well as amounts, of renewable power.[footnote]See id. at 6.[\/footnote] The more the market was segmented by resource type, however, the less benefit it would provide in the form of an interstate, least-cost auction.[footnote]See id.[\/footnote] Accord\u00adingly, a Forward Clean Energy Market would also create pressure to homogenize resource preferences in order to reap the benefits of creat\u00ading a regional auction.[footnote]Professor Felix Mormann confirms this argument by making a similar point with respect to the idea of pursuing a federal RPS, arguing that \u201c[g]eographic gains from a federal policy approach would likely come at the expense of a federal RPS\u2019s aspirational aggressiveness,\u201d because a \u201cfederally palatable RPS regime\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would likely aim lower aspi\u00adrationally and, ultimately, have a shallower impact.\u201d Mormann, supra note 36, at 1643.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe homogenizing forces described here present two distinct lines of concern. The first springs from theories of democratic experimentalism.[footnote]See Michael C. Dorf &amp; Charles F. Sabel, A Constitution of Democratic Experimentalism, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 267, 288 (1998) (arguing for greater use of \u201cdemo\u00adcratic experimentalism,\u201d in which localities experiment in government service provision and central regulators facilitate learning from one another\u2019s experimentation).[\/footnote] Because decarbonization is in the early stages of what looks to be a long, expensive, transformative slog, perhaps it is best at this stage to allow multiple models to flourish, instead of subsuming state policies into regional markets. Former FERC Chair Norman Bay adopted this position in a concurrence authored right before his resignation, in which he celebrated state decarbonization policies for their experimental character.[footnote]See N.Y. State Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. N.Y. Indep. Sys. Operator, Inc., 158 FERC \u00b6 61,137 (Feb. 3, 2017), 2017 WL 496267, at *12 (Bay, Comm\u2019r, concurring) (\u201cIn our consti\u00adtutional order, states are rightly celebrated for being laboratories for experimentation. Among other things, those laboratories may incentivize the development of needed energy infrastructure, the deployment of innovative technologies, or the establishment of Renewable Portfolio Standards.\u201d (footnote omitted)).[\/footnote] And Professors Ann Carlson and William Boyd have made a thoughtful case regarding the national decarbonization benefits that such state experiments can produce.[footnote]See Boyd &amp; Carlson, supra note 6, at 815 (explaining how state diversity in electricity governance has led to \u201cinteresting examples of policy innovation\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis classic \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d line of argument is compel\u00adling, but it captures only part of the challenge that states face as they con\u00adsider regionalizing their decarbonization efforts through RTOs. In this context, the choice is not simply between the state, regional, or federal <em>scale <\/em>as the locus of policymaking. Instead, choosing between the state and regional scale also implicates a fundamental choice between electric\u00adity <em>markets<\/em> or <em>regulation <\/em>as the fundamental driver of decarbonization. States that turn RPSs or carbon pricing over to RTOs must be willing to allow RTO governance to dictate the terms of these policies going for\u00adward. To relinquish control to a regional electricity market is thus to authorize a diminishment in the suite of tools and scope of control avail\u00adable to publicly manage decarbonization.\r\n\r\n3. <em>The Risk of Aggrandizing Market Control<\/em>. \u2014 There is an obvious objection to the argument made in the previous subsection: Why assume that if states were to give regional markets some control over achieving climate change goals, they could not continue to shape decarbonization\u2019s trajectory through complementary side policies if necessary? This argu\u00adment relates to an argument economists often make about the risks of mixing policy aims: Why not let markets take care of decarbonization as cheaply as possible and then let states craft <em>separate <\/em>policies to accomplish their additional aims? Wouldn\u2019t this be better than letting states design these inefficient, multifaceted policies that attempt to mash together the goals of decarbonization with social justice and economic growth?[footnote]See Eric A. Posner &amp; David Weisbach, Climate Change Justice 169\u201388 (2010) (discussing the \u201cethical obligations of wealthy nations\u201d in climate change policies); cf. Louis Kaplow &amp; Steven Shavell, Should Legal Rules Favor the Poor? Clarifying the Role of Legal Rules and the Income Tax in Redistributing Income, 29 J. Legal Stud. 821, 822\u201326 (2000) (advocating for an income-tax system, rather than legal rules, as a means of help\u00ading the poor).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe response to this argument again revolves around the patholo\u00adgies of electricity markets, and in particular, the way these markets oper\u00adate under shared state and federal jurisdiction.[footnote]I do not mean to argue that jurisdictional friction presents the only reason that states might prefer to create policies jointly aimed at decarbonization and other social goals. Others have written general rebuttals to the argument that redistributional aims should be separated from other policy goals. See, e.g., Daniel A. Farber, Climate Justice, 110 Mich. L. Rev. 985, 989 (2012) (reviewing Posner &amp; Weisbach, supra note 250) (\u201cTo say that we should not engage in redistribution unless we can implement the ideal form of redistribution is really to say that we should not engage in redistribution at all.\u201d); Lee Anne Fennell &amp; Richard H. McAdams, Fairness in Law and Economics: Introduction 5 (Univ. of Chi. Pub. Law &amp; Legal Theory, Working Paper No. 489, 2014) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (arguing the high political costs of tax redistribution may make it cheaper to redistribute outside the tax scheme). The jurisdictional churn in electricity law presents particular reason to eschew using these markets to decarbonize.[\/footnote] In brief, the challenge is this: Once a state cedes policy objectives to its regional electricity mar\u00adket, the state may suffer limits on its ability to craft supplementary poli\u00adcies or to reclaim the objectives if it does not like the results the market produces.\r\n\r\nThis argument no doubt appears strange at first blush. Why should a state lose its ability to reclaim control over public-policy objectives, if it only voluntarily gives the market control over these objectives in the first place? The complicating factor is a recent line of Supreme Court juris\u00adprudence interpreting the state\u2013federal boundary in electricity law, which updates the longstanding principle that \u201c[s]tates may not regulate in areas where FERC has properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale rates.\u201d[footnote]Miss. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 374 (1988).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOf particular relevance is the Supreme Court\u2019s 2016 decision in <em>Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC<\/em>, which considered a subsidy scheme devised by Maryland to incentivize power plants to build in the state.[footnote]136 S. Ct. 1288, 1294\u201395 (2016).[\/footnote] Although Maryland\u2019s RTO, PJM, ran a capacity market to ensure future resource adequacy throughout the region,[footnote]See Conn. Dep\u2019t of Pub.

The decision was 8-0, with two concurrences only \u201cto emphasize the narrowness of the holding.\u201d Hammond, supra note 35.[\/footnote] In so holding, the Court was careful to point out that states \u201cof course\u201d maintain authority to \u201cencour\u00adage construction of new in-state generation.\u201d[footnote]<em>Hughes<\/em>, 136 S. Ct. at 1298.[\/footnote] The particular problem with Maryland\u2019s scheme, though, was that the payments to the generator were \u201cconditioned on [its] capacity clearing the auction,\u201d such that they were too closely linked to interstate wholesale prices.[footnote]Id. at 1297 n.9.[\/footnote] In contrast, the Court passed no judgment on \u201cthe permissibility of various other measures States might employ to encourage development of new or clean generation, including tax incentives, land grants, direct subsidies, construction of state-owned generation facilities, or reregulation of the energy sector.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 1299.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nParticularly given this explicit disclaimer, it is hard to know exactly what <em>Hughes<\/em> portends for the host of policies that states have designed to decarbonize electricity.[footnote]See Hammond, supra note 35 (arguing that <em>Hughes<\/em> \u201ccombines an easily predicta\u00adble result on the merits with significant uncertainty for states going forward\u201d).[\/footnote] There is now a profusion of litigation challeng\u00ading state clean-energy policies under <em>Hughes\u2019 <\/em>logic.

Learjet, Inc.<\/em>[footnote]135 S. Ct. 1591 (2015).[\/footnote] and <em>FERC v. Electric Power Supply Ass\u2019n<\/em>.[footnote]136 S. Ct. 760 (2016).[\/footnote] The Court\u2019s 2016 decision in <em>Electric Power Supply Ass\u2019n<\/em> affirmed FERC\u2019s jurisdiction over any practice \u201cdirectly affecting\u201d wholesale rates, striking down states\u2019 arguments that FERC had overreached its jurisdic\u00adtion.[footnote]Id. at 760.[\/footnote] The year before, in <em>OneOK<\/em>, the Court clarified that field preemp\u00adtion of state energy law should turn on an analysis of the <em>purpose <\/em>of the state regulation, such that courts should examine \u201cthe target at which the state law aims in determining whether that law is pre-empted.\u201d[footnote]<em>OneOK<\/em>, 135 S. Ct. at 1599 (emphasis omitted). Interestingly, though, the Court did not rely on <em>OneOK<\/em>\u2019s test in deciding <em>Hughes<\/em> the following year.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFor present purposes, the fallout of <em>Hughes<\/em> and related precedents is that there might be substantial consequences to ceding new powers to regional electricity markets. <em>Hughes <\/em>made clear that because Maryland had granted PJM the right to control resource adequacy in the region by running a capacity market, the state lost some of its ability to concur\u00adrently strive to achieve the same goals. In contrast, right now RTOs claim no control over decarbonization. Quite the contrary: They specifically decry any obligation in this regard. But what if states were to grant their electricity-market operator control over decarbonization? Then, under the logic of <em>Hughes <\/em>and <em>OneOK<\/em>, states might be preempted from tying any state policies too closely to whatever market construct for decarbon\u00adization the RTO devised. In particular, states would have to be careful not to impermissibly \u201ctether\u201d their policies or prices for clean energy to the results of regional clean-energy or carbon markets.[footnote]See Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1299 (2016) (\u201cNothing in this opinion should be read to foreclose Maryland and other States from encouraging production of new or clean generation through measures \u2018untethered to a generator\u2019s wholesale market participation.\u2019\u201d (quoting Brief for Respondents at 40, <em>Hughes<\/em>, 136 S. Ct. 1288 (Nos. 14-614, 14-623), 2016 WL 183803)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo be sure, even if a state decided to allow decarbonization to pro\u00adceed through its RTO, many traditional state methods of encouraging decarbonization would likely not be threatened\u2014including tax breaks, financial incentives, and straightforward subsidies. Although part of the picture, these methods have not emerged as the predominant tools that states use to regulate climate. Instead, the most important state policies are those that proceed through rate regulation, including RPSs, ZECs, regional carbon prices, procurement mandates, and ratepayer support of certain technologies.[footnote]See Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 298\u2013306.[\/footnote] There is a reason that these policies predominate: They are funded not through general taxation but through the rate base. They are, in other words, a form of covert \u201ctaxation by regula\u00adtion,\u201d[footnote]Richard A. Posner, Taxation by Regulation, 2 Bell J. Econ. &amp; Mgmt. Sci. 22, 23 (1971) (describing the phenomenon of \u201cinternal subsidies,\u201d where policy aims are accom\u00adplished through the use of rate regulation); see also Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 278\u201380 (explaining how these climate change-related tools are a new version of Posner\u2019s classic internal subsidization).[\/footnote] which serves as a more politically feasible way to meet decarbon\u00adization aims than direct taxation.[footnote]Whether rate regulation presents a <em>superior <\/em>mechanism for accomplishing decar\u00adbonization as compared to more general taxation is a question beyond the scope of this Article. Rossi provides a partial defense of such policies in <em>Carbon Taxation by Regulation<\/em>, supra note 8. Rossi argues that carbon taxation by regulation can and does function as an effective\u2014albeit fragmented\u2014substitute for carbon regulation but suggests that several reforms would help it do so more effectively. See id. at 323\u201341.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUnder the <em>Hughes <\/em>framework, these popular forms of \u201ccarbon taxa\u00adtion by regulation\u201d would be particularly threatened by RTO jurisdiction over decarbonization. Regional carbon-pricing and state procurement schemes would be at risk if they were designed in ways that pegged their pricing to market outcomes.[footnote]See <em>Hughes<\/em>, 136 S. Ct. at 1299.[\/footnote] Even Renewable Portfolio Standards\u2014the central mechanism of state clean-energy policy to date\u2014might prove vulnerable under an expansive interpretation of <em>Hughes<\/em>, should a state wish to pursue an RPS design that differs from a regional clean-energy procurement market.[footnote]Part IV describes why an expansive reading of <em>Hughes<\/em>, of the sort that would inval\u00adidate RPSs, is unlikely. Nevertheless, the concern is a live one, even absent RTO subsumma\u00adtion of decarbonization goals. Several parties in the ZEC litigation have worried that if ZECs are illegal, so too are RPSs. See Joel Eisen, The New (Clear?) Electricity Federalism: Federal Preemption of States\u2019 \u201cZero Emissions Credit\u201d Programs, 45 Ecology L.Q. (forthcoming 2018) (manuscript at 18) [hereinafter Eisen, Electricity Federalism] (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (collecting commentators raising this concern). Many participants in the ZEC litigation, however, assert that ZECs are different in kind from RPSs and other state policies. See Proposed Brief of Amicus Curiae American Wind Energy Ass\u2019n in Support of Neither Party at 2, Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Star, No. 1:17-cv-01163 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 13, 2017). In his forthcoming article, Professor Joel Eisen argues for a reading of <em>Hughes <\/em>and related cases that would invalidate ZECs but allow state RPS policies to stand. See Eisen, Electricity Federalism, supra (manuscript at 19) (\u201cZECs aim directly at remedy\u00ading the revenue shortfall on the wholesale markets. RECs do not, because they are designed with reference to environmental attributes, not wholesale market prices.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nA hypothetical example helps illustrate these concerns. Consider the case in which a state wishes to promote a particular type of renewable resource in the state that its RPS is inadequately incentivizing\u2014say, off\u00adshore wind. Right now, in order to promote more offshore wind, a state would be free to offer that generator a long-term premium <em>on top of <\/em>REC prices that fluctuates based on how much the generator is able to earn from the REC market.[footnote]See WSPP Inc., 139 FERC \u00b6 61,061 (Apr. 20, 2012), 2012 WL 1395532, at *4 (find\u00ading that the separate sale of RECs does not fall within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction).[\/footnote] The state might find this particular method for promoting certain renewables quite attractive, as it would create long-term investor certainty without complicating the state\u2019s RPS or causing residents to overpay.[footnote]See supra note 95.[\/footnote] But if renewables procurement were to become RTO administered and FERC jurisdictional (through proposals such as a regional clean-energy market), it is unclear whether such a scheme would survive. It might, under the logic of <em>Hughes <\/em>and <em>OneOK<\/em>, be too closely tethered in purpose or effect to the newly FERC-jurisdic\u00adtional clean-energy market.\r\n\r\nLess hypothetically, consider New York\u2019s current study of adopting a single-state RTO carbon adder. There, regulators have proposed that a market carbon price and the state REC program can and should operate simultaneously.[footnote]Newell et al., supra note 194, at iv (\u201cWe assume the carbon charge is designed to com\u00adplement (rather than replace)\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. existing policies that contribute to decarbonization.\u201d).[\/footnote] To facilitate this dual scheme, an August 2017 study by the Brattle Group proposed that \u201c[f]uture REC contracts could be struc\u00adtured so that the price adjusts automatically with changes in carbon prices, mitigating regulatory uncertainty associated with a carbon charge.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 46.[\/footnote] Again, under the logic of <em>Hughes<\/em>, it is not clear that such teth\u00adering would be permissible.[footnote]The legality of this proposal might turn on structural details, including the extent to which the state required such automatic price-adjustment mechanisms in REC contracting.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOf course, the risks that <em>Hughes <\/em>and related decisions pose remain largely inchoate. As such, it is hard to know how to factor them into pressing decisions on decarbonization policy and markets. This Article\u2019s final section clarifies how states might integrate these developing risks into decisionmaking about the future of their climate change policies.\r\n<h2>IV. Implications for Current Electricity-Law Debates<\/h2>\r\nSo far, this Article has explored some dangers in using regional elec\u00adtricity markets as a tool to accomplish the \u201csocial project\u201d of decarboniza\u00adtion. At the same time, the Article does not intend to give short shrift to these markets\u2019 potency as a potential least-cost solution or as a bargaining tool in interstate climate negotiations. To evaluate these tradeoffs, section IV.A first lays out some variables to help states assess whether regional electricity-market integra\u00adtion of decarbonization objectives is in their best interest. Sections IV.B and IV.C then briefly explore options for regionalizing climate policy outside RTOs and how markets might adapt to accommodate such schemes. Finally, section IV.D examines what this Article\u2019s argu\u00adment portends for laggard states, as opposed to states taking the lead on climate change.\r\n<h3>A. Deciding Whether to Regionalize Through Electricity Markets<\/h3>\r\nThe limitations and pathologies of regional electricity markets iden\u00adtified in this Article suggest that states should assess three variables in deciding whether to aggressively pursue the integration of climate goals into these markets: (1) the relative priority of advancing least-cost solutions; (2) the evolution of legal doctrine surrounding federal\u2013state jurisdiction over electricity policy; and (3) regional politics.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Relative Priority of Least-Cost Solutions<\/em>. \u2014 Much of this Article\u2019s anal\u00adysis has centered on the ways in which state climate policies evince an understanding of decarbonization as a social project with multifaceted goals. State climate policies illustrate attention to distributional conse\u00adquences, the risks and externalities associated with various low-carbon technologies, and the ways in which transforming energy can also trans\u00adform state economies. But leading states are also pursuing ambi\u00adtious targets, which are likely to cost substantial sums to achieve.[footnote]See Ron Binz et al., Practicing Risk-Aware Electricity Regulation: What Every State Regulator Needs to Know 5\u20136 (2012), http:\/\/www.raponline.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/ceres-binzsedano-riskawareregulation-2012-apr-19.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/5RJQ-DQF5] (predicting that retail electricity prices will \u201crise sharply\u201d in the next twenty years due to the level of investment needed in the U.S. electricity sec\u00adtor); James H. Williams et al., Pathways to Deep Decarbonization in the United States 1, 24 (2014), <a href=\"http:\/\/unsdsn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/US-Deep-Decarbonization-Report.pdf\">http:\/\/unsdsn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/US-Deep-Decarbonization-Report.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/W45R-MF7Z] (estimating the median price of cutting car\u00adbon dioxide emissions 80% from 1990 levels by 2050 to be between $160 billion and $650 billion).[\/footnote] It could be that as implementation progresses, affordability will become the dominant priority for states pursuing decarbonization.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the first question state policymakers considering regional integration might ask is: How important is <em>least-cost<\/em> decarboniza\u00adtion to state residents, as compared to a more managed decarbonization trajectory that incorporates other goals? The more the scale tilts in favor of affordability as a central criterion, the greater the benefits of regional\u00adization through electricity markets.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding decarbonization as a social project also points to some useful conclusions about what kind of regional market design for decarbonization states might prefer. In particular, a Forward Clean Energy Market in which states can funnel their decarbonization prefer\u00adences into the market design presents less of a relinquishment of state control than does a region-wide climate price.[footnote]See supra section III.A for a detailed description of these two policy options.[\/footnote] Of course, a clean-energy market also presents a less thoroughly efficient solution\u2014again highlighting the importance of prioritizing state aims relating to decarbonization.\r\n\r\nOne final word regarding temporality is in order. Even if a state finds that a particular market construct for achieving decarbonization might perfectly achieve its aims at time zero, there is a long-term risk to ceding such control to the market. Given the scale of the enterprise of deep decarbonization, a state\u2019s goals and preferences regarding the shape of decarbonization may well evolve over time.[footnote]See, e.g., Weiner, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 159, at 5 (expressing concern that wholesale market integration of climate policy \u201cwould likely hinder States in adapting to changing times\u201d); cf. Mhairi Aitken, Why We Still Don\u2019t Understand the Social Aspects of Wind Power: A Critique of Key Assumptions Within the Literature, 38 Energy Pol\u2019y 1834, 1835 (2010) (noting research that regarding nuclear power plants, \u201cpublic attitudes are not stable but rather adapt and change in relation to events or changing situations\u201d).[\/footnote] If state aims change such that affordability ceases to be the priority criterion, a state may have lim\u00adited recourse once it has ceded decarbonization imperatives to the mar\u00adket, other than full-scale market exit.\r\n\r\nThis temporal constraint appears particularly acute with respect to carbon-pricing schemes, which may \u201clock in\u201d investments that states do not want their ratepayers to support.[footnote]See generally Karen C. Seto et al., Carbon Lock-in: Types, Causes, and Policy Implications, 41 Ann. Rev. Env\u2019t. &amp; Resources 425 (2016) (describing the path-dependent processes that prevent the emergence of low-carbon alternatives).[\/footnote] A regional carbon price would likely incentivize near-term investments in new combined-cycle natural gas facilities, which could displace higher-emitting fossil fuel facilities.[footnote]See Newell et al., supra note 194, at 33.[\/footnote] But states may not want a carbon-price scheme to help finance construc\u00adtion of these types of facilities, given their inability to contribute to long-term \u201cdeep decarbonization\u201d targets.[footnote]Cf. Liscow &amp; Karpilow, supra note 168, at 421\u201322 (suggesting reasons for states to target a few promising cleantech options in their climate investment).[\/footnote] States weighing market integra\u00adtion should thus carefully evaluate not only short-term goals but also the compatibility of a market scheme with their long-term aims.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Evolving Legal Risk<\/em>. \u2014 The second variable that can help shape state decisions regarding decarbonization and electricity markets is that of evolving legal risk. As traced in section III.E, the <em>Hughes <\/em>decision has opened up a new line of attack on state climate policies. How these cases play out in the coming years should influence decisions about whether to decarbonize through regional markets.\r\n\r\nConsider first the outcome in which courts give <em>Hughes <\/em>its narrowest possible reading. Courts in this instance would hold that <em>Hughes <\/em>preempts only those state policies that <em>explicitly <\/em>condition receipt of some benefit on clearing wholesale electricity markets.[footnote]Cf. Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, Nos. 17-cv-01163 &amp; 17-cv-01164, 2017 WL 3008289, at *13 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017), appeal docketed sub nom. Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Star, No. 17-2445 (7th Cir. July 17, 2017) (\u201c<em>Hughes<\/em> should not be extended to invalidate state laws that do not include an express condition, but that in practice (and when combined with other market forces), have the effect of conditioning payment on clearing the wholesale auction.\u201d).[\/footnote] In that case, states might feel more confident in ceding some authority over decarboniza\u00adtion to regional electricity markets, because they could assume such shared authority would place limited constraints upon state power. A state in this scenario would likely maintain considerable ability to shape its decarbon\u00adization trajectory, so long as complementary state policies were not explicitly conditioned on certain regional decarbonization mar\u00adket outcomes.\r\n\r\nNow consider the (in my opinion, less likely[footnote]See Peskoe, supra note 35, at 41 (\u201cRenewable portfolio standards\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. have co-existed with FERC-regulated markets for nearly two decades with little significant legal controversy.\u201d); supra note 276.[\/footnote]) outcome in which courts use the logic of <em>Hughes <\/em>to strike down RPSs, nuclear subsidies, and special procurement orders as intruding on federal jurisdiction over regional electricity markets. In that case, states would be faced with a conundrum. On the one hand, states would be left with considerably fewer climate policy options <em>other<\/em> than using regional electricity markets, since their primary policy levers to date would be impermissible. On the other hand, a decision to cede decarbonization objectives to the market would likely take even more policy options off the table, given that <em>Hughes <\/em>and its progeny in this scenario would stand for the proposition that states are prohibited from enacting a broad range of policies that too thoroughly impact regional markets. In this case, states would be faced with difficult choices between returning to the drawing board in terms of how to craft state climate policies, or giving in to the pressure to let the markets do their decarbonization work for them.\r\n\r\nFinally, consider the emerging middle-ground scenario, in which courts develop a sliding scale for determining which state policies are too closely \u201ctethered\u201d to wholesale markets.[footnote]Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1299 (2016).[\/footnote] Early indications are that courts are likely to head in this direction. In June 2017, the Second Circuit became the first circuit court to interpret <em>Hughes<\/em>, ruling on a challenge to Connecticut\u2019s use of its procurement laws to encourage more solar energy.[footnote]See Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 2017).[\/footnote] The plaintiff in that case argued that Connecticut\u2019s procurement scheme should be preempted under the logic of <em>Hughes<\/em>, since the state was directing its utilities to enter into a specific wholesale contract and therefore interfering with federal jurisdiction over wholesale electricity pricing.[footnote]See id. at 86, 92.[\/footnote] The Second Circuit dodged the direct preemption argument, instead finding that Connecticut\u2019s law did not <em>compel<\/em> utilities to enter into contracts with the winning bidders of the procurement process.[footnote]See id. at 97\u201398.[\/footnote] The court thus left open the question of whether a state scheme that more clearly required utilities to enter into contracts with certain renewable resources would be preempted. Never\u00adtheless, the court took a moment to opine on <em>Hughes<\/em>, observing that Connecticut\u2019s scheme appears quite different from Maryland\u2019s failed pro\u00adgram, given that Connecticut\u2019s program involves traditional bilateral con\u00adtracts that are in no way conditioned on certain resources clearing the regional capacity auction.[footnote]Id. at 99, 102.[\/footnote] As such, Connecticut\u2019s contracts resemble \u201cprecisely what the <em>Hughes<\/em> court placed outside its limited holding.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 99.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn July 2017, U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and the Southern District of New York reached similarly limited conclu\u00adsions in dismissing lawsuits against Illinois\u2019s and New York\u2019s ZEC pro\u00adgrams.[footnote]Coal. for Competitive Elec. v. Zibelman, 272 F. Supp. 3d 554, 571 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), appeal docketed, No. 17-2654 (2d Cir. Aug. 25, 2017); Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, Nos. 17-cv-1163 &amp; 17-cv-1164, 2017 WL 3008289, at *1 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017), appeal docketed sub nom. Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Star, No. 17-2445 (7th Cir. July 17, 2017).[\/footnote] The first opinion to be issued concerned Illinois. Plaintiffs in that case argued, inter alia, that the ZEC program violated the <em>Hughes<\/em> standard for preemption because it was too closely tied to wholesale prices, since Illinois\u2019s program allowed for the price of ZECs to be adjusted based on predictions of wholesale prices.[footnote]<em>Star<\/em>, 2017 WL 3008289, at *4, *10.[\/footnote] The court rejected this argument, reasoning that basing ZEC prices on future projected wholesale prices is not an interference with the wholesale market that rises to the level of <em>Hughes<\/em>.[footnote]Id. at *11. The court also rejected an argument that receipt of ZECs was implicitly tied to participation in wholesale markets. Id. at *12\u201313.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Southern District of New York reached the same conclusion regarding that state\u2019s program. Its opinion emphasized that <em>Hughes<\/em> was focused on the \u201cimpermissible tether\u201d of required participation in the wholesale market and that New York\u2019s ZEC program required nothing of the sort.[footnote]<em>Zibelman<\/em>, 272 F. Supp. 3d at 569.[\/footnote] Moreover, the court observed, the ZEC program \u201cdoes not guarantee a certain wholesale price that displaces the market-determined price\u201d but rather simply places a separate value on the environmental attributes of nuclear.[footnote]Id. at *17. For this reason, the court found the scheme indistinguishable from RPS and RECs, which it noted FERC has long determined fall outside its jurisdiction. Id. at *13.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Illinois and New York decisions have been appealed to the Seventh and Second Circuits, respectively.[footnote]<em>Zibelman<\/em>, 272 F. Supp. 3d 554, appeal docketed, No. 17-2654 (2d Cir. Aug. 25, 2017); <em>Star<\/em>, 2017 WL 3008289, appeal docketed, No. 17-2445 (7th Cir. July 18, 2017).[\/footnote] These courts are now tasked with drawing a delicate line between schemes that come too close to elec\u00adtricity markets in design or in purpose[footnote]On the \u201cpurpose\u201d point, it is interesting to note that both courts highlighted this line of inquiry from <em>OneOK<\/em> and emphasized the extent to which the state ZEC programs had environmental goals that were quite distinct from wholesale-market aims. See <em>Zibelman<\/em>, 272 F. Supp. 3d at 571; <em>Star<\/em>, 2017 WL 3008289, at *10\u201311.[\/footnote] and those that stay further away from pegging their schemes to market prices and functions. The fact that this jurisprudence appears to be shaping itself around this inquiry should at least give states pause about ceding control over decarbonization to the markets. In doing so, states risk carving out more room for their poli\u00adcies to become constrained by regional markets\u2019 integration of the pro\u00adject of decarbonization.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Regional Politics<\/em>. \u2014 One final variable relevant to state decisionma\u00adking on integrating climate change aims into regional electricity mar\u00adkets is that of regional politics. This Article painted regional electricity-market governance as suffering from pathologies that are likely to yield least-common-denominator solutions.[footnote]See supra sections III.B\u2013.C.[\/footnote] This potentiality is least prob\u00adlematic in one-state RTOs like New York. That state is more likely to be able to translate its climate goals into a market-based scheme that fully reflects its decarbonization aims\u2014leaving one fewer variable for state regulators there to contend with.[footnote]Such is particularly the case if state regulators retain control over establishing the level of carbon pricing. Cf. Newell et al., supra note 194, at 22 (dodging the political ques\u00adtion of how New York\u2019s price might be set in noting that \u201c[p]olicymakers should define a process for determining the price and modifying it over time\u201d and that \u201c[t]his process could be led or informed by the NYPSC and other state agencies\u201d).[\/footnote] In multistate regions, though, the challenge of watering down is quite real. But even there, perhaps aggres\u00adsive states might use market integration as a bargaining chip in negotia\u00adtions with other states that are worried about state climate policies\u2019 desta\u00adbilizing effects on the regional market. In particular, they might suggest to a recalcitrant state: \u201cUp the ambition of your RPS five percent, or allow the market to use a higher price on carbon, and we will commit to pursuing regional decarbonization through the market.\u201d It is not clear whether laggard states see enough appeal to using electricity markets that such a promise could motivate them to greater action on climate change. But the more states find this outcome plausible, the more appealing using regional electricity markets to decarbonize might be.\r\n<h3>B. Thinking Outside the Market: State-Led Climate Policy Regionalization<\/h3>\r\nMuch of the appeal of using regional electricity markets to accom\u00adplish climate change aims comes from the opportunity they present for capitalizing on the efficiencies of a larger, regional market construct. But if that\u2019s the draw for states, then electricity markets are far from the only method available. Many states have already devised regional solutions through cooperative arrangements that avoid the pathologies of electric\u00adity markets.[footnote]See Sarah Hofmann, Comm\u2019r, Vt. Pub. Serv. Bd., Exec. Comm. Nat\u2019l Council on Elec. Policy (NCEP), Statement at FERC Technical Conference: State Policies and Wholesale Markets Operated by ISO-New England, Inc., New York Independent System Operator, Inc. and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., at 3 (May 1, 2017), <a href=\"http:\/\/electricitypolicy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2017\/05\/Statement-of-Commissioner-Hofmann-for-FERC-tech-conference-on-Ma-1.pdf\">http:\/\/electricitypolicy.org\/\r\nwp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2017\/05\/Statement-of-Commissioner-Hofmann-for-FERC-tech-conference-on-Ma-1.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/89QD-L2HX] (argu\u00ading to FERC that states \u201care well suited to collaboratively working out answers to the policy questions\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTwo successful examples predominate.[footnote]States were also actively pursuing regional solutions to Clean Power Plan compli\u00adance until the Trump Administration announced plans to dismantle these regulations. See Susan F. Tierney &amp; Paul J. Hibbard, Analysis Grp., Carbon Control and Competitive Wholesale Electricity Markets: Compliance Paths for Efficient Market Outcomes 22\u201326 (2015), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.analysisgroup.com\/uploadedfiles\/content\/insights\/publishing\/clean_power_plan_markets_may_2015_final.pdf\">http:\/\/www.analysisgroup.com\/uploadedfiles\/content\/insights\/publishing\/clean_\r\npower_plan_markets_may_2015_final.pdf<\/a> [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/DEY4-WC2B<\/strong>] (encour\u00adaging states to adopt regional Clean Power Plan compliance plans that track market borders); see also Exec.

Reg. 16,093, 16,095 (Mar. 31, 2017) (instructing the EPA Administrator to review the Clean Power Plan with an eye toward withdrawal).[\/footnote] The first is a regional cap-and-trade program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which nine northeastern states have been running since 2009.[footnote]See RGGI, supra note 75.[\/footnote] In this scheme, participating states devised a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d that set forth negotiated carbon-reduction targets for each state, along with a plan for each state to adopt legislation approving of the regional scheme.[footnote]RGGI, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative: Memorandum of Understanding 1\u201311 (2005), http:\/\/www.rggi.org\/docs\/mou_12_20_05.pdf [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/PVB6-BL3Y]<\/strong>; see also Craig, supra note 85, at 821 (explaining RGGI\u2019s structure).[\/footnote] All states were able to pass such legislation, bringing the scheme into force. Under the program as it is currently run, each genera\u00adtor that emits carbon pollution must purchase enough credits to cover its emissions from a region-wide auction.[footnote]Fact Sheet: RGGI CO<sub>2<\/sub> Allowance Auctions, RGGI, http:\/\/www.rggi.org\/docs\/RGGI_\r\nAuctions_in_Brief.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6YQB-MD23] (last visited Jan. 20, 2018).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nRGGI has coexisted for almost ten years alongside the PJM, NYISO, and ISO-New England regional electricity markets with scant complaints regarding market interference. Generators simply factor the cost of RGGI allowances into their expenses, on which they base their bids into regional electricity markets.[footnote]See Peskoe, supra note 35, at 44. Peskoe notes, however, that RGGI, too, might face increased risk of preemption if participating states pursue a FERC-jurisdictional car\u00adbon price. See id.[\/footnote] Clearly this requirement to at least par\u00adtially internalize the costs of carbon emissions has an impact on the prices at which these generators offer electricity to the regional markets, but no one argues that it creates a distortionary effect.[footnote]See Tierney &amp; Hibbard, supra note 305, at 25 (asserting that RGGI \u201callows for seamless implementation in centralized wholesale power markets\u201d).[\/footnote] RGGI thus stands as proof that it is possible to concoct a regional pricing scheme <em>outside <\/em>the regional electricity market without causing undue interference.\r\n\r\nRGGI is not an unmitigated success\u2014otherwise, many of its partici\u00adpants would hardly now be considering building carbon pricing into their regional electricity markets. RGGI\u2019s main problem, quite simply, is that the caps that states were able to agree upon for RGGI\u2014and the resultant allowance prices\u2014have been too low to accomplish the most ambitious states\u2019 decarbonization goals.[footnote]See Memorandum of Law, supra note 154, at 6 n.12 (\u201c[T]he RGGI program is not sufficient to meet New York\u2019s 50 percent renewables and 40 percent [greenhouse gas] reduction goals, and changing RGGI to achieve more ambitious goals \u2018is not within the State\u2019s unilateral control.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted) (quoting Clean Energy Standard Order, supra note 99, at 133)).[\/footnote] Nevertheless, RGGI has functioned as a base policy upon which states can build the myriad other decarboniza\u00adtion policies discussed in this Article. And RGGI can function in this manner because a regional \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d creates no risk of wresting away state power to address decarbonization simultane\u00adously at the state level. At the same time, building upon years of trust among states, RGGI has twice succeeded in lowering its program carbon cap, thus raising the cost of allowance prices and strengthening the program\u2019s effects.[footnote]See RGGI, Summary of RGGI Model Rule Changes: February 2013, at 3 (2013), http:\/\/www.rggi.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Uploads\/Design-Archive\/Model-Rule\/2012-Program-Review-Update\/Summary_of_Model_Rule_Changes_02_07_13.pdf [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/BDS4-P46G<\/strong>]; Dale Bryk, East Coast States Strengthen Power Plant Pollution-Cutting Program, Set Model for Nation, NRDC Expert Blog (Feb. 7, 2013), http:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/experts\/\r\ndale-bryk\/east-coast-states-strengthen-power-plant-pollution-cutting-program-set-model [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/56SH-4SJH<\/strong>]; Bruce Ho &amp; Jackson Morris, RGGI Agrees to Cut Power Plant Pollution by Another 30%, NRDC Expert Blog (Aug. 23, 2017), http:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/experts\/bruce-ho\/rggi-agrees-cut-power-plant-pollution-another-30 [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/V5BH-WW39<\/strong>].[\/footnote] RGGI\u2019s structure thus presents an appealing alterna\u00adtive to electricity-market integration for states intent on regionalization.\r\n\r\nA second example of regional cooperation on decarbonization out\u00adside of electricity markets comes from regional trading of RECs\u2014the renewable energy credits that utilities use to demonstrate compliance with state RPS.[footnote]See supra notes 85\u201386 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] To date, most REC markets are single state\u2014thus creating what many critics have bemoaned as unnecessarily constricted trading pools.[footnote]See Crandall, supra note 86, at 896; Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1343\u201344; Mack et al., supra note 86, at 18; Mormann, supra note 36, at 1644\u201345.[\/footnote] But the New England states have created a regional market for RECs that enlarges the pool of RECs available to create a more stable, fluid market.[footnote]See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a016-245a(b) (2017); see also Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 89\u201390 (2d Cir. 2017) (describing the program); Mack et al., supra note 86, at 20 (same).[\/footnote] They have done so through state laws that allow for gen\u00aderators to satisfy state RPS obligations with RECs purchased from any generator in the region that meets the state-specific definition of \u201crenew\u00adable,\u201d or similarly, from a renewable generator <em>outside <\/em>the New England region that can demonstrate that its renewable energy was imported into the region.[footnote]See, e.g., Vt. Pub. Serv. Dep\u2019t, Types of Renewable Energy Credits in New England: A Summary 1 (2015) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). A renewable energy generator outside the region can satisfy this requirement with help from a regional track\u00ading system that monitors the renewable energy imported from surrounding ISOs and other entities. See id.; see also <em>Klee<\/em>, 861 F.3d at 92.[\/footnote] In this way, New England already orchestrates regional cooperation on renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThese programs suggest that regional cooperation can flourish with\u00adout having to relinquish control to quasi-private governance organiza\u00adtions that are not under state oversight. To be sure, both RGGI and New England\u2019s REC-sharing arrangement carry their own legal risk. Commentators frequently point to the dangers of both the Compact Clause[footnote]The Compact Clause prohibits states from entering \u201cinto any Agreement or Compact with another State\u201d without the consent of Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a010. But not all compacts are prohibited\u2014the critical question, as formulated by the Supreme Court in U.S. Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Comm\u2019n, 434 U.S. 452, 493 (1978), is whether the agreement increases the \u201cpolitical power\u201d of participating states.[\/footnote] and the Dormant Commerce Clause[footnote]The Dormant Commerce Clause prohibits states from enacting measures grounded in economic protectionism, which \u201cbenefit in-state economic interests by bur\u00addening out-of-state competitors.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Davis, 553 U.S. 328, 338 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 273\u201374 (1988)).[\/footnote] when it comes to pro\u00adgrams like these.[footnote]See, e.g., Craig, supra note 85, at 771, 786, 820 (highlighting potential constitu\u00adtional infirmities with RGGI and regional RECs); Note, The Compact Clause and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 1958, 1965 (2007). See generally Ferrey et al., supra note 92 (examining constitutional challenges to a feed-in tariff for renewable power).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese risks are not theoretical\u2014both RGGI and the New England REC program have faced lawsuits on these grounds.[footnote]See North Dakota v. Heydinger, 825 F.3d 912, 920\u201321 (8th Cir. 2016) (striking down Minnesota\u2019s law providing that \u201c\u2018no person\u2019 shall \u2018import or commit to import\u2019 power from a large new energy facility located \u2018outside the state\u2019\u201d on Dormant Commerce Clause grounds).[\/footnote] But for now, courts have sided with the states. One New York case brought against RGGI on Compact Clause grounds settled;[footnote]See Consent Decree, Indeck Corinth, L.P. v. Paterson, No. 5280-09 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Dec. 23, 2009) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); Christopher Rizzo, Cap-and-Trade Under Attack Around the Nation, GreenLaw Blog (June 29, 2011), http:\/\/greenlaw.blogs.pace.edu\/2011\/06\/29\/cap-and-trade-under-attack-around-the-nation [http:\/\/perma.cc\/TS9E-AA6N] (providing a report of the settlement).[\/footnote] another was thrown out on procedural grounds.[footnote]Thrun v. Cuomo, 976 N.Y.S.2d 320, 322 (Sup. Ct. 2013) (dismissing the case because \u201ccertain claims are time-barred and the remaining claims have been rendered moot\u201d).[\/footnote] New England\u2019s regional REC scheme recently received substantial validation on Dormant Commerce Clause grounds, in the same Second Circuit opinion that upheld the state\u2019s renewables procurement regime.[footnote]Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 86\u201387 (2d Cir. 2017). Plaintiffs alleged that the New England regional REC-sharing program harmed their interests in a Georgia solar facility, which was not allowed to sell RECs to Connecticut utilities for purposes of RPS compliance. The Second Circuit found no merit in this contention, determining that a Georgia REC and a New England REC are in fact \u201cdifferent products\u201d that can legally be treated differently. Id. at 103. Underlying this finding was the recognition that \u201cConnecticut consumers\u2019 need for a more diversified and renewable energy supply, acces\u00adsible to them directly through their regional grid or indirectly through adjacent control areas, would not be served by RECs produced\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. in Georgia.\u201d Id. at 105.[\/footnote] With these holdings in place, both a regional cap-and-trade program and a regional market for RECs appear to stand on relatively firm legal ground. Of course, it could still come to pass that RPS programs themselves get struck down or that another circuit ana\u00adlyzes regional RECs\u2019 constitutionality differently. But the legal risk inher\u00adent in pursuing these types of regional solutions comes for states with an attendant gain\u2014not having to relinquish public control over the course and content of these important decarbonization programs.\r\n<h3>C. Designing Markets to Accommodate, Rather than Achieve, State Policies<\/h3>\r\nThe problem, of course, with pursuing regional solutions outside markets is that it returns the states to the problem animating current dis\u00adputes: the fact that extra-market solutions, whether pursued at the regional or state level, may distort and ultimately dismantle electricity markets.[footnote]See supra section I.C.[\/footnote] Here, then, a separate set of proposals for how to manage these concerns is salient. While many are deep in exploration of how to use electricity markets to <em>achieve<\/em> decarbonization, there is a second strand of proposed reforms that would focus on redesigning electricity markets not to subsume state climate policies but merely to <em>accommodate <\/em>them. Such accommodation would require regional markets to embrace the coexistence of manifold state policies in a way that has not always been the case to date and to intentionally mold their rules to support the con\u00adtinued viability of markets in the face of these state policies.[footnote]To be fair, regions have already been doing some accommodation for years, through policies such as exemptions from the \u201cminimum offer price rule,\u201d Kavulla, supra note 56, which requires that \u201cnew generators bid\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. at or above a specified price in certain circumstances,\u201d Rossi, Brave New Path, supra note 36, at 424. See also N.J. Bd. of Pub. Utils. v. FERC, 744 F.3d 74, 85\u201386, 93\u201394 (3d Cir. 2014) (describing the minimum offer price rule and upholding PJM\u2019s determination not to exempt state-supported resources from it any longer). But the current suite of accommodations is clearly inade\u00adquate, given the worries documented about wholesale market interference in this Article.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere are many ideas about how markets might be refined to better accommodate state climate policies, and most proposals tend to be quite technical. The basic idea behind them, though, is this: Regions should identify what current market signals are failing to achieve, and rework the market construct to achieve these aims. That might be through pric\u00ading some \u201cattribute\u201d of electricity that markets do not currently value\u2014for example, markets might pay generators for their ability to \u201cramp\u201d up and down quickly to balance out renewables.[footnote]MISO and CAISO have introduced \u201cramping products,\u201d which compensate resources for their ability to ramp up and down quickly.

A frank reckoning with exactly what \u201cresilience\u201d services are lacking from the grid and what resources and investments might pro\u00advide them should help regions determine if there is some \u201cresiliency attribute\u201d that markets currently undervalue and whether there is a mar\u00adket-grounded methodology for rewarding any resources that provide that value.[footnote]The comments of bipartisan former FERC commissioners on the DOE NOPR make a similar suggestion:\r\n\"We strongly encourage the Commission to use this opportunity created by the Secretary to identify attributes of the current competitive market system that need to be improved, to crisply define them and either modify the current published proposal or initiate regional proceedings to examine resilience issues and consider the need for market rule changes.\"\r\nBipartisan Former FERC Commissioners, Comments on Proposed Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule, FERC Docket No. RM18-1-000, at 7 (Oct. 19, 2017), http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/dive_static\/paychek\/Comments_of_BFFC_Docket_RM18-1_1.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/8B34-GQV3].[\/footnote] If pursued in this manner, an RTO\u2019s creation of an additional revenue stream for currently undervalued \u201cresiliency\u201d characteristics could help offset any resilience challenges that state-supported renewa\u00adbles might pose for the grid.[footnote]Note that there is substantial disagreement as to whether renewables do in fact destabilize the grid. Many believe that state-supported renewables might actually enhance grid resiliency. See, e.g., Order Terminating Rulemaking Proceeding, Initiating New Proceeding, and Establishing Additional Procedures, 162 FERC \u00b6 61,012, 2018 WL 345249, at *15 (Glick, Comm\u2019r, concurring).[\/footnote] At the same time, such a reform would not undermine state climate change goals and programs by selectively providing payments to the most carbon-polluting resource in the market: coal.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s proposed Grid Resilience Pricing Rule thus provides a sort of crossroads that underscores this Article\u2019s argu\u00adment about why states should be cautious in ceding decarbonization to RTOs. At best, FERC may use the proposed rule as a jumping-off point for redesigning markets in a way that truly helps RTOs better accommo\u00addate state climate change policies. If this path is taken, then state and regional policies will cause less friction for markets going forward\u2014ren\u00addering robust state decarbonization policies less problematic. At worst, certain RTOs might use the proposed rule as an invitation to create their own subsidy schemes aimed at propping up aging coal and nuclear for reasons unrelated to climate change aims\u2014and in large part, in direct contravention of them.[footnote]For example, in November 2017, the mid-Atlantic RTO, PJM, proposed a \u201cprice reformation\u201d program that would allow for \u201cinflexible\u201d (that is, slow-ramping) units to set the market price so as to better reflect \u201cthe true incremental cost to serve load.\u201d PJM, Proposed Enhancements to Energy Price Formation 1\u20132 (2017), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pjm.com\/-\/media\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/20171115-proposed-enhancements-to-energy-price-formation.ashx\">http:\/\/www.pjm.com\/-\/\r\nmedia\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/20171115-proposed-enhancements-to-energy-price-formation.ashx<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/HQ9P-NPBA] (defining \u201cinflexible units\u201d as \u201cthose with declining average costs that are unable to economically produce power within a certain range or that require an economic minimum output\u201d). This proposal is more market oriented than the DOE-proposed rule, but it still differentiates resources based on \u201cinflexibility\u201d in ways that do not appear fully justified. PJM\u2019s own market moni\u00adtor opposes the proposal. See Catherine Tyler, Valuing Inflexibility Undermines Energy Price Formation, Monitoring Analytics 7\u20138 (2017), http:\/\/www.monitoringanalytics.com\/reports\/\r\nPresentations\/2017\/IMM_PJM_Energy%20Policy_Roundtable_Valuing_Inflexibility_\r\nUndermines_Energy_Price_Formation_20170927.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/YTN4-PHHX].[\/footnote] If this path is pursued, then states will likely be glad not to have even partially ceded the goal of decarbonization to these markets, only to have them work to actively undermine it.\r\n\r\nThese concerns\u2014that RTOs and their participating states might end up with competing objectives\u2014highlight another potential avenue of reform. Twenty-odd years ago, FERC created RTOs as a grand experi\u00adment in new ways to manage electricity.[footnote]See Regional Transmission Organizations, 65 Fed. Reg. 810, 811 (Dec. 20, 1999) (codified at 18 C.F.R. pt. 35) (establishing RTOs).[\/footnote] But we have moved beyond the early, experimental stage of RTOs\u2019 existence. If their initial governance structures turn out not to serve states well, perhaps it is time to consider not only tweaking market design to accommodate state policies but also more dramatically reforming RTO governance itself. There is not enough space in this section to consider the possibilities and practicalities of pursuing these larger reforms, but hopefully the concerns raised here will prompt fur\u00adther inquiries in this vein.\r\n<h3>B. But What About the Laggards?<\/h3>\r\nThis Article focuses on a conundrum facing states that are leading the way in addressing climate change, arguing that they should cling to the right to shape their decarbonization trajectories. In articulating this argument, this Article has attempted to sketch the ways in which decar\u00adbonization is a \u201csocial\u201d project, requiring care in crafting its contours rather than merely its end game.\r\n\r\nBut the primary problem confronting state climate change policy today isn\u2019t the underappreciated \u201csocial nature\u201d of decarbonization. The bigger problem is the fact that a good many citizens\u2014and state govern\u00adments\u2014deny the existence of climate change and refuse to do much of anything to promote decarbonization. Laggard states not only do little to address climate change within their own boundaries but also actively impede efforts at federal climate change policies.[footnote]See, e.g., Samantha Page, 26 Attorneys General Are Suing the EPA. The Public Only Agrees with Them in 3 States, ThinkProgress (Nov. 3, 2015), <a href=\"http:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/26-attorneys-general-are-suing-the-epa-the-public-only-agrees-with-them-in-3-states-e935d36e42ba\">http:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/\r\n26-attorneys-general-are-suing-the-epa-the-public-only-agrees-with-them-in-3-states-e935d36e42ba<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/M9F6-U7D9] (providing a map of the twenty-six states suing the Environmental Protection Agency to halt implementation of the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d to address greenhouse gas emissions).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFor those who care about action on climate change, then, this Article\u2019s argument that we should leave states to shape their own policies might seem to create a critical downside: Leaving the aims of energy pol\u00adicy to state legislators and regulators means accepting whatever ends they democratically determine, be they climate change goals or coal mine job preservation goals. Such risks are not hypothetical: Ohio has already pur\u00adsued efforts to provide supplementary ratepayer funds to several coal plants at risk of retirement,[footnote]See Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. AEP Generation Res., Inc., 155 FERC \u00b6 61,102 (Apr. 27, 2016), 2016 WL 1717028, at *11\u201312 (rejecting an attempt by Ohio generators to pass through the costs of supporting certain in-state coal generation to captive ratepayers).[\/footnote] and there is considerable interest under the present Administration in protecting \u201cbaseload power\u201d from renewa\u00adble energy.[footnote]See Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 46,940, 46,941\u201345 (Oct. 10, 2017) (to be codified at 18 C.F.R. pt. 35).[\/footnote] This interest may prompt more states to enact policies that seek to support not particular clean-energy sources but particular <em>dirty<\/em>-energy sources.[footnote]See Kavulla, supra note 56 (observing that such state laws \u201care proliferat\u00ading, and they are not limited to renewables but whatever a legislature might prefer\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSuch is these states\u2019 right in a federalist system with no overarching federal climate policy.[footnote]Of course, should the Clean Power Plan\u2014the Obama-era regulation that sets greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets for each state\u2014ultimately persist, it will act as a \u201cfloor\u201d below which no state can go in terms of climate change policy. See Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units, 80 Fed. Reg. 64,662, 64,662 (Oct. 23, 2015) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. pt. 60). The D.C. Circuit is currently entertaining a challenge to the regulations, which President Trump has announced his ambition to withdraw. See Order at 2, West Virginia v. EPA, No. 15-1363 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28, 2017) (granting a sixty-day stay of litigation); Exec. Order No. 13,783, 82 Fed. Reg. 16,093, 16,094\u201396 (Mar. 31, 2017) (mandating the suspension, revi\u00adsion, or rescission of numerous federal climate change reform plans).[\/footnote] This state schism on climate change thus creates a powerful argument in favor of federal action, which could bind all states to achieving progress on decarbonization.[footnote]See Jonathan B. Wiener, Think Globally, Act Globally: The Limits of Local Climate Policies, 155 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1961, 1962 (2007) (\u201c[S]ubnational state-level action is not the best way to combat global climate change. This is true even assuming that fore\u00adstalling global climate change is of utmost importance, and even where the state-level poli\u00adcies are individually well designed.\u201d).[\/footnote] But these arguments are orthogonal to this Article\u2019s inquiry, which is of a narrower scope: Given the fact that no federal climate policy is likely to be forthcoming soon, should states seeking to decarbonize work together through their regional electricity markets to do so?\r\n\r\nUsing RTOs to address decarbonization simply does not have the same power to pull along laggard states. Because of RTOs\u2019 voluntary membership and stakeholder-governance processes, laggard states would be perfectly capable of blocking any RTO decarbonization proposals that required them to go above and beyond on climate.[footnote]See supra sections III.B\u2013.C.[\/footnote] And even if a region were to figure out a way to allow certain of its members to pursue decarbonization goals absent full regional participation,[footnote]Cf. PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives, supra note 190, at 2 (proposing that a subregion of states within PJM could pursue carbon pricing, although these might have to be contiguous states).[\/footnote] such cooperative action would not stop other states in the region from pursuing poli\u00adcies aimed at propping up carbon-intensive resources.[footnote]There might be a legal differentiation, however, between state policies aimed at decarbonizing and state policies aimed specifically at keeping old plants from retiring simply to preserve jobs and economic benefits to the state. The latter type of state policy might be more vulnerable to a Dormant Commerce Clause challenge than state envi\u00adronmental initiatives. Cf. Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, Nos. 17-cv-01163 &amp; 17-cv-01164, 2017 WL 3008289, at *16 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017) (accepting the environmental purpose of Illinois\u2019s ZEC program but hinting that a program aimed exclusively at in-state economic benefits would be vulnerable on these grounds).[\/footnote] Accordingly, although state polarization argues for <em>federal <\/em>action, it does not lend force to pro\u00adposals to regionalize decarbonization policy through electric\u00adity markets.[footnote]Unless, of course, a laggard state is willing to up its ambition as a condition of other states proceeding through the market construct\u2014a contingency accounted for in my three variables. See supra section IV.A.[\/footnote]\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nScholars, regulators, and market participants all recognize that elec\u00adtricity markets, in their current form, do not incentivize the rapid decar\u00adbonization of the electricity sector necessary to respond to climate change, thereby forcing states to act on their own. This realization has provoked conversations at FERC, at RTOs, and among states as to whether these markets should be redesigned to accomplish states\u2019 cli\u00admate change goals. This Article has questioned the use of redesigned electricity markets as a driver of decarbonization in the United States. In particular, this Article has pointed out the ways in which decarbonizing electricity is a social project that should be managed by politically accountable entities, working through public processes capable of chan\u00adneling and incorporating numerous goals related to decarbonization.\r\n\r\nThose who are committed exclusively to the most rapid decarboniza\u00adtion possible are unlikely to be persuaded by this argument. It is true that in the present political climate, using electricity markets to respond to climate change would be an expedient and efficient pathway forward. Nevertheless, this Article has highlighted the risks that attend expedi\u00adency. If climate change policy is shunted into these markets rather than left open for public debate, states will have lost a significant amount of control over <em>how <\/em>decarbonization proceeds. Instead, these decisions will be made in quasi-private governance institutions with complex voting rules and opaque power structures, under murky jurisdictional bounda\u00adries that may make it hard for states to assert concordant control.\r\n\r\nThe technical intricacies inherent in discussions over integrating cli\u00admate policies and regional electricity markets often drive participants to put aside larger questions regarding the animating forces of climate pol\u00adicy\u2014at great peril. Debates over using electricity markets to accomplish decarbonization should in fact highlight the question of why climate change is a problem in the first place. After all, civilizations have crumbled and species have gone extinct due to climatic changes.[footnote]See Jared Diamond, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed 77\u2013308 (2005) (documenting and theorizing the collapse of many past societies); Elizabeth Kolbert, The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History 101\u201304 (2014).[\/footnote] For many, the answer to this question is that the continued peaceful existence of humans on Earth\u2014and the minimization of their suffering\u2014is a worthy aim.[footnote]See Dale Jamieson, Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle Against Climate Change Failed\u2014And What It Means for Our Future 164\u201367, 179 (2014) (exploring this rationale for climate action and the challenges it presents for \u201ccommonsense\u201d morality and concluding that the task at hand is \u201cto live in productive relationship with the dynamic systems that govern a changing planet\u201d); see also Steven C.

L. Rev. 277, 298\u201399 (2017) [hereinafter Ross, Carbon Taxation] (noting that various approaches to inter\u00adnal subsidies \u201cfall considerably short of the efficiency and social-welfare benefits that a carbon tax could provide\u201d).[\/footnote] Instead, states have crafted schemes that help them manage the contours, aims, and consequences of decarbonization. These state policies include requirements that utilities buy certain amounts and types of renewable energy, incentives for communities to build their own solar farms, payments to aging (and appealingly carbon-free) nuclear power plants to keep them from retiring, and complete redesign of state electricity law.[footnote]See infra section I.B.[\/footnote] These various policies combine decarbo\u00adnization with aims ranging from job creation and economic development to income redis\u00adtribution, urban revitalization, open-space preservation, and the continu\u00adation of traditional livelihoods.[footnote]See infra sections I.B, II.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a potential downside to this rich set of state climate policies. As state ambitions ramp up, complications with this state-by-state approach to decarbonizing electricity become more apparent. States share jurisdiction over electricity with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).[footnote]See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824(b) (2012) (providing federal jurisdiction over \u201cthe transmis\u00adsion of electric energy in interstate commerce and to the sale of electric energy at whole\u00adsale in interstate commerce,\u201d but otherwise reserving authority for states). For more detail, see infra Part I.[\/footnote] In most of the country, states have ceded partial control over electricity supply to regional electricity-market operators, which are \u201chybrid\u201d quasi-private, quasi-governmental entities, comprised of industry members functioning under FERC oversight.[footnote]See Hari M. Osofsky &amp; Hannah J. Wiseman, Hybrid Energy Governance, 2014 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1, 6 (describing how \u201cthe tripartite energy system [of physical, regulatory, and market components] involve[s] numerous public and private stakeholders at multiple levels of government\u201d). Electricity-market structures are discussed in sections I.A and III.B.[\/footnote] These electri\u00adcity markets are designed to select least-cost sources of electricity; they do not \u201cprice in\u201d carbon or otherwise favor carbon-free generation sources.[footnote]See infra note 55 and accompanying text (noting that electricity markets are designed for least-cost electricity and are therefore limited in accommodating other goals); see also infra text accompanying note 237 (describing the aims of a carbon-pricing scheme).[\/footnote] Consequently, many allege that state incentives and payment schemes targeted at particular low-carbon technologies inter\u00adfere with the smooth functioning of these regional markets.[footnote]See infra section I.C.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNow, faced with a growing number of divergent state policies, several regional market operators have accepted that electricity markets may need to play a more active role in decarbonization.[footnote]See infra sections I.C, III.A; see also William Boyd, Public Utility and the Low-Carbon Future, 61 UCLA L. Rev. 1614, 1686\u201387 (2014) (\u201cFrom a climate change perspec\u00adtive\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. the looming question is whether electricity markets can deliver significant carbon reductions over the next several decades.\u201d).[\/footnote] One key question under discussion is whether it is time to redesign electricity markets to achieve states\u2019 decarbonization goals.[footnote]Many people in this conversation distinguish between two ways that markets could be redesigned to support state climate policies. Markets could either be tweaked to <em>accommodate<\/em> state policies without attempting to supplant them, or markets could be used to <em>achieve<\/em> state climate goals. See Cheryl A.

For FERC\u2019s response, see infra notes 332\u2013334.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere is obvious appeal to using electricity markets to achieve state climate change goals. Integrating these goals into markets could lower the cost of decarbonizing energy, while eliminating the risk that accret\u00ading state policies might distort the functioning of electricity markets. For this reason, many stakeholders that often find themselves on opposite sides of energy policy debates have expressed support for integrating state climate policies into regional electricity markets.[footnote]Of note, several environmental not-for-profits find themselves aligned with fossil fuel generators on this topic. See infra Part III; see also Gavin Bade, The Carbon Consensus: Generators, Analysts Back CO2 Price at FERC Technical Conference, Util. Dive (May 3, 2017), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.utilitydive.com\/news\/the-carbon-consensus-generators-analysts-back-co2-price-at-ferc-technical\/441862\/\">http:\/\/www.utilitydive.com\/news\/the-carbon-consensus-generators-analysts-\r\nback-co2-price-at-ferc-technical\/441862\/<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/4F9N-UWNS] (\u201c[O]ne note\u00adworthy area of consensus emerged from nearly every corner of the diverse stakeholder group\u2014the need to price carbon in wholesale power markets.\u201d).[\/footnote] It can thus feel almost reflexively reactionary for anyone who supports rapid decarboni\u00adzation to resist such efforts.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this Article argues that states should exercise caution in ceding control over decarbonization too quickly or thoroughly to regional electricity markets. This argument is grounded in comparative institu\u00adtional competencies[footnote]See Neil K. Komesar, Imperfect Alternatives: Choosing Institutions in Law, Economics, and Public Policy 4\u20136 (1994) (arguing that \u201cdeciding who decides\u201d is a critical part of legal analysis and calling for greater attention to comparative institutional analysis).[\/footnote] and the importance of preserving state cen\u00adtrality in decisionmaking over decarbonization.[footnote]\u201cState\u201d in this context refers to government. This Article does not intend to make a federalism argument, but rather proceeds on the assumption that states will be the level of government that primarily addresses decarbonization for the next several years. See Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 278 (describing federal carbon tax legislation as \u201cinfeasible and\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. stalled, at least for the foreseeable future\u201d); see also infra section IV.D.[\/footnote] In short, states do a dis\u00adservice to current and future residents if they cede the shape of decarbonization policy to market insiders and experts rather than subject these policy decisions to wider democratic inquiry, debate, and decisionmaking.\r\n\r\nAlthough conversations about electricity markets and decarboniza\u00adtion can quickly alienate all but the most technocratic insiders, decarbon\u00adization is far more than a technical project. Decarbonization policies will determine how our society extracts, owns, sites, manages, moves, consumes, and conserves electricity in the future. Given electric\u00adity\u2019s centrality to modern life, such policies have the potential to radically alter political and economic power, as well as to shape the future of American land\u00adscapes, communities, and daily living arrangements.[footnote]See infra section II.A.[\/footnote] Decarbonization is thus a profoundly social project.[footnote]This point is well made outside the legal literature, see infra note 147, but its implications for climate law and policy are surprisingly undertheorized. In a forthcoming article, Professor Alice Kaswan explores how decarbonization\u2019s society-wide impacts might inform our understanding of the drawbacks of market-based mechanisms more generally, but she does not address the proposal to use regional electricity markets in particular. See Alice Kaswan, Energy, Governance, and Market Mechanisms, 72 Miami L. Rev. (forthcoming 2018) (manuscript at 1\u201311) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn crafting multifaceted, nuanced decarbonization policies, states are demonstrating their understanding of this fact. State climate policies reflect state preferences about <em>how <\/em>they decarbonize, instead of just <em>whether <\/em>they decarbonize. These diverse public preferences would be lost in the integration of state policy aims into regional electricity markets. This Article identifies three particular risks electricity markets present in this regard. The first is the loss of transparent, government-driven deci\u00adsionmaking on the trajectory of decarbonization. Electricity markets are governed through quasi-private, immensely technocratic, and largely opaque processes[footnote]See infra section III.A.[\/footnote]\u2014hardly the space in which we should center debates over the shape of decarbonization. The second risk is one of homogeni\u00adzation to the lowest common denominator. Electricity-market design lim\u00adits the tools with which states can respond to decarbonization, requiring states to homogenize their preferences. In practice, such homogeniza\u00adtion is likely to water down more ambitious state policies to achieve the near-consensus buy-in of states and stakeholders required in regional electricity-market governance.\r\n\r\nThe final risk to electricity-market integration of state climate poli\u00adcies stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2016 decision in <em>Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC<\/em>.[footnote]136 S. Ct. 1288 (2016).[\/footnote] There, the Supreme Court placed limits on states\u2019 abilities to adopt policies that regulate electricity in ways too closely linked to federally overseen markets.[footnote]Id. at 1299.[\/footnote] Although <em>Hughes <\/em>left open significant questions regarding how much overlap there can be between regional-market functions and state policy aims, it creates legal risk around any state decision to cede decarbonization goals to the markets.[footnote]See infra section III.B.[\/footnote] Once a state gives control over a particular function\u2014like decarboniza\u00adtion\u2014to its regional market, it may diminish the set of tools that it can use at the state level to accomplish the same policy aim.\r\n\r\nArticulating these reasons for caution does not mean that states should resist all efforts to integrate decarbonization aims into regional electricity markets. Instead, these risks point to a series of conclusions about when market integration of state climate policies is advisable and how it might best proceed. First, states might prefer using regional elec\u00adtricity markets as a climate tool when their objective is the cheapest decar\u00adbonization possible, without regard for what resources the market selects or where these resources are located. In contrast, if a state has resource preferences, distributional goals, or other objectives related to <em>how <\/em>decar\u00adbonization proceeds, markets will prove inapt tools. For these states, market integration may prove advisable only if the particular mar\u00adket reform selected allows states leeway to adjust their preferences and factor them into the market design.[footnote]Part IV explains how certain market reforms might allow for this more easily than others.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, the regional politics of decarbonization should inform state decisions. U.S. states diverge considerably in the ambition of their climate policies, from states pledging to go \u201c100% renewable\u201d to states focused on perpetuating U.S. coal consumption.[footnote]For a catalog of some of the most ambitious state renewable energy targets, see generally infra notes 87\u201388. For state support of coal, see generally Kathiann M. Kowalski, As Ohio Legislature Regroups, Power Plant Subsidy Debate to Continue, Midwest Energy News (Aug. 16, 2017), http:\/\/midwestenergynews.com\/2017\/08\/16\/as-ohio-legislature-regroups-power-plant-subsidy-debate-continues\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/88NJ-RATC] (detailing legislative efforts in Ohio to provide subsidies to \u201c1950s-era coal plants\u201d and nuclear generation).[\/footnote] As this Article explains, the struc\u00adture of U.S. electricity law leaves regional market enti\u00adties without the authority to mandate that recalcitrant states adopt more aggressive cli\u00admate policies.[footnote]See infra section IV.C.[\/footnote] Nevertheless, perhaps there is still some bargaining power inherent in the regional market construct, such that states aggressive on climate change might use market solutions to coax along less willing regional neighbors. The greater the likelihood of such persuasion suc\u00adceeding, the more appealing a market-based solution should be.[footnote]See infra section IV.A.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFinally, the appeal of integrating state policies into regional markets might shift over time as courts flesh out the boundaries of the <em>Hughes<\/em> deci\u00adsion and related cases.[footnote]See infra section III.C.[\/footnote] Because of these variables at play, the ques\u00adtion of how to manage the intersection of state policies and regional electricity markets is likely to be a dynamic and region-specific one. Nevertheless, there is value in understanding at the outset of these conversations the risks that the marketization of state climate policies presents to the multi\u00adfaceted project of decarbonization. Only states ready to relinquish control over their decarbonization trajectory in exchange for cost effectiveness should embrace market integration proposals as they stand now.\r\n\r\nMost scholarly analysis of these proposed electricity-market reforms has focused on the jurisdictional questions they present. Regional elec\u00adtricity-market operators are constrained by the Federal Power Act\u2019s man\u00addate that federally overseen markets ensure \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates.[footnote]See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824d (2012).[\/footnote] Whether integrating decarbonization goals falls within this mandate is a thorny legal question, and many prominent energy law scholars are puz\u00adzling through this jurisdictional morass.[footnote]See 2 Steven Weissman &amp; Romany Webb, Berkeley Ctr. for Law, Energy &amp; the Env\u2019t, Addressing Climate Change Without Legislation: FERC \u00a7\u00a03.1 (2014), http:\/\/\r\nwww.law.berkeley.edu\/files\/CLEE\/FERC_Report_FINAL.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/5XE7-R4Q7] (\u201cIn addition to considering . . . supplier and customer interests, FERC\u2019s rate\u00admaking must also protect the general public interest.\u201d); Christopher J.

Rev. 399, 403 (2016) [hereinafter Rossi, Brave New Path].[\/footnote] This Article frames these debates differently, highlighting the ways in which they implicate long-standing institutional design choices between complex, heavily managed market constructs and more direct regulatory control by states.[footnote]Professor William Boyd began an evocative exploration of these themes in <em>Public Utility and the Low-Carbon Future<\/em>, in which he argues that electricity markets are part of \u201ca broader understanding of public utility\u201d and should be harnessed to normative ends. Boyd, supra note 15, at 1673. Boyd\u2019s analysis frames but does not answer the question tack\u00adled here\u2014how, within this normative project, states should weigh the relative merits of using markets or regulation to accomplish their decarbonizing aims. Professor Jim Rossi has similarly reframed the conversation by identifying ways in which state decarbonization policies resemble \u201ccarbon taxation by regulation.\u201d See Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 279\u201380. Rossi\u2019s focus, however, is on how these regulatory instruments can be made to resemble market mechanisms\u2014a line of inquiry that deviates substantially from my own. See id.; see also infra note 170. Professor David B. Spence also has insightful broader work on these themes. See generally David B. Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets, 92 Notre Dame L. Rev. 973 (2017) [hereinafter, Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets] (explaining how \u201cenergy markets can never resemble the idealized markets of economic theory that have become so popular in conservative policy discourse\u201d).[\/footnote] Framing the issue in this way lends relevance to a separate genre of scholarship, focused on questions of how markets, public policy, and values inter\u00adsect.[footnote]See infra Part II. See generally Frank Ackerman &amp; Lisa Heinzerling, Priceless: On Knowing the Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing (2005) (criticizing the assign\u00adment of monetary values to public health and environmental resources); Douglas A.

Decarbonization might radically redistribute wealth and power in U.S. society, or it might largely maintain the status quo while shifting only behind-the-scenes fuel choices.[footnote]See infra section II.A.[\/footnote] State policies reflect and embody this contest while regional markets present a homog\u00adenizing and privatizing force that narrows the room in which to debate the many shapes a decarbonized society might take.\r\n\r\nThis Article proceeds in four parts. Part I gives an overview of regional electricity markets, state climate change policies, and their inter\u00adsections. Part II explores the nature of the project of decarbonization, illus\u00adtrating how state climate policies embody diverse preferences and values that reflect an understanding of the significant choices at hand. Part III shows how electricity-market redesign might eliminate these democrat\u00adically determined value choices embedded in state climate poli\u00adcies, laying out the challenges that result from using the peculiar governance structures of electricity markets to carry out decarbonization. Part IV presents lessons derived from this analysis for when states might pre\u00adfer or resist market integration of their decarbonization goals.\r\n<h2>I. The Current Mesh and Clash of Regional Electricity Markets and State Climate Policies<\/h2>\r\nTo understand the debates about decarbonization roiling electricity regulation, one has to begin with a foundation in the structure of elec\u00adtricity policy and electricity markets. This Part provides an overview of regional electricity markets, state climate policies, and their potentially troubling intersections.\r\n<h3>A. Electricity Markets<\/h3>\r\nElectricity governance in the United States is a patchwork affair, tak\u00ading on various forms across states and regions that defy quick summa\u00adtion.[footnote]Cf.

Joskow, Markets for Power in the United States: An Interim Assessment, 27 Energy J. 1, 4 (2006) (describing U.S. restructuring as occurring without \u201ca clear coherent blueprint,\u201d unlike in other countries).[\/footnote] This patchwork quality stems from the Federal Power Act of 1935, which divides jurisdiction over electricity in the United States. The fed\u00aderal government\u2014acting via FERC\u2014has jurisdiction over \u201cthe sale of [electric] energy at wholesale,\u201d which comprises sales from electricity generators to the utilities that own the transmission and distribution grid that carries that electricity to end-use consumers.[footnote]16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0824(a), (b)(1) (2012).[\/footnote] States retain control over \u201cretail sales\u201d of electricity\u2014sales that these utilities make to consumers.[footnote]Id. \u00a7\u00a0824(b)(1).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFrom 1935 until the 1990s, FERC had a fairly straightforward role in electricity regulation. Most utilities owned their own generation resources that they used to supply their retail customers, such that there were rela\u00adtively few \u201cwholesale transactions\u201d of electricity to regulate.[footnote]Paul L.

In these regions, generators can sell power either through bilateral contracts or through centralized electricity mar\u00adkets administered by RTOs.[footnote]See Emily Hammond &amp; David B. Spence, The Regulatory Contract in the Marketplace, 69 Vand. L. Rev. 141, 154 (2016). Markets for electricity operate on both a day-ahead and a real-time basis, with the latter market making up for any imbalances in supply and demand that occur close to the time of electricity delivery. Id. Bilateral con\u00adtracting continues to make up a sizeable portion of electricity sales even in RTO regions. See, e.g., Collin Cain &amp; Jonathan Lesser, Bates White Econ.

However, as was the case nationwide prerestructuring, its jurisdiction extends to fewer transactions in these regions.[\/footnote] means that states deciding whether to join RTOs face a choice between these unusual mar\u00adkets and more traditional regulation.[footnote]Note that these \u201cmarkets\u201d themselves require substantial regulatory oversight of more novel varieties.

Rev. 311 (2012) [hereinafter Davies, Reconciling] (arguing states should blend both renewable portfolio standards and feed-in tariffs in designing their renewable-energy policies).[\/footnote] Instead, this section examines three popular state climate policies that have been the most controversial for the ways in which they intersect with regional electricity markets: renewable portfolio standards, direct pro\u00adcurement orders, and \u201czero-emissions credits\u201d for nuclear generators.\r\n\r\nRenewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs) are one of the most popular state tools for promoting low-carbon energy sources. Twenty-nine states currently have an RPS in place.[footnote]Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies, Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency, N.C. Clean Energy Tech. Ctr. (2017) [hereinafter Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies], <a href=\"http:\/\/ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Renewable-Portfolio-Standards.pdf\">http:\/\/ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/\r\n2017\/03\/Renewable-Portfolio-Standards.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/6ZMN-GZEE].[\/footnote] These laws require[footnote]Eight additional states have renewable portfolio \u201cgoals\u201d but not requirements. Id.[\/footnote] utilities in the state to source a certain percentage of the electricity that they sell from renew\u00adable sources by a certain date.[footnote]Mormann, supra note 36, at 1624. In some cases, state law specifies an absolute quantity. See, e.g., Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies, supra note 81 (showing Texas with an RPS of 5,880 megawatts by 2015).[\/footnote] This approach enables utilities to seek out the cheapest renewable energy available to satisfy the state mandate.[footnote]Lincoln L. Davies, Power Forward: The Argument for a National RPS, 42 Conn. L. Rev. 1339, 1357 (2010) [hereinafter Davies, Power Forward].[\/footnote] Typically, states track compliance with their RPS by issuing \u201cRenewable Energy Credits\u201d (RECs) to renewable energy generators, which utilities then purchase to prove that the requisite share of their energy has come from renewable sources.[footnote]Id. at 1359\u201360; see also Todd Jones et al., Ctr. for Res. Sols., The Legal Basis for Renewable Energy Certificates 3 (2015) (\u201cThirty-six (36) U.S. states and territories recog\u00adnize that RECs can be used to track and transact renewable electricity on the grid.\u201d). REC trading is often limited to either in-state or in-region. Cf. Robin Kundis Craig, Constitutional Contours for the Design and Implementation of Multistate Renewable Energy Programs and Projects, 81 U. Colo. L. Rev. 771, 795 (2010) (\u201c[A]t the state level, RPS requirements that favor instate RECs or forbid out-of-state RECs could run afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause. Similarly, multistate agreements that allow REC trading within the consortium but prohibit RECs from other states could raise constitutional concerns.\u201d).[\/footnote] RECs thus help create a more liquid market for renewable energy by allowing the \u201crenewable\u201d attribute to be sold separately from the underlying energy.[footnote]Joel H. Mack et al., All RECs Are Local: How In-State Generation Requirements Adversely Affect Development of a Robust REC Market, Elec. J., May 2011, at 8, 10; see also Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 92\u201393 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining RECs); Kelly Crandall, Comment, Trust and the Green Consumer: The Fight for Accountability in Renewable Energy Credits, 81 U. Colo. L. Rev. 893, 904 (2010) (same). FERC has explicitly endorsed the existence of RECs as creations of state law that can legally exist apart from the underlying electricity bought and sold. See WSPP Inc., 139 FERC \u00b6 61,061 (Apr. 20, 2012), 2012 WL 1395532, at *5.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn the most ambitious states, RPSs require a substantial percentage of renewables: In New York and California, this percentage is 50% by 2030; in Vermont, 75% by 2032.[footnote]Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies, supra note 81. Direct comparison of these standards can be challenging\u2014one must know precisely what resources are included, whether or not renewables that existed before passage of the RPS are included, and what the natural resource endowment of the state is like. See Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1361.[\/footnote] In 2015, Hawaii adopted a 100% target by 2045.[footnote]Act of June 8, 2015, 2015 Haw. Sess.

Util. Rep. 4th (PUR) 414 (N.Y. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n 2004) (defining eligible resources as biogas (including anaerobic digestion and landfill gas), biomass, fuel cells, hydro (without new storage impoundment), solar, tidal\/ocean, and wind).[\/footnote] and other times more conceptually. For example, Vermont\u2019s definition of renewables includes any \u201ctechnol\u00adogy that relies on a resource that is being consumed at a harvest rate at or below its natural regeneration rate.\u201d[footnote]Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, \u00a7\u00a08002(21) (2016).[\/footnote] Some states use these schemes to express more idiosyncratic preferences tailored to local conditions.[footnote]See Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1360\u201362 (discussing differences in terms of four core RPS design traits); Steven Ferrey et al., Fire and Ice: World Renewable Energy and Carbon Control Mechanisms Confront Constitutional Barriers, 20 Duke Envtl. L. &amp; Pol\u2019y F. 125, 144\u201350 (2010) (cataloguing different state RPSs).[\/footnote] Maryland, for instance, includes electricity produced from chicken manure in its RPS, while North Carolina includes electricity from hog waste.[footnote]See Md. Code Ann., Pub. Util. \u00a7\u00a07-701(j), (m) (LexisNexis 2016) (defining poul\u00adtry litter, which is used in thermal biomass systems); N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a062-133.8(e) (2015) (establishing a specific requirement for swine waste).[\/footnote] Numerous states also establish \u201ctiers\u201d or \u201ccarve-outs\u201d within their RPSs, which mandate a certain amount of the overall requirement to come from particular resource types. Twenty-two of the twenty-nine states with RPSs have a carve-out relating either to solar energy or \u201cdistributed gener\u00adation\u201d\u2014a term used to describe small-scale generating resources located at or near the site of consumption.[footnote]Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) with Solar or Distributed Generation Provisions, Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency, N.C.

See Davies, Reconciling, supra note 80, at 313 (discussing how RPSs and other incen\u00adtives can complement each other); Mormann, supra note 36, at 1658\u201359 (proposing a model for integrating RPSs and feed-in tariffs). As Davies and Mormann explain, RPS and procurement policies can be blended to create, on the one hand, substantial demand for renewable energy and, on the other hand, assurance to investors of certain returns over a longer period of time. Davies, Reconciling, supra note 80, at 314; Mormann, supra note 36, at 1628.[\/footnote] For example, in 2016, Massachusetts passed \u201cAn Act Relative to Energy Diversity,\u201d which requires utilities in the state to enter into long-term con\u00adtracts for 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind energy.[footnote]An Act to Promote Energy Diversity, 2016 Mass.

New York pioneered this strategy with its Public Service Commission\u2019s 2016 decision to provide payments, per megawatt hour, to three nuclear units in New York State that it determined were at risk of retiring without state aid.[footnote]See N.Y.

First, though, it is helpful to understand the problems that detractors believe these state policies present to regional electricity markets.\r\n<h3>C. Tensions at the Intersection<\/h3>\r\nState climate policies and regional electricity markets have coex\u00adisted\u2014and indeed, grown together\u2014for around two decades.[footnote]See Tierney, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 52, at 2 (observing the prev\u00adalence of state policies that can affect wholesale market prices); see also Robert Klee, Comm\u2019r, Conn.

Regional market operator PJM\u2014an RTO that spans the mid-Atlantic\u2014offers perhaps the most parsimonious explanation for the present spate of concern: \u201cSubsidies are contagious.\u201d[footnote]Monitoring Analytics, LLC, State of the Market Report for PJM, Volume 2: Detailed Analysis 2 (2017) [hereinafter Monitoring Analytics, State of the Market Report], http:\/\/www.monitoringanalytics.com\/reports\/PJM_State_of_the_Market\/2016\/2016-som-pjm-volume2.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/UAJ9-YY3A]. [\/footnote] By \u201csubsidies,\u201d PJM is ref\u00aderencing the myriad state policies detailed above that help pro\u00admote various clean-energy resources. As this quote suggests, regional electricity-market operators are nervous about the proliferation of these state-level, resource-specific policies as a means to achieve ambitious climate-mitigation goals.\r\n\r\nThe first common complaint about these state policies is that pay\u00adments to specific zero-carbon resources unfairly suppress market prices. For example, plaintiffs suing to contest the legality of New York\u2019s ZEC program explain their concerns as follows: Providing existing nuclear units an out-of-market ZEC payment enables these nuclear plants to lower the price at which they bid into the market.[footnote]See Complaint at 19\u201323, Coal. for Competitive Elec. v.

Going forward, states plan to continue to rely on these markets to send signals about whether and when to invest in new generating capacity in any particular region.

In these regions, states have largely required utilities to sell off their generation assets, such that corporations building generators do not have the benefit of a captive monopoly rate base[footnote]In regulated regions, approved capital expenditures make up a utility\u2019s \u201crate base.\u201d The utility is entitled to recover the costs reflected in the rate base as well as a reason\u00adable rate of return, typically around ten percent per year.

Preferences Beyond Least Cost<\/h2>\r\nAt one level, decarbonization is a technical challenge. To combat climate change, the amount of carbon released in the production of elec\u00adtricity must be dramatically reduced. Leading studies suggest that ade\u00adquately mitigating climate change\u2014that is, minimizing the possibility of planetary catastrophe\u2014will require \u201cdeep decarbonization\u201d of developed country economies.[footnote]The White House, United States Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization 6\u20137 (2016), http:\/\/unfccc.int\/files\/focus\/long-term_strategies\/application\/pdf\/mid_century_\r\nstrategy_report-final_red.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/DH3A-7YTM]; Williams et al., Deep Decarbonization Policy, supra note 6, at 11; see also John C.

These projects yield answers along the following lines: \u201cThe carbon intensity of electricity will need to be reduced by a startling 97%.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 49.[\/footnote] To do so, \u201c[p]etroleum, coal, and natu\u00adral gas [must] play a much smaller role in the primary energy supply,\u201d and \u201cwind, solar, biomass, and nuclear [must] become the dominant share of primary energy supply.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 19\u201320.[\/footnote] These changes will, of course, \u201cpro\u00adfoundly transform the U.S. energy economy.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 9.[\/footnote] A more interesting and open question, though, is how\u2014and how much\u2014these major infrastruc\u00adture changes will reverberate throughout the American economy and American society.\r\n<h3>A. Two Visions of the Decarbonized Future<\/h3>\r\nIt can be difficult to trace the ways in which discrete energy-infra\u00adstructure decisions affect larger social and political structures. It is often only in hindsight, after the gradual accretion of decades of such decisions, that we can understand how energy policies interrelate to larger ques\u00adtions of social structure and economic and political power.[footnote]For a powerful demonstration of these interlinkages, see generally Timothy Mitchell, Carbon Democracy: Political Power in the Age of Oil (2011), which traces the ways in which the switch from coal to oil as a dominant fuel impacted political economy and political institutions in the Western world.[\/footnote] But part of this Article\u2019s argument is that it is important to appreciate up front\u2014as best we can\u2014the expansive effects that our choices around <em>how <\/em>to decarbonize the energy system are likely to have.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to develop an appreciation of decarbonization\u2019s potentially widespread ramifications, this section asks the reader to con\u00adsider two divergent pathways to deep decarbonization. The first emerges from a recent, personal conversation with an acquaintance who works for a major environmental not-for-profit that will remain undisclosed.[footnote]That makes this anecdote hard to cite. But it is not particularly important that it can be externally validated\u2014it is offered in the spirit of exploring \u201csociotechnical imagi\u00adnaries,\u201d as described by the scholar of science, technology, and society, Professor Sheila Jasanoff. Sheila Jasanoff &amp; Sang-Hyun Kim, Sociotechnical Imaginaries and National Energy Policies, 22 Sci. as Culture 189, 190 (2013). These imaginaries, for Jasanoff, are \u201c\u2018collectively imagined forms of social life and social order reflected in the design and fulfillment of nation-specific scientific and\/or technological projects,\u2019\u201d as well as \u201cpowerful cultural resources that help shape social responses to innovation.\u201d Id. (quoting Sheila Jasanoff and Sang-Hyun Kim, Containing the Atom: Sociotechnical Imaginaries and Nuclear Power in the United States and South Korea, 47 Minerva 119, 120 (2009)); see also Charles Taylor, Modern Social Imaginaries 23 (2004) (defining \u201csocial imaginaries\u201d as \u201cthe ways people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations\u201d).[\/footnote] He explained that, frustrated with recent backsliding on climate change in the United States, his organization was quietly assembling a group of the major fossil fuel companies in an attempt to devise a response to climate change that would ensure that the companies maintained their domi\u00adnant role in the economy. That is to say, this group hoped to draft legisla\u00adtion related to decarbonization that would do as little as possible to shake up market shares, or political power, within the energy industry or beyond. In this group\u2019s view, accepting a policy actively designed to fore\u00adstall any significant distributional shifts is the surest way to achieve rapid deep decarbonization.\r\n\r\nIf this pathway were taken, the major political and economic players in the decarbonized future might not look so different from those of today\u2014many of the changes would play out behind the scenes of the electricity grid. All of us would get used to landscapes dotted by major utility-scale wind farms, nuclear power plants, solar arrays, and transmis\u00adsion lines, owned by companies like Exxon and BP.[footnote]Several of the big oil companies are already moving in this direction. See, e.g., Anna Hirtenstein, Big Oil Follows Silicon Valley into Backing Green Energy Firms, Bloomberg Tech.

The price of electricity would likely rise, but companies such as General Electric would provide new technologies to help control electric\u00adity demand\u2014technologies that would be available to those who could afford them.[footnote]See Shelley Welton, Clean Electrification, 88 U. Colo. L. Rev. 571, 591\u2013609 (2017) (exploring the trend toward creating a \u201cparticipatory grid\u201d and the equity challenges it presents).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nNow, consider a second, quite different pathway that a country or state could take toward decarbonization. This pathway emerges from the thesis of journalist Naomi Klein\u2019s 2014 book <em>This Changes Everything<\/em>.[footnote]Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate (2014).[\/footnote] In her view, the reason that the world has made so little progress on climate change is that \u201cthe Right is Right\u201d: Addressing climate change requires actions that \u201cdirectly challenge our reigning economic paradigm\u201d and \u201cspell extinction for the richest and most powerful industry the world has ever known\u2014the oil and gas industry.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 31, 63.[\/footnote] She doubts that any significant solution can be forged through cooperation with major corporations, citing the poor record of this strategy to date.[footnote]Id. at 207\u201349.[\/footnote] Instead, she sees the challenge of climate change as an opportunity to forge new grassroots alliances that link climate change to community health and that demand more democratic decisionmaking and local economic power.[footnote]See id. at 96\u201397, 360\u201361.[\/footnote] Climate change, in this view, \u201ccould be the catalyst to attack inequality at its core.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 409.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIf this pathway toward decarbonization were pursued, there might be an efflorescence of city movements to reclaim their electricity grids from private ownership.[footnote]See Shelley Welton, Public Energy, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 267, 304\u201307 (2017) [hereinafter Welton, Public Energy] (documenting efforts in this vein).[\/footnote] Communities would collectively invest in locally sited solar and wind farms, deciding to pay more to support local clean energy and local jobs. Consumption of energy and other goods might fall as the country pursued low-growth economic policies that focused on delivering free time instead of material accumulation, in an effort to spread fewer resources more broadly.[footnote]See, e.g., Tim Jackson, Prosperity Without Growth: Economics for a Finite Planet 3, 151, 180 (2011) (asking \u201c[w]hat can prosperity possibly look like in a finite world\u201d and concluding that it might include consuming less, improving social equality, and working fewer hours).[\/footnote] Significant lifestyle changes might be required, including reduced consumption of meat and dairy, less car ownership, and fewer airplane trips.[footnote]See Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth, Just Transition: Is a Just Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy Possible Within Safe Global Carbon Limits? 4 (2011), <a href=\"http:\/\/friendsoftheearth.uk\/sites\/default\/files\/downloads\/just_transition.pdf\">http:\/\/\r\nfriendsoftheearth.uk\/sites\/default\/files\/downloads\/just_transition.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\nH77H-FXET] (finding these sacrifices necessary if the United Kingdom were to meet decarbonization goals while ensuring that \u201cessential needs for housing, transport and energy use are met\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get much further apart than these two visions of the decarbonized future\u2014one based entirely on political expediency and maintenance of the economic order; the other based on a vision of using the project of decarbonization to radically restructure political and social relations. Their coexistence hints at the range of possibilities that decar\u00adbonization holds for power structures, community character, and daily life. No matter how we approach it, decarbonization will shape more than just physical infrastructure, making it a <em>social <\/em>project as much as a technical one.\r\n\r\nThere is considerably more to be said about the many contours of the \u201csocial project\u201d of decarbonization, but much of it will have to wait for future work. This Article does not attempt to explore the range of potential considerations or solutions in their entirety, nor does it make any judgment about the most viable or desirable version of this social project. For the present argument, it is enough to understand that decar\u00adbonization is, inexorably, more than just a technical challenge. Discus\u00adsions around its trajectory implicate choices and values that extend far beyond what technologies are available at what costs.[footnote]Many scholars outside the legal field have forcefully made similar points.

The sections that follow contend that state politics present a better avenue for this determination than quasi-private, regional electricity markets.\r\n<h3>B. State Policies as Reflections of the Social Project of Decarbonization<\/h3>\r\nAlthough no state has embraced a vision of decarbonization near either extreme described above, state responses to climate change simi\u00adlarly evince an understanding of the significant political and value choices bound up in decarbonization policy.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, state variations in RPSs, which demonstrate pref\u00aderences for certain resources that are either locally abundant (for example, Maryland\u2019s chicken manure) or particularly desirable, but less economi\u00adcally competitive (for example, rooftop solar carve-outs).[footnote]See supra section I.B.[\/footnote] In both of these instances, states have chosen to promote certain aims beyond \u201cmere decarbonization\u201d\u2014that is, the lowest-cost decarbonization achievable.[footnote]Indeed, even the choice of a renewables requirement\u2014as opposed to a broader \u201cclean energy\u201d standard\u2014illustrates a preference in this regard. Lincoln Davies catalogues the many \u201cancillary benefits\u201d an RPS can bring. Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1357\u201359.[\/footnote] By including chicken manure in its RPS, Maryland provided a potential additional stream of revenue to the state\u2019s many poultry farmers, while diverting nitrogen-rich poultry manure from running off into the Chesapeake Bay\u2014a body of water that has faced significant problems of nitrogen overloading.[footnote]See Dep\u2019t of Legislative Servs. of Md.

A policy preference for distributed generation ensures that renewable energy built in a state will not all occur in large-scale, utility- or developer-led projects that consume open space.

Is It All Just Rent Seeking?<\/h3>\r\nIt is not difficult to conjure up a public-choice-minded skeptic\u2019s swift reaction to my argument: social project? These state policies are all just examples of successful rent seeking, in which certain powerful industries are benefitting to the detriment of the people of the state![footnote]\u201cPublic choice models\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. treat the legislative process as a microeconomic system in which \u2018actual political choices are determined by the efforts of individuals and groups to further their own interests; these efforts have been labeled \u2018rent-seeking.\u2019\u201d Daniel A.

To respond to these concerns, this section makes two brief points. First, this Article\u2019s argument does not turn on a rejec\u00adtion of public choice theory or on proof that harmful rent seeking is absent from state climate policy. Public debate and public churn about the aims and methods of decarbonization are valuable <em>even if <\/em>they some\u00adtimes result in certain industries getting a boost. Unjustified rent seeking can be (and is being[footnote]See infra section III.C (discussing lawsuits against state policies).[\/footnote]) contested through the courts and in the theater of public debate. In contrast, utilizing RTO governance structures and energy markets as the locus for debating, hashing out, and implementing decarbonization policy shunts these debates to much more private, inaccessible quarters\u2014<em>without <\/em>eliminating the distinct possibility of rent seeking also occurring in those forums.[footnote]On RTO governance processes, see infra section III.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSecond, it is not clear that state decarbonization policy preferences can easily be shrugged aside as examples of problematic rent seeking. To be sure, some of these state policies appear to favor certain industries. But in the case of the most dominant state policy, RPS, it is more fledg\u00adling solar and wind developers who stand to benefit most\u2014at the expense of established fossil fuel companies. That\u2019s hardly a predictable outcome under a public choice explanation of the companies most likely to hold sway with government. The same holds true for numerous other state policies that work against incumbent utility interests.[footnote]See Elias L. Quinn &amp; Adam L. Reed, Envisioning the Smart Grid: Network Architecture, Information Control, and the Public Policy Balancing Act, 81 U. Colo. L.

Even there, though, the supporters of the policy defy simplistic explanation\u2014the ZEC program divided the environmental community, with many groups coming out in support of it.[footnote]Clean Energy Standard Order, supra note 99, at 53 (noting \u201ccomments among environmental groups are divided\u201d).[\/footnote] This divi\u00adsion suggests that many saw ZECs as productively serving decarbonization goals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even accepting that some rent seeking may be at work in these policies, it might not be <em>bad <\/em>rent seeking.[footnote]Many scholars have remarked on the indeterminacy of the concept of \u201crent seek\u00ading\u201d\u2014one person\u2019s \u201crent\u201d is another person\u2019s social-welfare gain.

Professor Eric Biber has made the case that when it comes to climate change, state policies that build interest-group support may create \u201cpolit\u00adical momentum\u201d that prevents backsliding and allows for a gradual ratch\u00adeting up of the ambition of climate policies.[footnote]Eric Biber, Cultivating a Green Political Landscape: Lessons for Climate Change Policy from the Defeat of California\u2019s Proposition 23, 66 Vand.

This suggestion works if indeed the state views efficiency as a good measure of social welfare. But if a state determines that other aims trump efficiency, then it might be perfectly justified in choosing policies that deviate substantially from a carbon tax.[\/footnote] This Article\u2019s argument is broader: Any apparent rent seeking in these policies may be justified as a way to fulfill values related to decarbonization that go beyond efficiency.[footnote]Cf. Mark Sagoff, Economic Theory and Environmental Law, 79 Mich. L. Rev. 1393, 1396\u201397 (1981) (explaining how many of our laws appropriately reflect preferences for ends other than efficiency); Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets, supra note 37, at 1024 (suggesting that Americans are interested in fairness and protection from market failure in addition to efficiency maximization).[\/footnote] When states establish climate change policies, they are\u2014at least in part\u2014channeling value judgments about how decarbonization should proceed.[footnote]The democratic link might appear weaker when agencies\u2014rather than legisla\u00adtures\u2014make decisions about the shape of decarbonization policy. There is, however, a literature suggesting that agencies might be better positioned in some ways to adopt dem\u00adocratically determined preferences. See Jerry L. Mashaw, Greed, Chaos, and Governance: Using Public Choice to Improve Public Law 37 (1999); Mark Seidenfeld, A Civic Republican Justification for the Administrative State, 105 Harv. L.

In response to surveys and deliberative polls, individuals have expressed several values beyond pure economic efficiency they consider important in energy systems change, including \u201cnot wasting;\u201d environmental protection; stability, reli\u00adability, and affordability; autonomy and freedom; and social justice and fairness.[footnote]Butler et al., Public Values, supra note 147, at 667.[\/footnote] These diverse values lead people to have strong preferences for certain technologies over others;[footnote]Professor Dirk Scheer and his coauthors find a strong preference for renewable energy over fossil fuel generation combined with \u201ccarbon capture and storage.\u201d Dirk Scheer et al., Public Evaluation of Electricity Technologies and Future Low-Carbon Portfolios in Germany and the USA, 3 Energy, Sustainability &amp; Soc\u2019y, no. 8, 2013, at 1; see also Butler et al., Public Values, supra note 147, at 670 (describing \u201cpublic visions\u201d as \u201ccon\u00adverg[ing] with policy on some of the key areas, specifically reductions in fossil fuels, increases in RETS\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. , and the need for reductions in demand\u201d); Demski et al., supra note 147, at 59\u201360, 66 (finding a strong public preference, through deliberative work\u00adshops, among U.K. residents for \u201cmicro-generation technologies\u201d); Nick Pidgeon &amp; Christina C.

State policies on decarbonization, then, can be seen as attempts to capture the \u201cmessy, pluralistic, and pragmatic\u201d goals associated with the social project of decarbonization and to give voice to community judgments regarding the desired shape of our future decarbonized soci\u00adety.[footnote]See Kysar, supra note 38, at 3, 15\u201316 (making the argument that these charac\u00adteristics have always described the diverse goals of environmental policymaking).[\/footnote] Responding to and incorporating these preferences helps a state maintain broad citizen support for its decarbonization initiatives. With\u00adout this support, passing the laws necessary to reach \u201cdeep decarboniza\u00adtion\u201d levels of carbon mitigation will be all the more difficult.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is no guarantee that state policies are accurately chan\u00adneling residents\u2019 preferences in these regards.[footnote]Cf.

My argument here regarding the \u201csocial nature\u201d of the project of decarbonization leads me to conclude that supplementary policies are desirable to the extent that a polity wants to control the shape of decarbonization.[\/footnote] Putting a price on carbon is theoretically appealing because of its potential breadth, simplicity, and efficiency.[footnote]See Liscow &amp; Karpilow, supra note 168, at 457\u201363 (collecting sources in favor of carbon pricing); see also Peter Howard &amp; Derek Sylvan, Inst. for Policy Integrity, Expert Consensus on the Economics of Climate Change 2 (2015), <a href=\"http:\/\/policyintegrity.org\/files\/publications\/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf\">http:\/\/policyintegrity.org\/\r\nfiles\/publications\/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/DE98-N2RW] (report\u00ading survey results showing that 75% of expert economists favor a market-based mechanism for carbon); Jerry Taylor, Niskanen Ctr., The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax 3\u201310 (2015), http:\/\/niskanencenter.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/K8LE-Z9Q8] (arguing that the alternative to a carbon tax \u201cis a plethora of command-and-control regulatory interventions,\u201d which already \u201cimpose a sort of carbon tax\u201d).[\/footnote] Most states with robust decarbonization policies also support some sort of national carbon-pricing scheme, particularly one that would allow them to pursue additional side policies to address their citizens\u2019 decarbonization prefer\u00adences.[footnote]Most states do not, however, favor allowing federal policy to preempt supplemen\u00adtary state policies.

Although covering less of the country and less of the economy than a federal carbon price, including decarbonization aims in electricity markets still holds some advantages over state-by-state efforts. The many parties in favor of using markets to achieve decarbonization goals argue that market incorporation represents the most feasible way, in the cur\u00adrent political climate, to efficiently decarbonize.[footnote]See infra notes 197\u2013199.[\/footnote] At the same time, they suggest, incorporating state climate goals into markets would help con\u00adtrol the purported damage that variegated state climate policies do to regional electricity markets.[footnote]See supra section I.C.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis Part first describes leading proposals for how to achieve state climate goals through RTO markets and the governance processes these proposals would have to go through. It then advances three reasons why the compromise measure of achieving decarbonization through electric\u00adity markets is a risky substitute for robust, democratically determined action on climate change. In brief, these reasons are that (1) procedur\u00adally, given RTO governance structures, using these market constructs to achieve climate goals would remove decisions over decarbonization fur\u00adther from the public view and democratic oversight; (2) substantively, incorporating climate goals into regional electricity markets would homogenize and water down state preferences; and (3) recent Supreme Court precedent creates a risk that once states cede control over decarboni\u00adzation to an RTO, they may give away some ability to adopt supplementary policies to strengthen or shape the trajectory of their decarbon\u00adization efforts.\r\n<h3>A. Proposed Market Reforms to Achieve State Policies<\/h3>\r\nStakeholders have proposed two predominant reforms to incorpo\u00adrate state climate aims into regional electricity markets. The first is for electricity markets to create their own carbon-pricing systems, analogous to a carbon tax. Thus, for example, certain stakeholders in New England\u2019s RTO have proposed the following scheme:\r\n<blockquote>Under a carbon pricing system, each electricity producer would pay an emissions fee in direct proportion to the amount of car\u00adbon (in tons) its generation facilities emit. The carbon emis\u00adsions price (that is, the fee per ton emitted) could be fixed, be a set price schedule that increases over time, or be dynamically adjusted based on aggregate performance over time to satisfy specific carbon reduction objectives.[footnote]ISO New England, NEPOOL 2016 IMAPP Proposals: Observations, Issues, and Next Steps 2 (2017) [hereinafter ISO-NE Proposal], http:\/\/www.iso-ne.com\/static-assets\/\r\ndocuments\/2017\/03\/iso-ne_jan_2017_imapp_memo_vtransmit2.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\n2354-QND3]. The ways in which this scheme would interact with the current carbon-pricing regime in the New England region are discussed in section IV.B.[\/footnote]<\/blockquote>\r\nPJM\u2014the mid-Atlantic RTO\u2014has proposed a similar scheme, sug\u00adgesting a carbon-pricing system might also be pursued by a subset of the region interested in a carbon price, should the entire region prove unable to reach agreement.[footnote]PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives Through PJM\u2019s Energy Markets: A Review of Carbon-Pricing Frameworks 1 (2017) [hereinafter PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives], http:\/\/pjm.com\/~\/media\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/20170502-\r\nadvancing-zero-emission-objectives-through-pjms-energy-markets.ashx [http:\/\/perma.cc\/\r\nJ9B9-4N5X].[\/footnote] And New York\u2019s RTO has also come out in favor of a car\u00adbon-pricing scheme in that single-state market.[footnote]See Bradley C.

Monast et al., On Morals, Markets, and Climate Change: Exploring Pope Francis\u2019 Challenge, 80 Law &amp; Contemp.

Relatedly, it avoids the need to constantly guard against potential market distortions caused by state public policies, thus maintaining predictable, well-functioning competitive markets.[footnote]See, e.g., EPSA, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 197, at 2 (arguing that FERC should incorporate decarbonization policies into markets as the strategy most \u201ccon\u00adsistent with investing private at-risk capital based on market price signals\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nDespite widespread support, these proposals are not without challenges. One of these is legal\u2014it is not clear that federally overseen electricity markets have the mandate to include environmental considera\u00ad\u00adtions within their dispatch models. As noted in the introduction, many excellent legal minds are engaged in this analysis.[footnote]See supra note 35.[\/footnote] A second challenge is less strictly legal in nature, although it implicates jurisdictional fric\u00adtions. It is relatively clear what states might gain from integrating climate policies into regional electricity markets. But no action is without tradeoffs. What, then, do they stand to lose? The remainder of this Part tackles this question.\r\n<h3>B.

When it submits its final deci\u00adsions to FERC, however, an RTO board frequently explains major devi\u00adations from members\u2019 recommendations.[footnote]See, e.g., E4The Future, Inc., supra note 211, at 4 (noting that when the New England RTO provides a proposal to FERC without unanimous stakeholder support, it must \u201cexplain in its filing why its proposal is superior\u201d).[\/footnote] In practice, then, it is substantially easier for a board to establish that a proposed change is \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d if a substantial proportion of its members\u2014and its members\u2019 states\u2014so agree.[footnote]See supra note 210 and accompanying text (discussing the standard by which FERC evaluates an RTO\u2019s proposed changes).[\/footnote] Members, states, or other stakeholders that continue to disagree with an RTO proposal can protest the changes dur\u00ading FERC\u2019s vetting process or ultimately through a lawsuit.[footnote]See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0825l(b) (2012).[\/footnote] These pro\u00adtests can also be backed up by the more drastic measure of deciding to leave the RTO (in the case of member utilities)[footnote]See Dworkin &amp; Goldwasser, supra note 51, at 570 (arguing that members\u2019 ability to \u201cvote with [their] feet\u201d threatens RTO independence, as RTOs \u201cdesire to retain partici\u00adpants and geographic spread\u201d).[\/footnote] or requiring their utili\u00adties to leave the RTO (in the case of states).\r\n\r\nAny decision by an RTO to incorporate decarbonization objectives into market operations would occur through the process outlined above: An RTO board would determine\u2014by a requisite margin of votes\u2014that such changes would help to ensure \u201cjust and reasonable rates\u201d and would file a petition with FERC to have such changes approved.

Resulting Challenges for RTO Control of Decarbonization<\/h3>\r\nSeveral characteristics of RTOs make them imperfect sites for deci\u00adsions on the shape of decarbonization policies. This section details three particular flaws that should give states pause in ceding control over decarbonization policy to their RTOs: (1) RTO governance presents a diminished space for deliberative, democratic decisionmaking, as com\u00adpared to state politics; (2) RTO-governance structures create a tendency for policies to become homogenized and watered down when adopted at the regional level; and (3) the jurisdictional frictions created by <em>Hughes<\/em> pose a risk that states may diminish their own tools for controlling decar\u00adbonization if they cede the same functions to their RTOs.\r\n\r\n1. <em>A Loss of Public Procedure<\/em>. \u2014 The first challenge of RTO control over decarbonization policies has to do with RTOs\u2019 governance structure, and in particular, the relative sway of various stakeholders and members within RTO governance. Many suspect that stakeholders with assets man\u00adaged by the RTO\u2014that is, transmission owners\u2014have outsized influence, given that they can wield the threat of leaving the RTO should they be dissatisfied with a change in the governing rules.[footnote]See, e.g., American Municipal Power, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 112, at 2 (suggesting the \u201crules churn\u201d at PJM provides \u201ca cloak for \u2018gaming\u2019 behavior\u201d); see also, e.g., Dworkin &amp; Goldwasser, supra note 51, at 561\u201362 (noting stakeholder worries that RTOs are not as independent as they should be); Kavulla, supra note 56 (suggesting that \u201cusually\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. moneyed \u2018stakeholders\u2019 get their way\u201d); Kenneth Rose, Trouble in Market Paradise: Development of the Regional Transmission Operator, 50 J. Econ. Issues 535, 536 (2016) (noting RTOs\u2019 stakeholders include \u201cmarket participants\u201d with \u201cstrong economic interest[s] in RTO rules and procedures\u201d).[\/footnote] Similarly, although \u201cmembership\u201d is not limited to these asset holders, weighted voting by membership sector can stack the deck against public interest organiza\u00adtions or those without a strong foothold in the industry.[footnote]See Blumsack et al., supra note 215, at 3083 (\u201c[T]here may be limits to the degree to which organizations like RTOs can create mechanisms for heterogeneous stake\u00adholders with opposing interests to develop passable market rules and protocols.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if the stakeholder-committee processes were viewed as fair, participation in them would still be challenging. In a recent study that interviewed numerous participants in RTO governance, the tenor of many responses was along the following lines: To participate successfully, \u201cyou have to be a combination of an economist and a math wizard.\u201d[footnote]Stafford &amp; Wilson, supra note 212, at 230; see also id. (quoting a respondent des\u00adcribing these processes as \u201ca world of acronyms\u201d in which it is easy to get lost).[\/footnote] Others observed that the sheer quantity of stakeholder meetings at RTOs makes it impossible for smaller, less resourced organizations to participate.[footnote]Id. at 231 (quoting a respondent to highlight the multitude of RTO stakeholder meetings which often occur at overlapping times).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese challenges point to the first key risk of shunting decarboniza\u00adtion policy into RTOs: They offer considerably less transparent, only quasi-public frameworks in which to make these critically important deci\u00adsions. Although RTO-governance processes <em>nominally <\/em>give boards inde\u00adpendent decisionmaking power (a structure that itself already lessens public accountability), their membership rules and the weight that FERC gives to stakeholder opinions\u2014both as a matter of law and practice\u2014dampen this independence.[footnote]See Dworkin &amp; Goldwasser, supra note 51, at 562, 570\u201371 (noting RTOs\u2019 need to \u201cmaintain relationships with\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. stakeholders\u201d).[\/footnote] Thus, if RTOs take over decarbonization policymaking, it will not be elected public officials or their appointed bureaucrats, but private companies, who will hold much of the power to determine the shape of these efforts.\r\n\r\nHaving expressed these concerns about stakeholder governance, it is important to acknowledge some limits on the extent to which private companies would shape RTO-led decarbonization efforts, particularly on the front end. No RTO is likely to proceed with decarbonization efforts without support from participating states, at least in the current legal and political climate.[footnote]In contrast, if significant national climate change policy reemerged, one could imagine an RTO basing its authority to integrate decarbonization goals on this legal requirement, rather than on state legal requirements.[\/footnote] States hold this sway because of another feature of RTOs: their explicit disengagement from creating new \u201cpolicy.\u201d[footnote]Stafford &amp; Wilson, supra note 212, at 229 (suggesting state-level policy dictates RTO policy).[\/footnote] RTO representatives maintain: \u201cWe are a taker of policy not a maker of policy. .\u00a0.\u00a0. We don\u2019t create policy. We attempt to interpret policy as handed to us.\u201d[footnote]Id.[\/footnote] Because RTOs eschew any role in determining what the \u201cpublic interest\u201d is, states retain what Professor Christina Simeone has described as \u201can incredible amount of power and influence\u201d in shaping the interac\u00adtion of public policies and markets.[footnote]Simeone, supra note 205, at 27.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nRTOs disclaim this policymaking function for both political and legal reasons. Politically, it would be substantially harder to convince states to let their utilities join or remain in RTOs if membership meant ceding state policymaking authority to this quasi-private entity. As a legal matter, imagine if an RTO were to include any sort of decarbonization requirement\u2014such as a carbon price\u2014that caused a state\u2019s utilities to pay extra for electricity. For states in which state decarbonization policy supported this change, a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d finding would be under\u00adstandable\u2014as noted above, pricing carbon in the market would likely help the state accomplish its aims at the lowest price possible. In contrast, for any state that did not have a policy in place that supported this extra payment, a carbon price might well be \u201cunjust and unreasonable\u201d because it would force the residents of the state to pay more for reasons unsupported by any state or federal policy.[footnote]See Robert R. Scott, Comm\u2019r, N.H. Pub. Util.

RTOs would be unlikely to request such changes in their tariffs unless both stakeholder committees\u2014via super-majority vote\u2014and all states in a region endorsed the request. FERC, similarly, would be unlikely to approve the request if any state felt it unfairly required its customers to pay for more decarbonization than state law mandated. Not only would all of these negotiations occur deeper in the shadows than does state climate change policymaking, but this de facto near-consensus procedural requirement would also likely have troubling substantive impacts, discussed in the following section.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Homogenization and the Watering Down of Preferences<\/em>. \u2014 The second challenge with using RTOs to achieve state decarbonization aims is that their structure and legal mandate leaves them with a diminished set of policy tools as compared to states. Accordingly, the use of these markets to achieve state goals would likely entail both homogenization and water\u00ading down of state preferences.\r\n\r\nThe more drastic homogenizing force would come from imposition of a carbon price, which would require substantial regional agreement across a range of topics. The entire theory behind a carbon-pricing scheme is that it eliminates aims beyond the cheapest decarbonization achievable.[footnote]Peskoe, supra note 35, at 34 (suggesting the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d is not cur\u00adrently reflected in FERC rates).[\/footnote] Away would go state preferences for particular types of clean energy, particular locations or scales, or broad-based inclusion or redistribution as a part of decarbonization policy (except to the extent that states continued to pursue these goals through separate, state-specific side policies).[footnote]See Spence, Na\u00efve Energy Markets, supra note 37, at 988\u201392, 1001 (describing how energy markets reduce all decisionmaking to economic optimality, ignoring questions of redistribution or values other than efficiency). Whether states could pursue their desired suite of side policies would depend on how circuit courts interpret and apply <em>Hughes\u2013<\/em>\u2014a topic taken up infra section IV.B.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nMoreover, states would also have to homogenize their timing and targets for decarbonization. In order for a carbon price to work, there would likely have to be a single price throughout a region.[footnote]See PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives, supra note 190, at 1 (\u201cTo avoid significant complexity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. a single carbon price is required across the carbon price sub-region.\u201d). Brattle Group suggests a multistate region could possibly administer multiple carbon prices, although it admits that such an idea is \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cneeds to be developed further.\u201d See Brattle Group, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 198, at 4.[\/footnote] Setting this price would be challenging, given the divergent state decarbonization targets that exist in multistate regions.[footnote]See Conservation Law Found., FERC Technical Conference, supra note 199, at 1\u20132 (discussing the complexity of \u201cintegrating state policy preferences into RTO Markets\u201d); see also Brian Forshaw, Conn. Mun. Elec. Energy Coop., Written Comments for FERC Technical Conference: State Policies and Wholesale Markets Operated by ISO-New England, Inc., New York Independent System Operator, Inc. and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., at 4 (May 1, 2017) [hereinafter CMEEC, FERC Technical Conference], http:\/\/\r\nwww.ferc.gov\/CalendarFiles\/20170426150137-Forshaw,%20Energy%20Market%20Advisors.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/RP35-N3Y9].[\/footnote] To reach region-wide agreement on a price, states with higher targets would either have to accept a price that would not fully satisfy their decarbonization goals, or find a way to refund revenues from the regional carbon-pricing scheme to those neighbor-states that otherwise feel that they would be \u201coverpaying\u201d (a politically contentious work-around, to be sure).[footnote]See PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives, supra note 190, at 1\u20132 (explain\u00ading the need for states to agree on participation and on a price).[\/footnote] This dynamic would create a pull toward a \u201clowest-common-denominator\u201d level of carbon pricing\u2014which would be bad both for states keen on rapid decarboniza\u00adtion and for free-riding states that want to see their neighbors carry more of the burden of achieving decarbonization.[footnote]Dworkin &amp; Goldwasser, supra note 51, at 564 (explaining that the structure of RTO governance means that \u201c[t]he need for consensus may result in the least common denominator option winning out\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nA less drastic homogenization of state climate policies might occur in the case of a Forward Clean Energy Market. In this model, states could control their overall level of desired renewable procurement and pass this information on to the market operator.[footnote]In this way, the Clean Energy Market is not intended \u201cto eliminate or replace state renewable portfolio standards, but\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. is a complimentary system for market procure\u00adment of the RECs needed to meet the RPS.\u201d Renew Northeast &amp; Nextera Energy, Presentation at NEPOOL IMAPP Meeting: A New IMAPP Proposal 13 (Jan. 25, 2017) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>).[\/footnote] But such a scheme would still require, at a minimum, agreement on qualifying resources. To be sure, the scheme could be designed to allow states to make requests for certain types, as well as amounts, of renewable power.[footnote]See id. at 6.[\/footnote] The more the market was segmented by resource type, however, the less benefit it would provide in the form of an interstate, least-cost auction.[footnote]See id.[\/footnote] Accord\u00adingly, a Forward Clean Energy Market would also create pressure to homogenize resource preferences in order to reap the benefits of creat\u00ading a regional auction.[footnote]Professor Felix Mormann confirms this argument by making a similar point with respect to the idea of pursuing a federal RPS, arguing that \u201c[g]eographic gains from a federal policy approach would likely come at the expense of a federal RPS\u2019s aspirational aggressiveness,\u201d because a \u201cfederally palatable RPS regime\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. would likely aim lower aspi\u00adrationally and, ultimately, have a shallower impact.\u201d Mormann, supra note 36, at 1643.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe homogenizing forces described here present two distinct lines of concern. The first springs from theories of democratic experimentalism.[footnote]See Michael C. Dorf &amp; Charles F. Sabel, A Constitution of Democratic Experimentalism, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 267, 288 (1998) (arguing for greater use of \u201cdemo\u00adcratic experimentalism,\u201d in which localities experiment in government service provision and central regulators facilitate learning from one another\u2019s experimentation).[\/footnote] Because decarbonization is in the early stages of what looks to be a long, expensive, transformative slog, perhaps it is best at this stage to allow multiple models to flourish, instead of subsuming state policies into regional markets. Former FERC Chair Norman Bay adopted this position in a concurrence authored right before his resignation, in which he celebrated state decarbonization policies for their experimental character.[footnote]See N.Y. State Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. N.Y. Indep. Sys. Operator, Inc., 158 FERC \u00b6 61,137 (Feb. 3, 2017), 2017 WL 496267, at *12 (Bay, Comm\u2019r, concurring) (\u201cIn our consti\u00adtutional order, states are rightly celebrated for being laboratories for experimentation. Among other things, those laboratories may incentivize the development of needed energy infrastructure, the deployment of innovative technologies, or the establishment of Renewable Portfolio Standards.\u201d (footnote omitted)).[\/footnote] And Professors Ann Carlson and William Boyd have made a thoughtful case regarding the national decarbonization benefits that such state experiments can produce.[footnote]See Boyd &amp; Carlson, supra note 6, at 815 (explaining how state diversity in electricity governance has led to \u201cinteresting examples of policy innovation\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThis classic \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d line of argument is compel\u00adling, but it captures only part of the challenge that states face as they con\u00adsider regionalizing their decarbonization efforts through RTOs. In this context, the choice is not simply between the state, regional, or federal <em>scale <\/em>as the locus of policymaking. Instead, choosing between the state and regional scale also implicates a fundamental choice between electric\u00adity <em>markets<\/em> or <em>regulation <\/em>as the fundamental driver of decarbonization. States that turn RPSs or carbon pricing over to RTOs must be willing to allow RTO governance to dictate the terms of these policies going for\u00adward. To relinquish control to a regional electricity market is thus to authorize a diminishment in the suite of tools and scope of control avail\u00adable to publicly manage decarbonization.\r\n\r\n3. <em>The Risk of Aggrandizing Market Control<\/em>. \u2014 There is an obvious objection to the argument made in the previous subsection: Why assume that if states were to give regional markets some control over achieving climate change goals, they could not continue to shape decarbonization\u2019s trajectory through complementary side policies if necessary? This argu\u00adment relates to an argument economists often make about the risks of mixing policy aims: Why not let markets take care of decarbonization as cheaply as possible and then let states craft <em>separate <\/em>policies to accomplish their additional aims? Wouldn\u2019t this be better than letting states design these inefficient, multifaceted policies that attempt to mash together the goals of decarbonization with social justice and economic growth?[footnote]See Eric A. Posner &amp; David Weisbach, Climate Change Justice 169\u201388 (2010) (discussing the \u201cethical obligations of wealthy nations\u201d in climate change policies); cf. Louis Kaplow &amp; Steven Shavell, Should Legal Rules Favor the Poor? Clarifying the Role of Legal Rules and the Income Tax in Redistributing Income, 29 J. Legal Stud. 821, 822\u201326 (2000) (advocating for an income-tax system, rather than legal rules, as a means of help\u00ading the poor).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe response to this argument again revolves around the patholo\u00adgies of electricity markets, and in particular, the way these markets oper\u00adate under shared state and federal jurisdiction.[footnote]I do not mean to argue that jurisdictional friction presents the only reason that states might prefer to create policies jointly aimed at decarbonization and other social goals. Others have written general rebuttals to the argument that redistributional aims should be separated from other policy goals. See, e.g., Daniel A. Farber, Climate Justice, 110 Mich. L. Rev. 985, 989 (2012) (reviewing Posner &amp; Weisbach, supra note 250) (\u201cTo say that we should not engage in redistribution unless we can implement the ideal form of redistribution is really to say that we should not engage in redistribution at all.\u201d); Lee Anne Fennell &amp; Richard H. McAdams, Fairness in Law and Economics: Introduction 5 (Univ. of Chi. Pub. Law &amp; Legal Theory, Working Paper No. 489, 2014) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (arguing the high political costs of tax redistribution may make it cheaper to redistribute outside the tax scheme). The jurisdictional churn in electricity law presents particular reason to eschew using these markets to decarbonize.[\/footnote] In brief, the challenge is this: Once a state cedes policy objectives to its regional electricity mar\u00adket, the state may suffer limits on its ability to craft supplementary poli\u00adcies or to reclaim the objectives if it does not like the results the market produces.\r\n\r\nThis argument no doubt appears strange at first blush. Why should a state lose its ability to reclaim control over public-policy objectives, if it only voluntarily gives the market control over these objectives in the first place? The complicating factor is a recent line of Supreme Court juris\u00adprudence interpreting the state\u2013federal boundary in electricity law, which updates the longstanding principle that \u201c[s]tates may not regulate in areas where FERC has properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale rates.\u201d[footnote]Miss. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 374 (1988).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOf particular relevance is the Supreme Court\u2019s 2016 decision in <em>Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC<\/em>, which considered a subsidy scheme devised by Maryland to incentivize power plants to build in the state.[footnote]136 S. Ct. 1288, 1294\u201395 (2016).[\/footnote] Although Maryland\u2019s RTO, PJM, ran a capacity market to ensure future resource adequacy throughout the region,[footnote]See Conn. Dep\u2019t of Pub.

Cir. 2009) (describing PJM\u2019s capacity market).[\/footnote] Maryland was frus\u00adtrated that the market was not incentivizing any generation to locate in congested areas of the state, where electricity prices were higher than average.[footnote]See <em>Hughes<\/em>, 136 S.

Learjet, Inc.<\/em>[footnote]135 S. Ct. 1591 (2015).[\/footnote] and <em>FERC v. Electric Power Supply Ass\u2019n<\/em>.[footnote]136 S. Ct. 760 (2016).[\/footnote] The Court\u2019s 2016 decision in <em>Electric Power Supply Ass\u2019n<\/em> affirmed FERC\u2019s jurisdiction over any practice \u201cdirectly affecting\u201d wholesale rates, striking down states\u2019 arguments that FERC had overreached its jurisdic\u00adtion.[footnote]Id. at 760.[\/footnote] The year before, in <em>OneOK<\/em>, the Court clarified that field preemp\u00adtion of state energy law should turn on an analysis of the <em>purpose <\/em>of the state regulation, such that courts should examine \u201cthe target at which the state law aims in determining whether that law is pre-empted.\u201d[footnote]<em>OneOK<\/em>, 135 S. Ct. at 1599 (emphasis omitted). Interestingly, though, the Court did not rely on <em>OneOK<\/em>\u2019s test in deciding <em>Hughes<\/em> the following year.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFor present purposes, the fallout of <em>Hughes<\/em> and related precedents is that there might be substantial consequences to ceding new powers to regional electricity markets. <em>Hughes <\/em>made clear that because Maryland had granted PJM the right to control resource adequacy in the region by running a capacity market, the state lost some of its ability to concur\u00adrently strive to achieve the same goals. In contrast, right now RTOs claim no control over decarbonization. Quite the contrary: They specifically decry any obligation in this regard. But what if states were to grant their electricity-market operator control over decarbonization? Then, under the logic of <em>Hughes <\/em>and <em>OneOK<\/em>, states might be preempted from tying any state policies too closely to whatever market construct for decarbon\u00adization the RTO devised. In particular, states would have to be careful not to impermissibly \u201ctether\u201d their policies or prices for clean energy to the results of regional clean-energy or carbon markets.[footnote]See Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1299 (2016) (\u201cNothing in this opinion should be read to foreclose Maryland and other States from encouraging production of new or clean generation through measures \u2018untethered to a generator\u2019s wholesale market participation.\u2019\u201d (quoting Brief for Respondents at 40, <em>Hughes<\/em>, 136 S. Ct. 1288 (Nos. 14-614, 14-623), 2016 WL 183803)).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nTo be sure, even if a state decided to allow decarbonization to pro\u00adceed through its RTO, many traditional state methods of encouraging decarbonization would likely not be threatened\u2014including tax breaks, financial incentives, and straightforward subsidies. Although part of the picture, these methods have not emerged as the predominant tools that states use to regulate climate. Instead, the most important state policies are those that proceed through rate regulation, including RPSs, ZECs, regional carbon prices, procurement mandates, and ratepayer support of certain technologies.[footnote]See Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 298\u2013306.[\/footnote] There is a reason that these policies predominate: They are funded not through general taxation but through the rate base. They are, in other words, a form of covert \u201ctaxation by regula\u00adtion,\u201d[footnote]Richard A. Posner, Taxation by Regulation, 2 Bell J. Econ. &amp; Mgmt. Sci. 22, 23 (1971) (describing the phenomenon of \u201cinternal subsidies,\u201d where policy aims are accom\u00adplished through the use of rate regulation); see also Rossi, Carbon Taxation, supra note 8, at 278\u201380 (explaining how these climate change-related tools are a new version of Posner\u2019s classic internal subsidization).[\/footnote] which serves as a more politically feasible way to meet decarbon\u00adization aims than direct taxation.[footnote]Whether rate regulation presents a <em>superior <\/em>mechanism for accomplishing decar\u00adbonization as compared to more general taxation is a question beyond the scope of this Article. Rossi provides a partial defense of such policies in <em>Carbon Taxation by Regulation<\/em>, supra note 8. Rossi argues that carbon taxation by regulation can and does function as an effective\u2014albeit fragmented\u2014substitute for carbon regulation but suggests that several reforms would help it do so more effectively. See id. at 323\u201341.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nUnder the <em>Hughes <\/em>framework, these popular forms of \u201ccarbon taxa\u00adtion by regulation\u201d would be particularly threatened by RTO jurisdiction over decarbonization. Regional carbon-pricing and state procurement schemes would be at risk if they were designed in ways that pegged their pricing to market outcomes.[footnote]See <em>Hughes<\/em>, 136 S. Ct. at 1299.[\/footnote] Even Renewable Portfolio Standards\u2014the central mechanism of state clean-energy policy to date\u2014might prove vulnerable under an expansive interpretation of <em>Hughes<\/em>, should a state wish to pursue an RPS design that differs from a regional clean-energy procurement market.[footnote]Part IV describes why an expansive reading of <em>Hughes<\/em>, of the sort that would inval\u00adidate RPSs, is unlikely. Nevertheless, the concern is a live one, even absent RTO subsumma\u00adtion of decarbonization goals. Several parties in the ZEC litigation have worried that if ZECs are illegal, so too are RPSs. See Joel Eisen, The New (Clear?) Electricity Federalism: Federal Preemption of States\u2019 \u201cZero Emissions Credit\u201d Programs, 45 Ecology L.Q. (forthcoming 2018) (manuscript at 18) [hereinafter Eisen, Electricity Federalism] (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>) (collecting commentators raising this concern). Many participants in the ZEC litigation, however, assert that ZECs are different in kind from RPSs and other state policies. See Proposed Brief of Amicus Curiae American Wind Energy Ass\u2019n in Support of Neither Party at 2, Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Star, No. 1:17-cv-01163 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 13, 2017). In his forthcoming article, Professor Joel Eisen argues for a reading of <em>Hughes <\/em>and related cases that would invalidate ZECs but allow state RPS policies to stand. See Eisen, Electricity Federalism, supra (manuscript at 19) (\u201cZECs aim directly at remedy\u00ading the revenue shortfall on the wholesale markets. RECs do not, because they are designed with reference to environmental attributes, not wholesale market prices.\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nA hypothetical example helps illustrate these concerns. Consider the case in which a state wishes to promote a particular type of renewable resource in the state that its RPS is inadequately incentivizing\u2014say, off\u00adshore wind. Right now, in order to promote more offshore wind, a state would be free to offer that generator a long-term premium <em>on top of <\/em>REC prices that fluctuates based on how much the generator is able to earn from the REC market.[footnote]See WSPP Inc., 139 FERC \u00b6 61,061 (Apr. 20, 2012), 2012 WL 1395532, at *4 (find\u00ading that the separate sale of RECs does not fall within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction).[\/footnote] The state might find this particular method for promoting certain renewables quite attractive, as it would create long-term investor certainty without complicating the state\u2019s RPS or causing residents to overpay.[footnote]See supra note 95.[\/footnote] But if renewables procurement were to become RTO administered and FERC jurisdictional (through proposals such as a regional clean-energy market), it is unclear whether such a scheme would survive. It might, under the logic of <em>Hughes <\/em>and <em>OneOK<\/em>, be too closely tethered in purpose or effect to the newly FERC-jurisdic\u00adtional clean-energy market.\r\n\r\nLess hypothetically, consider New York\u2019s current study of adopting a single-state RTO carbon adder. There, regulators have proposed that a market carbon price and the state REC program can and should operate simultaneously.[footnote]Newell et al., supra note 194, at iv (\u201cWe assume the carbon charge is designed to com\u00adplement (rather than replace)\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. existing policies that contribute to decarbonization.\u201d).[\/footnote] To facilitate this dual scheme, an August 2017 study by the Brattle Group proposed that \u201c[f]uture REC contracts could be struc\u00adtured so that the price adjusts automatically with changes in carbon prices, mitigating regulatory uncertainty associated with a carbon charge.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 46.[\/footnote] Again, under the logic of <em>Hughes<\/em>, it is not clear that such teth\u00adering would be permissible.[footnote]The legality of this proposal might turn on structural details, including the extent to which the state required such automatic price-adjustment mechanisms in REC contracting.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nOf course, the risks that <em>Hughes <\/em>and related decisions pose remain largely inchoate. As such, it is hard to know how to factor them into pressing decisions on decarbonization policy and markets. This Article\u2019s final section clarifies how states might integrate these developing risks into decisionmaking about the future of their climate change policies.\r\n<h2>IV. Implications for Current Electricity-Law Debates<\/h2>\r\nSo far, this Article has explored some dangers in using regional elec\u00adtricity markets as a tool to accomplish the \u201csocial project\u201d of decarboniza\u00adtion. At the same time, the Article does not intend to give short shrift to these markets\u2019 potency as a potential least-cost solution or as a bargaining tool in interstate climate negotiations. To evaluate these tradeoffs, section IV.A first lays out some variables to help states assess whether regional electricity-market integra\u00adtion of decarbonization objectives is in their best interest. Sections IV.B and IV.C then briefly explore options for regionalizing climate policy outside RTOs and how markets might adapt to accommodate such schemes. Finally, section IV.D examines what this Article\u2019s argu\u00adment portends for laggard states, as opposed to states taking the lead on climate change.\r\n<h3>A. Deciding Whether to Regionalize Through Electricity Markets<\/h3>\r\nThe limitations and pathologies of regional electricity markets iden\u00adtified in this Article suggest that states should assess three variables in deciding whether to aggressively pursue the integration of climate goals into these markets: (1) the relative priority of advancing least-cost solutions; (2) the evolution of legal doctrine surrounding federal\u2013state jurisdiction over electricity policy; and (3) regional politics.\r\n\r\n1. <em>Relative Priority of Least-Cost Solutions<\/em>. \u2014 Much of this Article\u2019s anal\u00adysis has centered on the ways in which state climate policies evince an understanding of decarbonization as a social project with multifaceted goals. State climate policies illustrate attention to distributional conse\u00adquences, the risks and externalities associated with various low-carbon technologies, and the ways in which transforming energy can also trans\u00adform state economies. But leading states are also pursuing ambi\u00adtious targets, which are likely to cost substantial sums to achieve.[footnote]See Ron Binz et al., Practicing Risk-Aware Electricity Regulation: What Every State Regulator Needs to Know 5\u20136 (2012), http:\/\/www.raponline.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/ceres-binzsedano-riskawareregulation-2012-apr-19.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/5RJQ-DQF5] (predicting that retail electricity prices will \u201crise sharply\u201d in the next twenty years due to the level of investment needed in the U.S. electricity sec\u00adtor); James H. Williams et al., Pathways to Deep Decarbonization in the United States 1, 24 (2014), <a href=\"http:\/\/unsdsn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/US-Deep-Decarbonization-Report.pdf\">http:\/\/unsdsn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/US-Deep-Decarbonization-Report.pdf<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/W45R-MF7Z] (estimating the median price of cutting car\u00adbon dioxide emissions 80% from 1990 levels by 2050 to be between $160 billion and $650 billion).[\/footnote] It could be that as implementation progresses, affordability will become the dominant priority for states pursuing decarbonization.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the first question state policymakers considering regional integration might ask is: How important is <em>least-cost<\/em> decarboniza\u00adtion to state residents, as compared to a more managed decarbonization trajectory that incorporates other goals? The more the scale tilts in favor of affordability as a central criterion, the greater the benefits of regional\u00adization through electricity markets.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding decarbonization as a social project also points to some useful conclusions about what kind of regional market design for decarbonization states might prefer. In particular, a Forward Clean Energy Market in which states can funnel their decarbonization prefer\u00adences into the market design presents less of a relinquishment of state control than does a region-wide climate price.[footnote]See supra section III.A for a detailed description of these two policy options.[\/footnote] Of course, a clean-energy market also presents a less thoroughly efficient solution\u2014again highlighting the importance of prioritizing state aims relating to decarbonization.\r\n\r\nOne final word regarding temporality is in order. Even if a state finds that a particular market construct for achieving decarbonization might perfectly achieve its aims at time zero, there is a long-term risk to ceding such control to the market. Given the scale of the enterprise of deep decarbonization, a state\u2019s goals and preferences regarding the shape of decarbonization may well evolve over time.[footnote]See, e.g., Weiner, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 159, at 5 (expressing concern that wholesale market integration of climate policy \u201cwould likely hinder States in adapting to changing times\u201d); cf. Mhairi Aitken, Why We Still Don\u2019t Understand the Social Aspects of Wind Power: A Critique of Key Assumptions Within the Literature, 38 Energy Pol\u2019y 1834, 1835 (2010) (noting research that regarding nuclear power plants, \u201cpublic attitudes are not stable but rather adapt and change in relation to events or changing situations\u201d).[\/footnote] If state aims change such that affordability ceases to be the priority criterion, a state may have lim\u00adited recourse once it has ceded decarbonization imperatives to the mar\u00adket, other than full-scale market exit.\r\n\r\nThis temporal constraint appears particularly acute with respect to carbon-pricing schemes, which may \u201clock in\u201d investments that states do not want their ratepayers to support.[footnote]See generally Karen C. Seto et al., Carbon Lock-in: Types, Causes, and Policy Implications, 41 Ann. Rev. Env\u2019t. &amp; Resources 425 (2016) (describing the path-dependent processes that prevent the emergence of low-carbon alternatives).[\/footnote] A regional carbon price would likely incentivize near-term investments in new combined-cycle natural gas facilities, which could displace higher-emitting fossil fuel facilities.[footnote]See Newell et al., supra note 194, at 33.[\/footnote] But states may not want a carbon-price scheme to help finance construc\u00adtion of these types of facilities, given their inability to contribute to long-term \u201cdeep decarbonization\u201d targets.[footnote]Cf. Liscow &amp; Karpilow, supra note 168, at 421\u201322 (suggesting reasons for states to target a few promising cleantech options in their climate investment).[\/footnote] States weighing market integra\u00adtion should thus carefully evaluate not only short-term goals but also the compatibility of a market scheme with their long-term aims.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Evolving Legal Risk<\/em>. \u2014 The second variable that can help shape state decisions regarding decarbonization and electricity markets is that of evolving legal risk. As traced in section III.E, the <em>Hughes <\/em>decision has opened up a new line of attack on state climate policies. How these cases play out in the coming years should influence decisions about whether to decarbonize through regional markets.\r\n\r\nConsider first the outcome in which courts give <em>Hughes <\/em>its narrowest possible reading. Courts in this instance would hold that <em>Hughes <\/em>preempts only those state policies that <em>explicitly <\/em>condition receipt of some benefit on clearing wholesale electricity markets.[footnote]Cf. Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, Nos. 17-cv-01163 &amp; 17-cv-01164, 2017 WL 3008289, at *13 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017), appeal docketed sub nom. Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Star, No. 17-2445 (7th Cir. July 17, 2017) (\u201c<em>Hughes<\/em> should not be extended to invalidate state laws that do not include an express condition, but that in practice (and when combined with other market forces), have the effect of conditioning payment on clearing the wholesale auction.\u201d).[\/footnote] In that case, states might feel more confident in ceding some authority over decarboniza\u00adtion to regional electricity markets, because they could assume such shared authority would place limited constraints upon state power. A state in this scenario would likely maintain considerable ability to shape its decarbon\u00adization trajectory, so long as complementary state policies were not explicitly conditioned on certain regional decarbonization mar\u00adket outcomes.\r\n\r\nNow consider the (in my opinion, less likely[footnote]See Peskoe, supra note 35, at 41 (\u201cRenewable portfolio standards\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. have co-existed with FERC-regulated markets for nearly two decades with little significant legal controversy.\u201d); supra note 276.[\/footnote]) outcome in which courts use the logic of <em>Hughes <\/em>to strike down RPSs, nuclear subsidies, and special procurement orders as intruding on federal jurisdiction over regional electricity markets. In that case, states would be faced with a conundrum. On the one hand, states would be left with considerably fewer climate policy options <em>other<\/em> than using regional electricity markets, since their primary policy levers to date would be impermissible. On the other hand, a decision to cede decarbonization objectives to the market would likely take even more policy options off the table, given that <em>Hughes <\/em>and its progeny in this scenario would stand for the proposition that states are prohibited from enacting a broad range of policies that too thoroughly impact regional markets. In this case, states would be faced with difficult choices between returning to the drawing board in terms of how to craft state climate policies, or giving in to the pressure to let the markets do their decarbonization work for them.\r\n\r\nFinally, consider the emerging middle-ground scenario, in which courts develop a sliding scale for determining which state policies are too closely \u201ctethered\u201d to wholesale markets.[footnote]Hughes v. Talen Energy Mktg., LLC, 136 S. Ct. 1288, 1299 (2016).[\/footnote] Early indications are that courts are likely to head in this direction. In June 2017, the Second Circuit became the first circuit court to interpret <em>Hughes<\/em>, ruling on a challenge to Connecticut\u2019s use of its procurement laws to encourage more solar energy.[footnote]See Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 2017).[\/footnote] The plaintiff in that case argued that Connecticut\u2019s procurement scheme should be preempted under the logic of <em>Hughes<\/em>, since the state was directing its utilities to enter into a specific wholesale contract and therefore interfering with federal jurisdiction over wholesale electricity pricing.[footnote]See id. at 86, 92.[\/footnote] The Second Circuit dodged the direct preemption argument, instead finding that Connecticut\u2019s law did not <em>compel<\/em> utilities to enter into contracts with the winning bidders of the procurement process.[footnote]See id. at 97\u201398.[\/footnote] The court thus left open the question of whether a state scheme that more clearly required utilities to enter into contracts with certain renewable resources would be preempted. Never\u00adtheless, the court took a moment to opine on <em>Hughes<\/em>, observing that Connecticut\u2019s scheme appears quite different from Maryland\u2019s failed pro\u00adgram, given that Connecticut\u2019s program involves traditional bilateral con\u00adtracts that are in no way conditioned on certain resources clearing the regional capacity auction.[footnote]Id. at 99, 102.[\/footnote] As such, Connecticut\u2019s contracts resemble \u201cprecisely what the <em>Hughes<\/em> court placed outside its limited holding.\u201d[footnote]Id. at 99.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nIn July 2017, U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and the Southern District of New York reached similarly limited conclu\u00adsions in dismissing lawsuits against Illinois\u2019s and New York\u2019s ZEC pro\u00adgrams.[footnote]Coal. for Competitive Elec. v. Zibelman, 272 F. Supp. 3d 554, 571 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), appeal docketed, No. 17-2654 (2d Cir. Aug. 25, 2017); Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, Nos. 17-cv-1163 &amp; 17-cv-1164, 2017 WL 3008289, at *1 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017), appeal docketed sub nom. Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Star, No. 17-2445 (7th Cir. July 17, 2017).[\/footnote] The first opinion to be issued concerned Illinois. Plaintiffs in that case argued, inter alia, that the ZEC program violated the <em>Hughes<\/em> standard for preemption because it was too closely tied to wholesale prices, since Illinois\u2019s program allowed for the price of ZECs to be adjusted based on predictions of wholesale prices.[footnote]<em>Star<\/em>, 2017 WL 3008289, at *4, *10.[\/footnote] The court rejected this argument, reasoning that basing ZEC prices on future projected wholesale prices is not an interference with the wholesale market that rises to the level of <em>Hughes<\/em>.[footnote]Id. at *11. The court also rejected an argument that receipt of ZECs was implicitly tied to participation in wholesale markets. Id. at *12\u201313.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Southern District of New York reached the same conclusion regarding that state\u2019s program. Its opinion emphasized that <em>Hughes<\/em> was focused on the \u201cimpermissible tether\u201d of required participation in the wholesale market and that New York\u2019s ZEC program required nothing of the sort.[footnote]<em>Zibelman<\/em>, 272 F. Supp. 3d at 569.[\/footnote] Moreover, the court observed, the ZEC program \u201cdoes not guarantee a certain wholesale price that displaces the market-determined price\u201d but rather simply places a separate value on the environmental attributes of nuclear.[footnote]Id. at *17. For this reason, the court found the scheme indistinguishable from RPS and RECs, which it noted FERC has long determined fall outside its jurisdiction. Id. at *13.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThe Illinois and New York decisions have been appealed to the Seventh and Second Circuits, respectively.[footnote]<em>Zibelman<\/em>, 272 F. Supp. 3d 554, appeal docketed, No. 17-2654 (2d Cir. Aug. 25, 2017); <em>Star<\/em>, 2017 WL 3008289, appeal docketed, No. 17-2445 (7th Cir. July 18, 2017).[\/footnote] These courts are now tasked with drawing a delicate line between schemes that come too close to elec\u00adtricity markets in design or in purpose[footnote]On the \u201cpurpose\u201d point, it is interesting to note that both courts highlighted this line of inquiry from <em>OneOK<\/em> and emphasized the extent to which the state ZEC programs had environmental goals that were quite distinct from wholesale-market aims. See <em>Zibelman<\/em>, 272 F. Supp. 3d at 571; <em>Star<\/em>, 2017 WL 3008289, at *10\u201311.[\/footnote] and those that stay further away from pegging their schemes to market prices and functions. The fact that this jurisprudence appears to be shaping itself around this inquiry should at least give states pause about ceding control over decarbonization to the markets. In doing so, states risk carving out more room for their poli\u00adcies to become constrained by regional markets\u2019 integration of the pro\u00adject of decarbonization.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Regional Politics<\/em>. \u2014 One final variable relevant to state decisionma\u00adking on integrating climate change aims into regional electricity mar\u00adkets is that of regional politics. This Article painted regional electricity-market governance as suffering from pathologies that are likely to yield least-common-denominator solutions.[footnote]See supra sections III.B\u2013.C.[\/footnote] This potentiality is least prob\u00adlematic in one-state RTOs like New York. That state is more likely to be able to translate its climate goals into a market-based scheme that fully reflects its decarbonization aims\u2014leaving one fewer variable for state regulators there to contend with.[footnote]Such is particularly the case if state regulators retain control over establishing the level of carbon pricing. Cf. Newell et al., supra note 194, at 22 (dodging the political ques\u00adtion of how New York\u2019s price might be set in noting that \u201c[p]olicymakers should define a process for determining the price and modifying it over time\u201d and that \u201c[t]his process could be led or informed by the NYPSC and other state agencies\u201d).[\/footnote] In multistate regions, though, the challenge of watering down is quite real. But even there, perhaps aggres\u00adsive states might use market integration as a bargaining chip in negotia\u00adtions with other states that are worried about state climate policies\u2019 desta\u00adbilizing effects on the regional market. In particular, they might suggest to a recalcitrant state: \u201cUp the ambition of your RPS five percent, or allow the market to use a higher price on carbon, and we will commit to pursuing regional decarbonization through the market.\u201d It is not clear whether laggard states see enough appeal to using electricity markets that such a promise could motivate them to greater action on climate change. But the more states find this outcome plausible, the more appealing using regional electricity markets to decarbonize might be.\r\n<h3>B. Thinking Outside the Market: State-Led Climate Policy Regionalization<\/h3>\r\nMuch of the appeal of using regional electricity markets to accom\u00adplish climate change aims comes from the opportunity they present for capitalizing on the efficiencies of a larger, regional market construct. But if that\u2019s the draw for states, then electricity markets are far from the only method available.

Generators simply factor the cost of RGGI allowances into their expenses, on which they base their bids into regional electricity markets.[footnote]See Peskoe, supra note 35, at 44. Peskoe notes, however, that RGGI, too, might face increased risk of preemption if participating states pursue a FERC-jurisdictional car\u00adbon price. See id.[\/footnote] Clearly this requirement to at least par\u00adtially internalize the costs of carbon emissions has an impact on the prices at which these generators offer electricity to the regional markets, but no one argues that it creates a distortionary effect.[footnote]See Tierney &amp; Hibbard, supra note 305, at 25 (asserting that RGGI \u201callows for seamless implementation in centralized wholesale power markets\u201d).[\/footnote] RGGI thus stands as proof that it is possible to concoct a regional pricing scheme <em>outside <\/em>the regional electricity market without causing undue interference.\r\n\r\nRGGI is not an unmitigated success\u2014otherwise, many of its partici\u00adpants would hardly now be considering building carbon pricing into their regional electricity markets. RGGI\u2019s main problem, quite simply, is that the caps that states were able to agree upon for RGGI\u2014and the resultant allowance prices\u2014have been too low to accomplish the most ambitious states\u2019 decarbonization goals.[footnote]See Memorandum of Law, supra note 154, at 6 n.12 (\u201c[T]he RGGI program is not sufficient to meet New York\u2019s 50 percent renewables and 40 percent [greenhouse gas] reduction goals, and changing RGGI to achieve more ambitious goals \u2018is not within the State\u2019s unilateral control.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted) (quoting Clean Energy Standard Order, supra note 99, at 133)).[\/footnote] Nevertheless, RGGI has functioned as a base policy upon which states can build the myriad other decarboniza\u00adtion policies discussed in this Article. And RGGI can function in this manner because a regional \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d creates no risk of wresting away state power to address decarbonization simultane\u00adously at the state level. At the same time, building upon years of trust among states, RGGI has twice succeeded in lowering its program carbon cap, thus raising the cost of allowance prices and strengthening the program\u2019s effects.[footnote]See RGGI, Summary of RGGI Model Rule Changes: February 2013, at 3 (2013), http:\/\/www.rggi.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Uploads\/Design-Archive\/Model-Rule\/2012-Program-Review-Update\/Summary_of_Model_Rule_Changes_02_07_13.pdf [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/BDS4-P46G<\/strong>]; Dale Bryk, East Coast States Strengthen Power Plant Pollution-Cutting Program, Set Model for Nation, NRDC Expert Blog (Feb. 7, 2013), http:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/experts\/\r\ndale-bryk\/east-coast-states-strengthen-power-plant-pollution-cutting-program-set-model [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/56SH-4SJH<\/strong>]; Bruce Ho &amp; Jackson Morris, RGGI Agrees to Cut Power Plant Pollution by Another 30%, NRDC Expert Blog (Aug. 23, 2017), http:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/experts\/bruce-ho\/rggi-agrees-cut-power-plant-pollution-another-30 [<strong>http:\/\/perma.cc\/V5BH-WW39<\/strong>].[\/footnote] RGGI\u2019s structure thus presents an appealing alterna\u00adtive to electricity-market integration for states intent on regionalization.\r\n\r\nA second example of regional cooperation on decarbonization out\u00adside of electricity markets comes from regional trading of RECs\u2014the renewable energy credits that utilities use to demonstrate compliance with state RPS.[footnote]See supra notes 85\u201386 and accompanying text.[\/footnote] To date, most REC markets are single state\u2014thus creating what many critics have bemoaned as unnecessarily constricted trading pools.[footnote]See Crandall, supra note 86, at 896; Davies, Power Forward, supra note 84, at 1343\u201344; Mack et al., supra note 86, at 18; Mormann, supra note 36, at 1644\u201345.[\/footnote] But the New England states have created a regional market for RECs that enlarges the pool of RECs available to create a more stable, fluid market.[footnote]See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a016-245a(b) (2017); see also Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 89\u201390 (2d Cir. 2017) (describing the program); Mack et al., supra note 86, at 20 (same).[\/footnote] They have done so through state laws that allow for gen\u00aderators to satisfy state RPS obligations with RECs purchased from any generator in the region that meets the state-specific definition of \u201crenew\u00adable,\u201d or similarly, from a renewable generator <em>outside <\/em>the New England region that can demonstrate that its renewable energy was imported into the region.[footnote]See, e.g., Vt. Pub. Serv. Dep\u2019t, Types of Renewable Energy Credits in New England: A Summary 1 (2015) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>). A renewable energy generator outside the region can satisfy this requirement with help from a regional track\u00ading system that monitors the renewable energy imported from surrounding ISOs and other entities. See id.; see also <em>Klee<\/em>, 861 F.3d at 92.[\/footnote] In this way, New England already orchestrates regional cooperation on renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThese programs suggest that regional cooperation can flourish with\u00adout having to relinquish control to quasi-private governance organiza\u00adtions that are not under state oversight. To be sure, both RGGI and New England\u2019s REC-sharing arrangement carry their own legal risk. Commentators frequently point to the dangers of both the Compact Clause[footnote]The Compact Clause prohibits states from entering \u201cinto any Agreement or Compact with another State\u201d without the consent of Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a010. But not all compacts are prohibited\u2014the critical question, as formulated by the Supreme Court in U.S. Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Comm\u2019n, 434 U.S. 452, 493 (1978), is whether the agreement increases the \u201cpolitical power\u201d of participating states.[\/footnote] and the Dormant Commerce Clause[footnote]The Dormant Commerce Clause prohibits states from enacting measures grounded in economic protectionism, which \u201cbenefit in-state economic interests by bur\u00addening out-of-state competitors.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Revenue v.

L. Rev. 1958, 1965 (2007). See generally Ferrey et al., supra note 92 (examining constitutional challenges to a feed-in tariff for renewable power).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThese risks are not theoretical\u2014both RGGI and the New England REC program have faced lawsuits on these grounds.[footnote]See North Dakota v. Heydinger, 825 F.3d 912, 920\u201321 (8th Cir. 2016) (striking down Minnesota\u2019s law providing that \u201c\u2018no person\u2019 shall \u2018import or commit to import\u2019 power from a large new energy facility located \u2018outside the state\u2019\u201d on Dormant Commerce Clause grounds).[\/footnote] But for now, courts have sided with the states. One New York case brought against RGGI on Compact Clause grounds settled;[footnote]See Consent Decree, Indeck Corinth, L.P. v. Paterson, No. 5280-09 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Dec. 23, 2009) (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review<\/em>); Christopher Rizzo, Cap-and-Trade Under Attack Around the Nation, GreenLaw Blog (June 29, 2011), http:\/\/greenlaw.blogs.pace.edu\/2011\/06\/29\/cap-and-trade-under-attack-around-the-nation [http:\/\/perma.cc\/TS9E-AA6N] (providing a report of the settlement).[\/footnote] another was thrown out on procedural grounds.[footnote]Thrun v.

Ct. 2013) (dismissing the case because \u201ccertain claims are time-barred and the remaining claims have been rendered moot\u201d).[\/footnote] New England\u2019s regional REC scheme recently received substantial validation on Dormant Commerce Clause grounds, in the same Second Circuit opinion that upheld the state\u2019s renewables procurement regime.[footnote]Allco Fin. Ltd. v. Klee, 861 F.3d 82, 86\u201387 (2d Cir. 2017). Plaintiffs alleged that the New England regional REC-sharing program harmed their interests in a Georgia solar facility, which was not allowed to sell RECs to Connecticut utilities for purposes of RPS compliance. The Second Circuit found no merit in this contention, determining that a Georgia REC and a New England REC are in fact \u201cdifferent products\u201d that can legally be treated differently. Id. at 103. Underlying this finding was the recognition that \u201cConnecticut consumers\u2019 need for a more diversified and renewable energy supply, acces\u00adsible to them directly through their regional grid or indirectly through adjacent control areas, would not be served by RECs produced\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. in Georgia.\u201d Id. at 105.[\/footnote] With these holdings in place, both a regional cap-and-trade program and a regional market for RECs appear to stand on relatively firm legal ground. Of course, it could still come to pass that RPS programs themselves get struck down or that another circuit ana\u00adlyzes regional RECs\u2019 constitutionality differently. But the legal risk inher\u00adent in pursuing these types of regional solutions comes for states with an attendant gain\u2014not having to relinquish public control over the course and content of these important decarbonization programs.\r\n<h3>C. Designing Markets to Accommodate, Rather than Achieve, State Policies<\/h3>\r\nThe problem, of course, with pursuing regional solutions outside markets is that it returns the states to the problem animating current dis\u00adputes: the fact that extra-market solutions, whether pursued at the regional or state level, may distort and ultimately dismantle electricity markets.[footnote]See supra section I.C.[\/footnote] Here, then, a separate set of proposals for how to manage these concerns is salient. While many are deep in exploration of how to use electricity markets to <em>achieve<\/em> decarbonization, there is a second strand of proposed reforms that would focus on redesigning electricity markets not to subsume state climate policies but merely to <em>accommodate <\/em>them. Such accommodation would require regional markets to embrace the coexistence of manifold state policies in a way that has not always been the case to date and to intentionally mold their rules to support the con\u00adtinued viability of markets in the face of these state policies.[footnote]To be fair, regions have already been doing some accommodation for years, through policies such as exemptions from the \u201cminimum offer price rule,\u201d Kavulla, supra note 56, which requires that \u201cnew generators bid\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. at or above a specified price in certain circumstances,\u201d Rossi, Brave New Path, supra note 36, at 424. See also N.J. Bd. of Pub. Utils. v. FERC, 744 F.3d 74, 85\u201386, 93\u201394 (3d Cir. 2014) (describing the minimum offer price rule and upholding PJM\u2019s determination not to exempt state-supported resources from it any longer). But the current suite of accommodations is clearly inade\u00adquate, given the worries documented about wholesale market interference in this Article.[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nThere are many ideas about how markets might be refined to better accommodate state climate policies, and most proposals tend to be quite technical. The basic idea behind them, though, is this: Regions should identify what current market signals are failing to achieve, and rework the market construct to achieve these aims. That might be through pric\u00ading some \u201cattribute\u201d of electricity that markets do not currently value\u2014for example, markets might pay generators for their ability to \u201cramp\u201d up and down quickly to balance out renewables.[footnote]MISO and CAISO have introduced \u201cramping products,\u201d which compensate resources for their ability to ramp up and down quickly. Chang et al., supra note 119, at 25.

Cf. Hogan, supra note 121, at 8 (pointing out some of the challenges with this strategy).[\/footnote] Or, it might be through redesigning capacity markets to pay different prices to state-supported resources\u2014like renewables and nuclear energy\u2014and resources that are unsupported by these policies.[footnote]See PJM, Capacity Market Repricing Proposal 1 (2017) [hereinafter PJM, Repricing Proposal], <a href=\"http:\/\/pjm.com\/~\/media\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/2\">http:\/\/pjm.com\/~\/media\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/2<\/a>0170502-\r\ncapacity-market-repricing-proposal.ashx\/ [http:\/\/perma.cc\/K2UQ-CB3P] (pro\u00adposing a \u201ctwo-stage capacity auction\u201d in which state-supported resources are allowed to clear the market but do not set the price to be paid to other resources); Peskoe, supra note 35, at 16 (detailing these proposals); see also NEPOOL, Framework Document Two-Tier FCM Pricing 1\u20132 (2016), <a href=\"http:\/\/nepool.com\/uploads\/IMAPP_20160914_Framework_NRG_r\">http:\/\/nepool.com\/uploads\/IMAPP_20160914_Framework_NRG_\r\nr<\/a>ev.pdf [http:\/\/perma.cc\/GND8-FM36] (describing a two-stage forward capac\u00adity auction); CMEEC, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 240, at 4 (proposing alternatively a \u201cbilateral-residual capacity market structure\u201d); American Municipal Power, FERC Technical Conference, supra note 112, at 4 (same).

Many believe that state-supported renewables might actually enhance grid resiliency.

At best, FERC may use the proposed rule as a jumping-off point for redesigning markets in a way that truly helps RTOs better accommo\u00addate state climate change policies. If this path is taken, then state and regional policies will cause less friction for markets going forward\u2014ren\u00addering robust state decarbonization policies less problematic. At worst, certain RTOs might use the proposed rule as an invitation to create their own subsidy schemes aimed at propping up aging coal and nuclear for reasons unrelated to climate change aims\u2014and in large part, in direct contravention of them.[footnote]For example, in November 2017, the mid-Atlantic RTO, PJM, proposed a \u201cprice reformation\u201d program that would allow for \u201cinflexible\u201d (that is, slow-ramping) units to set the market price so as to better reflect \u201cthe true incremental cost to serve load.\u201d PJM, Proposed Enhancements to Energy Price Formation 1\u20132 (2017), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pjm.com\/-\/media\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/20171115-proposed-enhancements-to-energy-price-formation.ashx\">http:\/\/www.pjm.com\/-\/\r\nmedia\/library\/reports-notices\/special-reports\/20171115-proposed-enhancements-to-energy-price-formation.ashx<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/HQ9P-NPBA] (defining \u201cinflexible units\u201d as \u201cthose with declining average costs that are unable to economically produce power within a certain range or that require an economic minimum output\u201d). This proposal is more market oriented than the DOE-proposed rule, but it still differentiates resources based on \u201cinflexibility\u201d in ways that do not appear fully justified.

Twenty-odd years ago, FERC created RTOs as a grand experi\u00adment in new ways to manage electricity.[footnote]See Regional Transmission Organizations, 65 Fed. Reg. 810, 811 (Dec. 20, 1999) (codified at 18 C.F.R. pt. 35) (establishing RTOs).[\/footnote] But we have moved beyond the early, experimental stage of RTOs\u2019 existence. If their initial governance structures turn out not to serve states well, perhaps it is time to consider not only tweaking market design to accommodate state policies but also more dramatically reforming RTO governance itself. There is not enough space in this section to consider the possibilities and practicalities of pursuing these larger reforms, but hopefully the concerns raised here will prompt fur\u00adther inquiries in this vein.\r\n<h3>B. But What About the Laggards?<\/h3>\r\nThis Article focuses on a conundrum facing states that are leading the way in addressing climate change, arguing that they should cling to the right to shape their decarbonization trajectories. In articulating this argument, this Article has attempted to sketch the ways in which decar\u00adbonization is a \u201csocial\u201d project, requiring care in crafting its contours rather than merely its end game.\r\n\r\nBut the primary problem confronting state climate change policy today isn\u2019t the underappreciated \u201csocial nature\u201d of decarbonization. The bigger problem is the fact that a good many citizens\u2014and state govern\u00adments\u2014deny the existence of climate change and refuse to do much of anything to promote decarbonization. Laggard states not only do little to address climate change within their own boundaries but also actively impede efforts at federal climate change policies.[footnote]See, e.g., Samantha Page, 26 Attorneys General Are Suing the EPA. The Public Only Agrees with Them in 3 States, ThinkProgress (Nov. 3, 2015), <a href=\"http:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/26-attorneys-general-are-suing-the-epa-the-public-only-agrees-with-them-in-3-states-e935d36e42ba\">http:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/\r\n26-attorneys-general-are-suing-the-epa-the-public-only-agrees-with-them-in-3-states-e935d36e42ba<\/a> [http:\/\/perma.cc\/M9F6-U7D9] (providing a map of the twenty-six states suing the Environmental Protection Agency to halt implementation of the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d to address greenhouse gas emissions).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nFor those who care about action on climate change, then, this Article\u2019s argument that we should leave states to shape their own policies might seem to create a critical downside: Leaving the aims of energy pol\u00adicy to state legislators and regulators means accepting whatever ends they democratically determine, be they climate change goals or coal mine job preservation goals. Such risks are not hypothetical: Ohio has already pur\u00adsued efforts to provide supplementary ratepayer funds to several coal plants at risk of retirement,[footnote]See Elec. Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. AEP Generation Res., Inc., 155 FERC \u00b6 61,102 (Apr. 27, 2016), 2016 WL 1717028, at *11\u201312 (rejecting an attempt by Ohio generators to pass through the costs of supporting certain in-state coal generation to captive ratepayers).[\/footnote] and there is considerable interest under the present Administration in protecting \u201cbaseload power\u201d from renewa\u00adble energy.[footnote]See Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 46,940, 46,941\u201345 (Oct. 10, 2017) (to be codified at 18 C.F.R. pt. 35).[\/footnote] This interest may prompt more states to enact policies that seek to support not particular clean-energy sources but particular <em>dirty<\/em>-energy sources.[footnote]See Kavulla, supra note 56 (observing that such state laws \u201care proliferat\u00ading, and they are not limited to renewables but whatever a legislature might prefer\u201d).[\/footnote]\r\n\r\nSuch is these states\u2019 right in a federalist system with no overarching federal climate policy.[footnote]Of course, should the Clean Power Plan\u2014the Obama-era regulation that sets greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets for each state\u2014ultimately persist, it will act as a \u201cfloor\u201d below which no state can go in terms of climate change policy. See Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units, 80 Fed. Reg. 64,662, 64,662 (Oct. 23, 2015) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. pt. 60). The D.C. Circuit is currently entertaining a challenge to the regulations, which President Trump has announced his ambition to withdraw. See Order at 2, West Virginia v. EPA, No. 15-1363 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28, 2017) (granting a sixty-day stay of litigation); Exec. Order No. 13,783, 82 Fed. Reg. 16,093, 16,094\u201396 (Mar. 31, 2017) (mandating the suspension, revi\u00adsion, or rescission of numerous federal climate change reform plans).[\/footnote] This state schism on climate change thus creates a powerful argument in favor of federal action, which could bind all states to achieving progress on decarbonization.[footnote]See Jonathan B. Wiener, Think Globally, Act Globally: The Limits of Local Climate Policies, 155 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1961, 1962 (2007) (\u201c[S]ubnational state-level action is not the best way to combat global climate change. This is true even assuming that fore\u00adstalling global climate change is of utmost importance, and even where the state-level poli\u00adcies are individually well designed.\u201d).[\/footnote] But these arguments are orthogonal to this Article\u2019s inquiry, which is of a narrower scope: Given the fact that no federal climate policy is likely to be forthcoming soon, should states seeking to decarbonize work together through their regional electricity markets to do so?\r\n\r\nUsing RTOs to address decarbonization simply does not have the same power to pull along laggard states. Because of RTOs\u2019 voluntary membership and stakeholder-governance processes, laggard states would be perfectly capable of blocking any RTO decarbonization proposals that required them to go above and beyond on climate.[footnote]See supra sections III.B\u2013.C.[\/footnote] And even if a region were to figure out a way to allow certain of its members to pursue decarbonization goals absent full regional participation,[footnote]Cf. PJM, Advancing Zero Emissions Objectives, supra note 190, at 2 (proposing that a subregion of states within PJM could pursue carbon pricing, although these might have to be contiguous states).[\/footnote] such cooperative action would not stop other states in the region from pursuing poli\u00adcies aimed at propping up carbon-intensive resources.[footnote]There might be a legal differentiation, however, between state policies aimed at decarbonizing and state policies aimed specifically at keeping old plants from retiring simply to preserve jobs and economic benefits to the state. The latter type of state policy might be more vulnerable to a Dormant Commerce Clause challenge than state envi\u00adronmental initiatives. Cf. Vill. of Old Mill Creek v. Star, Nos. 17-cv-01163 &amp; 17-cv-01164, 2017 WL 3008289, at *16 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2017) (accepting the environmental purpose of Illinois\u2019s ZEC program but hinting that a program aimed exclusively at in-state economic benefits would be vulnerable on these grounds).[\/footnote] Accordingly, although state polarization argues for <em>federal <\/em>action, it does not lend force to pro\u00adposals to regionalize decarbonization policy through electric\u00adity markets.[footnote]Unless, of course, a laggard state is willing to up its ambition as a condition of other states proceeding through the market construct\u2014a contingency accounted for in my three variables. See supra section IV.A.[\/footnote]\r\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\r\nScholars, regulators, and market participants all recognize that elec\u00adtricity markets, in their current form, do not incentivize the rapid decar\u00adbonization of the electricity sector necessary to respond to climate change, thereby forcing states to act on their own. This realization has provoked conversations at FERC, at RTOs, and among states as to whether these markets should be redesigned to accomplish states\u2019 cli\u00admate change goals. This Article has questioned the use of redesigned electricity markets as a driver of decarbonization in the United States. In particular, this Article has pointed out the ways in which decarbonizing electricity is a social project that should be managed by politically accountable entities, working through public processes capable of chan\u00adneling and incorporating numerous goals related to decarbonization.\r\n\r\nThose who are committed exclusively to the most rapid decarboniza\u00adtion possible are unlikely to be persuaded by this argument. It is true that in the present political climate, using electricity markets to respond to climate change would be an expedient and efficient pathway forward. Nevertheless, this Article has highlighted the risks that attend expedi\u00adency. If climate change policy is shunted into these markets rather than left open for public debate, states will have lost a significant amount of control over <em>how <\/em>decarbonization proceeds. Instead, these decisions will be made in quasi-private governance institutions with complex voting rules and opaque power structures, under murky jurisdictional bounda\u00adries that may make it hard for states to assert concordant control.\r\n\r\nThe technical intricacies inherent in discussions over integrating cli\u00admate policies and regional electricity markets often drive participants to put aside larger questions regarding the animating forces of climate pol\u00adicy\u2014at great peril. Debates over using electricity markets to accomplish decarbonization should in fact highlight the question of why climate change is a problem in the first place. After all, civilizations have crumbled and species have gone extinct due to climatic changes.[footnote]See Jared Diamond, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed 77\u2013308 (2005) (documenting and theorizing the collapse of many past societies); Elizabeth Kolbert, The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History 101\u201304 (2014).[\/footnote] For many, the answer to this question is that the continued peaceful existence of humans on Earth\u2014and the minimization of their suffering\u2014is a worthy aim.[footnote]See Dale Jamieson, Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle Against Climate Change Failed\u2014And What It Means for Our Future 164\u201367, 179 (2014) (exploring this rationale for climate action and the challenges it presents for \u201ccommonsense\u201d morality and concluding that the task at hand is \u201cto live in productive relationship with the dynamic systems that govern a changing planet\u201d); see also Steven C. Sherwood &amp; Matthew Huber, An Adaptability Limit to Climate Change Due to Heat Stress, 107 Proc. Nat\u2019l Acad. Sci. U.S. 9552, 9552 (2010) (explaining why an uninhabitable planet is a distinct pos\u00adsibility, since a temperature increase of around 7\u00b0C would \u201ccall[] the habitability of some regions into question\u201d for humans, and that \u201c[w]ith 11\u201312\u00b0C warming,\u201d most of \u201chuman population as currently distributed\u201d would reside in uninhabitable regions).[\/footnote] If the project of decarbonization is in service of the continued wellbeing of humanity\u2014and, potentially, species beyond humans[footnote]See Kolbert, supra note 349, at 268 (arguing that humans are not \u201cwhat\u2019s most worth attending to\u201d); Jedediah Purdy, After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene 249, 272 (2015) (arguing that understanding our present world as one where there is no \u201cnature\u201d apart may open space for reimagining a \u201cpost-humanism\u201d that gives all forms of life equal value).[\/footnote]\u2014it must be part of a larger social conversation about how we want to live in communities in the future. These conversations are worth preserving for the public forum, in which debate, dissent, experimentation, and long-term social visions can continue to develop within and alongside decarboniza\u00adtion policies in the coming decades.",
