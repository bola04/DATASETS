              With the help of the Couch to 5k program, In less 
                         than seven months, I went from a 47 year old, 104kg, 30 cigarettes 
                         a day sort of guy to an 82kg, 0 cigarettes, running 45 to 50 kilometers 
                         a week sort of guy. Ten months after finishing C25K I completed 
                         my first marathon. Since then I have run another 5 marathons, 
                         as well as 9 ultra marathons including three over 100km.

              Its secret is that it's a gentle introduction to 
                         getting the body moving, starting off alternating between walking 
                         and running small distances, and slowly building up until after 
                         8 weeks, you're ready to run 5 kilometers or 30 minutes non stop.

              The reason for putting this site together is to 
                       try to create the definitive Couch to 5k resource on the web. 
                       For the novice, there's a lot of information available...it's 
                       just a matter of trying to find it all. That's where c25k.com 
                       will hopefully help. I've tried to collate links to just about 
                       all of the information you'll need for the Couch to 5k program, 
                       plus some other sites that I've found fantastic to assist my running 
                       after graduating from C25K.

                 musical cue ... and the bpm changing from an obvious jogging speed

           The guys in the forum decided they would like C25K Shirts to wear

                 Note that I have recently changed the shop from CafePress to Zazzle, 
                 as Zazzle offer micro fibre running shirts. Zazzle pays a 10% 
               commission, so I will donate that to a worthwhile cause.
