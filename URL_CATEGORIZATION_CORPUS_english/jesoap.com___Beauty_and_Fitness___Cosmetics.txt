     is located in the northeastern part of Vermont, one of the six New England States, affectionately known locally as the Northeast Kingdom.  We have been making our fine personal care products for over twenty-three years and have many satisfied customers worldwide, including thirteen years of exporting our products to Japan.

     We specialize in pH balanced, handmade soaps, all natural herbal insect repellents, including a special one for ticks, therapeutic salves and sprays (try our W-Itch Away Spray to relieve the itch of poison ivy and bug bites); aromatherapy oils including massage, one for sinus problems, and one for sore, achy muscles, car fresheners, lavender sachets, all natural moisturizers and therapeutic salve for psoriasis and eczema, just to name a few.  We love making these products for you and are devoted to helping people who have problem skin.  Special pains are taken to ensure that all of our products are of the finest quality.

     Along with Jean Elizabeth's, we are now also known as

               Harmony
     </strong>
     . Herbal Harmony was born to help people herbally.  We specialize in one-on-one consultations, herbal workshops, and making herbal teas and compounds.  Our herbs are either organic or wildcrafted - no chemicals are used in any of our herbal products.  It is fun and satisfying to help people, and we are passionate about that.
