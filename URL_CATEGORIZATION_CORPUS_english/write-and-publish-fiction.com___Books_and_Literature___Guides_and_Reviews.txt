        In my life long quest to publish my own fiction novels, through trial
  and error, I've learned a great deal of information about fiction 
 writing. It's difficult to find some of this information when you need 
 it, so I decided to put it all together in one place so it is easy for 
 you to find.
       </p>
       <p>
        This site is a ten year compilation of the things I researched (and continue to research) and learned over the years in order to publish my own fiction novels and how-to books. I know every single topic on this site will be very helpful to you if your goal is to get your fiction writing published.

        Something compelling happened to me while I was deployed for seven months out to sea on a submarine while in the Navy. Isolated from civilization and unable to communicate with the real world for what seemed like forever, I had a lot of time to think about why so many people fail to follow through with writing and publishing fiction. By following through, I mean that they don't go on to make money with it!
       </p>
       <p>
        As a fiction writer myself, I totally understand the frustration going through the entire writing process from start to finish just to end up with a stack of papers collecting dust on the book shelf or in a plastic container in the garage.

       <p>
        As a writer, you face several difficult challenges throughout the course of your writing and most of them come as soon as you are done writing! Whether it's coming up with ideas for your writing, putting your words into the correct context that flows for your readers, publishing your completed project, or marketing your fiction once it's published, you have questions, blocks, and other obstacles that make your job as a fiction writer downright difficult!

        For some writers, even if they are fortunate enough to write and publish fiction, they lack the knowledge and understanding of marketing and don't have a clue how to get their fiction books out to the world once they get their book published,

Without finding this information I probably would not have even embarked on this journey basically for lack of not knowing 1) How to start, 2) How to continue, and 3) how to proceed. I had no idea there was even such a thing as self-publishing."

      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
       Write and Publish Fiction is going through some great changes that will help everyone in all areas of fiction writing. I am streamlining the site to be more easily navigated and easier to find the information you are looking for. More content, less advertisements. And best of all - all FREE information.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
       If you can't find something,
       <a href="http://www.write-and-publish-fiction.com/contact.html" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">
        please let me know
       </a>
       and I will add it to the site or tell you how to find it. My goal is to help you write and publish your fiction. Let's do it together.
