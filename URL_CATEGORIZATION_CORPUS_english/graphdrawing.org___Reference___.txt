       <i>
        Graph Drawing
       </i>
       is concerned with the geometric representation of
 graphs and networks and is motivated by those applications where it
 is crucial to visualize structural information as graphs.
       <br/>
       Since graph drawing methods form the algorithmic core of network
 visualization, bridging the gap between theoretical advances and
 implemented solutions is an important aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       This site is a collection of resources mostly related to the annual
       <i>
        International Symposium 
 on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization
       </i>
       , but we anticipate the inclusion of, e.g., an overview of software tools in
 the future.

 Kozo Sugiyama, one of the founders of Graph Drawing, passed away on
 Friday, June 10, 2011.  His work in the late 1970s and early 1980s
 is fundamental to many of the methods that we use daily nowadays.
 To quote Peter Eades, who first learned the sad news: &ldquo;The
 young people of Graph Drawing know his work.  Older people, such as
 myself, remember him as a colleague.  It is a great loss.&rdquo;

In particular, the committee will include new members voted by the GD community. Also, as founding members voluntarily step down over time, the committee will eventually consist only of members with a 3-year term, some elected by the GD community and others appointed by the committee itself.
