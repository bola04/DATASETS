     I've been a tutor in Tulsa off and on since 1991, a college chemistry and physics teacher, and a full-time private tutor for over 6 years. I started tutoring at Tulsa Jr College (now TCC). As a Tulsa Tutor I've worked with all ages, high school students, college students from TCC, ORU, TU, OU, &amp; OSU, veterans programs, and the Oklahoma voc. rehab. program. I've helped many students in Tulsa pass their classes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The approach I take is to emphasize the basics such as unit conversions, conversion factors, and stoichiometry, because these are truly the heart of chemistry and without this understanding the student will certainly struggle.  I have flowcharts and instructions that help anyone to understand the conversion process from volume to mass, mass to moles, moles to molecules or atoms, etc.  From there I like to build on this solid foundation.  I know that many chemistry students who come to me for tutoring are to the point where they are already struggling and are far along in the class, so I try to teach the basics as I’m working through the more advanced material such as thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibrium, acids and bases, coordination chemistry, nuclear chemistry, organic chemistry, etc.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Many students come to me as a way to just improve their grades through homework help, as a sort of homework cheat.  While I do my best to make sure the student turns in good homework, I also try to discourage cheating and focus on learning the material so that the student will do well on exams.  At the same time, I know that not everyone enjoys or needs chemistry in their every day life or work.  I do my best to make it interesting with interesting chemistry facts or stories and safety precautions to follow in the home and laboratory... and give students with the homework help they need at the same time. This way they see that chemistry can be useful and interesting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I’ve also given quite a bit of help to students who are taking online chemistry classes who need complicated material clarified and cannot get that from the website such as WebAssign or CourseCompass.  This can be done through email, or chat.  I can also help you find a chemistry tutor in your town. Or just click the "Find a Tutor" option at the top of the page.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My favorite approach to tutoring is to try to allow the students to do as much of the work as they possibly can by themselves and I coach them along and do my best to smooth over the rough spots.  I do not have a “method” or “strategy” for tutoring because each student is an individual.  I don’t waste time with “evaluation” or “screening” because I can typically tell within 10 or 15 minutes of the tutoring session the level of learning the student has.  I get right to work from the first couple of minutes with a student.

        I've been a tutor in Tulsa off and on since 1991, a college chemistry and physics teacher, and a full-time private tutor for over 6 years. I started tutoring at Tulsa Jr College (now TCC). As a Tulsa Tutor I've worked with all ages, high school students, college students from TCC, ORU, TU, OU, &amp; OSU, veterans programs, and the Oklahoma voc. rehab. program. I've helped many students in Tulsa pass their classes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I can provide tutoring and homework help in all basic math, geometry, algebra, trig – trigonometry, and calculus problems, as well as basic statistics, differential equations, and finite math. These different classes require several different approaches.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Many students try to get me just provide homework help and use my services as a homework cheat service and I try to discourage this because the students need to know the material to pass the exams. However, I do my best to make sure the student turns in good homework. I prefer to work with the student and have them do as much of the work themselves as possible, and I try to smooth over the rough areas - I prefer when the student takes an interst in learning as opposed to just wanting homework help and I do my best to spark an interest by applying math to something that holds the students interest.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I’ve also given quite a bit of help to students who are taking online math classes who need complicated material clarified and cannot get that from the website such as WebAssign or CourseCompass.  This can be done through email, or chat. I also provide help with online classes. Some students will try to use this as an way to cheat in online classes, but I try to provide help so that the students will learn and not just use this as an "online class cheat".

        <b>
         Basic math and intro to algebra
        </b>
        I focus on "practice makes perfect" and correct order of operations. One good way to get students to practice the basics is, I think, online math games. I have college students who still struggle w/ basic multiplication tables! This is just really memorization which can be helped through memory improving games. In basic math I can provide homework help in fractions, least common denominators, adding and subtracting negative numbers, long division, long multiplication, decimals, etc. This is all you need for your online class cheating.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>
         High school algebra and college algebra
        </b>
        covers a wide range of topics! I try to take a more intuitive and graphical approach to algebra tutoring.  Learning to graph equations is the key to understanding almost all of these topics.  The TI-83, TI-84, and TI-89 calculators can greatly help in this area! And they are also good for solving systems of linear equations and matrix math.  Any good math tutor can show you how to make the best use of your calculator. As a math tutor I provide homework help in: equations of a line, slope-intercept, factoring, the quadratic formula, polynomials, functions y = f(x), inverse functions, graphing rational expressions, translation of graphs, inequalities, systems of equations, matrices, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, conic sections, circles, matrices, Descartes rule of signs, possible rational roots, etc., etc.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>
         Geometry
        </b>
        can be difficult because it seems so easy and simple on the surface, but when it actually comes to proving a theorem or statement, things get to be a bit tricky! I focus more on logic and proof strategies than I do any specific problem or memorizing formulas, although those are also important, usually students don't struggle too much with the simple formulas. It's the proof-solving that gets to be a real killer in this class!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>
         Trigonometry ("Trig")
        </b>
        starts fairly simple, but quickly becomes a real bear.  It is important that students understand the early part of trig, the unit circle and basic trig functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent). The key to trig is really just the Pythagorean Theorem and understanding that the trig functions are just ratios with triangles. Many students struggle with trig identities and solving trigonometric equations. And in tutoring I can show students strategies how to overcome these problems. I also provide tutoring with trigonometry involving complex numbers, the law of sines and the law of cosines.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>
         Calculus
        </b>
        is one of the more difficult topics offered at high school or college and it really requires a good understanding of algebra and usually trig (with the exception of most business calculus classes. All math builds on what came before. Most of the mistakes made in calculus are not calculus mistakes, but algebra mistakes. As a math tutor, I do my best helping students avoid these mistakes. I also show strategies for differentiation, such as the power rule, quotient rule, chain rule, etc., as well as integration techniques, such as integration by parts, by partial fractions, trigonometric substitution, etc. I also tutor the more advanced calculus such as vector and 3D calculus. Most math tutors do not cover those topics. I also occasionally tutor basic
        <b>
         differential equations
        </b>
        , the math class just after calculus. I can also show students how to use a TI-89 calculator and/or "Derive 6" (a computer program) which will solve many calculus and algebra problems!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Lastly I tutor the more business oriented classes of
        <b>
         Finite Math &amp; Statistics
        </b>
        .  Unfortunately these classes rely heavily on memorizing formulas and usually calculators or spreadsheet programs.  These classes focus more on application rather than theory and are geared toward business, behavioral science and research, etc. A good math teacher or math tutor will try to take examples from an area that captures the student's interest.

         As a physics tutor, I focus heavily on showing students how to make drawings of their physics problems and I insist that they try this themselves. A picture is worth 1000 words and if the student can draw the picture, they will have a much better understanding of what the problem is asking.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I provide homework help with the following topics:
         <br/>
         Equations of Motion (Kinematics), Newton’s first Law, Newton’s 2nd Law, F = ma, torque, rotational motion, acceleration, angular acceleration, work, W = Fd, Power, P = W/t, Thermodynamics, relativity, Newtonian motion, vector addition (both graphically and analytically), cross product, dot product, balancing forces, equilibrium, balancing torques, etc.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Physics II (or the 2nd half of high school physics) is quite a bit different from physics I in that it deals with electricity and magnetism which is very difficult to visualize (and also to draw!), and so it is important that the student understands all the tricks to visualizing (and drawing!) these unfamiliar forces.  I provide homework help with electric Fields, electric potential, electric forces, electric flux, circuits, and magnetism.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I provide tutoring and homework help in high school physics, general physics, and calculus based physics for engineers.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I prefer that the student doesn't use my tutor service as a way to cheat or just get "homework help"- students need to understand the material to pass the exams! However, I do my best to make sure the student turns in good homework.
