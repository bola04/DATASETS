             After a tragic day years ago, Beth Carter was left to pick up the pieces and move on with her life. But she hasn't. She's shut herself to the world, and has vowed never to love again.

             Matt Taylor is looking for work, but nothing more. His life is complicated enough with three burdens and a difficult past that won't go away. When Matt arrives at Beth's Garden Nursery to ask for a job, he meets its beautiful owner, and over time, finds something he hadn't expected. Surrounded by plants with fancy names, all Matt has to offer is a scarred heart-- that, and homegrown dandelions.

          As a survivor of abuse, Terry Davis is determined to make a difference in someone's life the way his best friend, John Johannes,
 		had changed Terry's so many years ago on a school playground. Having seen John's daughter, Abigail, rescue Jake Murphy from Jake's
 		tortured past, Terry is more intent than ever to offer a lifeline of his own to someone in desperate need.
 		But it won't be easy.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Protective of Terry's wounds, John has tried to keep his friend from helping anyone too much, knowing from Terry's former
 		experience as a volunteer hotline crisis counselor that Terry's nightmares would return. Then she arrived in all her painful
 		helplessness-- Madison Crawford with the haunting gray eyes and secretive past, needing to be rescued while claiming to need no one.
 		As Terry tries to help Madison and then becomes involved with her on a more personal level, John's concerns deepen for the dear
 		friend he loves like a brother.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This may be Terry's journey, but Terry won't be making it alone.

 				out a little early and so disappointed when it is only on time. I grew tired of researching, dissecting and evaluating writings for literary value and content. I 
 				have grown to love the feeling that you incorporate into your stories and Terry's Journey promises to move you further into a skill that is becoming so very 
 				honed. Thank you for you efforts. Thank you for your heart. Thank you for

          After a tragic day years ago, Beth Carter was left to pick up the pieces and move on with her life. But she hasn't. She's

          Matt Taylor is looking for work, but nothing more. His life is complicated enough with three burdens and a difficult past

 		time, finds something he hadn't expected. Surrounded by plants with fancy names, all Matt has to offer is a scarred 
 		heart-- that, and homegrown dandelions.

             "Three days ago, my friend introduced me to 'Abigail's Journey'. I remember her 
 				exact words were: 'It is beyond words!'. Not stressing much on what that entailed and being a passionate 
 				reader, I eagerly ventured into page 1 and from there on, I couldn't find the heart to stop. I was eager to 
 				get to the end and at the same time I dreaded the fact that this novel that captured my heart, mind, and soul 
 				would come to a finale and leave behind it emptiness and an insatiable hunger for more. For three nights, I 
 				lived with Abigail and Jake, and walked through this incredible journey of self realization, fear, hurt, love, 
 				passion, empathy, and most importantly a reminder of how Good God Is. I cannot begin to relay the emotions that 
 				hunted me so vigorously, smiling at times and crying at others, all of which while nourishing my heart and 
 				increasing my faith in the Lord. It has renewed my faith in the Lord and how mysterious his Ways are. At many 
 				times in my life, fear and doubt presided within me, leaving so little to hope. But it is through the Lord 
 				that we find strength once more to ask of him to guide us into the light and unto a rock that is higher than 
 				where we are. May God bless you, and always give you the strength to empower and inspire others. I thank God 
 				for you and for your talent and most of all for your faith, without which this would not be possible."

          Middle-aged Adam Clark is a confirmed bachelor, settled in his ways with no hope of ever changing. But this unassuming Master 
 		Plumber has a big secret that not even Charlie can anticipate, and when it comes to light, no one in their small town will 
 		ever be the same again.

             "I just finished reading 'The Greatest of These', and it is a wonderful 
 				book. I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know both Charlie and Adam, and their family. I have read 
 				all of the other books you have on this site, and I have to say that 'The Greatest of These', is by 
 				far my favorite. I guess because it is not just focused on a love story, it is about life. Not only do 
 				you get to know Adam and Charlie, you also get to experience their pain and their happiness. I can't 
 				wait for your next book. Thank you so much for sharing your books online. God has given you a wonderful 
 				talent. God Bless you for sharing His Word through your books."
