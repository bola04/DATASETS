The Coltons and Gages have feuded for generations; Carson is convinced the cowgirl is hiding his prime suspect on her ranch. But the beauty and her baby stir unwelcome yearnings in his calloused heart. After all, Carson has learned the hard way what vulnerability can cost. When Serena and her child become targets of a mysterious assailant, Carson’s protective urges take over. Can an irresistible attraction prove stronger than old family hatreds and help them capture a criminal?

          Recently divorced and fleeing her abusive ex-husband, Amy needs a safe place to hide and someone she can trust. And she’s not alone. Her fussy six-month-old son needs sanctuary, too…and Connor is determined to protect them both. It’s not his family, but it’s the family—and the woman—he’s always wanted. So when Amy’s jealous ex tracks her down, hell-bent on reclaiming his “property,” Connor’s ready to fight this time…

          It’s supposed to be the final confrontation. Philly detective Tate Colton will go under cover to bust the sex trafficking ring targeting young Amish women. He doesn’t count on his sting operation falling apart—or being forced to escape with the breathtaking key witness he’s sworn to protect.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hiding in New York City with a handsome detective? Amish seamstress Hannah Troyer’s more than a little out of her element. The big city—and men like Tate—are part of a world that’s nothing like what she’s used to. As danger inches closer, he’s her only route to safety…and a forbidden attraction she dares to indulge in.

         </p>
         <p>
          The only woman that Cole’s been that close to is Stacy Rowe—the one he cared for deeply, and deeply regrets losing. But Stacy hasn’t been in Forever in…forever. Eight months, to be exact. And while the math adds up, nothing else does! She would never abandon two little babies that way—she’s said as much. But she does seem awfully keen to help him care for them. And the closer their odd little family grows, the more Cole has to wonder…

          Ever since her mother died, nurse practitioner Kayley Quartermain has been searching for somewhere to belong. She wants that somewhere to be her hometown of Bedford, but first she needs a job. Thankfully, her matchmaking godmother offers a solution: a career match—and hopefully a romantic one, too—assisting recently widowed Dr. Luke Dolan at his clinic.
         </p>
         <p>
          Still adjusting to life as a single dad, Luke is reluctant to accept Kayley’s help. Sure, she’s great at her job, and five-year-old Lily adores her, but Luke’s developing strong feelings for Kayley, too. For Lily’s sake, he needs to be careful about whom he lets in. But with Kayley fitting in so perfectly as they rebuild their lives, could she be the one piece they’ve been missing?

         <p>
          For homicide detective Ronan Cavanaugh O’Bannon, this time it’s personal…and totally baffling! The body of a police friend is found executed in the same manner as rival gang members. There’s no progress in finding Aurora’s serial killer…until Sierra Carlyle joins the team.
         </p>
         <p>
          The perky young newbie is as chatty and extroverted as Ronan is taciturn and closed off. Frankly, she irritates him, but she’s a brilliant, relentless investigator. Working together, facing danger, Sierra’s warmth begins to thaw Ronan’s iciness. But acting on their undeniable attraction proves unwise now. There’s a killer to find and stop…before he sets his sights on a Cavanaugh!

         <p>
          Detective Bryce Cavanaugh already has one tough investigation—an elusive home-invasion team on a dangerous crime spree. And his enigmatic fellow cop Alexandra “Scottie” Scott keeps throwing him curves. She’s relentless at taking charge—and running down leads. But getting the stunning blonde to reveal her secrets is a challenge Bryce just can’t resist.

          Scottie prefers to solve cases and save those close to her on her own. Keeping one step ahead of Bryce’s hardheaded persistence is difficult enough. But tension-filled nights and high-adrenaline days are only fueling the passion between them and putting an inescapable target on their backs!
