Maybe one of his ideas is about a guy who wishes he had his friend’s girlfriend and it leads to all kinds of funny/serious complications, but it all resolves in the end, and he has grown as a person.  Or maybe it’s something else completely.

        TRUBYVILLE (Classic Post)
       </a>
      </h1>
      <div class="post-inner">
       <a href="http://thinkingwriter.com/?p=95">
       </a>
       <p>
        I wish formulas worked.  God, I wish they worked.  I wish I had a bucket of moral dilemmas, a box of self-revelations and lists of reversals.  I wish I could just grab some of them, line them up in the right order and have an amazing story.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of this desire (and my secret fear that maybe some formulas do work but I just don’t know the right one), I did something most writers who’ve been around the block a few times would not do.  I bought John Truby’s “Great Screenwriting” series of tapes.  (To be fair, I bought it only after reading
        <a href="http://wordplayer.com/columns/wp07.23.Steps.html" target="_blank">
         this ringing endorsement
        </a>
        .)  Not only did I buy it, I listened to the whole damn thing – 14 hours worth.  After that, I wrote… a lot.  To see if the tapes made a difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thought I’d report on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me say, up front, that I really enjoy Mr. Truby’s mesmerizing voice.  Over the several weeks it took me to get through the tapes, I came to look forward to turning on my little old-school cassette player and being drawn into his Zen vortex, making me feel at ease, making me believe that screenwriting is an orderly process, one that can be planned and executed and everything will work out just fine.
       </p>
       <p>
        And let me say, some of his ideas, while not new, are central concepts and are explained very nicely.  For a beginning screenwriter with no training, they are important ideas to be exposed to.  On the other hand, some of his ideas were just…wonky….  But that’s okay.  As I’ve said here before, take what works.  Lose what doesn’t.
       </p>
       <p>
        The real trouble comes with applying the ideas.  (Isn’t that always the case?)  Mr. Truby applied his structural ideas to many films and always showed us why the scripts were flawed.  The only problem is, for most of his examples, the “flaws” were the most interesting aspect of the scripts, at least to me.  For example, he talked about why “
        <a href="http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/unforgiven.html" target="_blank">
         Unforgiven
        </a>
        ” does not work.  To me, it works fine.  Maybe not the best script ever written, but nice solid work.  Another example, “
        <a href="http://www.scifiscripts.com/msol/verdict.txt" target="_blank">
         The Verdict
        </a>
        .”  What’s wrong with “The Verdict’?  Great writing.  I don’t care if the moral self-revelation comes too early.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the first ten or so examples, I came to realize that Mr. Truby and I simply have different tastes.  But what does that say about his method?  To me, it says, “Generalities are just generalities.  Writing is a subtle mixture of skills, judgment, tastes and imagination.  Any analysis is imperfect and no analysis fits all stories.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonetheless, again to be fair, the core of his ideas are very traditional and, for those without any real training, important to be exposed to.  Not to embrace wholeheartedly, but to know and consider.  If you have a writing degree, forget it.  You’ve been there.  If you’ve been writing for ten years, had scripts covered forever, been given notes by producers, you’ve been there.  If not, maybe it’s worth a listen.
       </p>
       <p>
        So did the tapes make a difference in my writing?  Well, yeah, in a sense.  They reminded me to keep my eye on the basics.  Like, make sure the audience can follow your lead’s desire line.   The more rewrites I do, the more I forget the basics.  Even Tiger Woods studies the basics.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, to sum up…
       </p>
       <p>
        No magic secret answers;
        <br/>
        Some important ideas, especially for beginners;
        <br/>
        Some really wonky ideas;
       </p>
       <p>
        And that Zen voice….

        Greg from Hermosa asks:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         When using stories that were told to you – like by a police officer – that involve cases that have already been prosecuted – what is the general rule as to how much of the story you need to change, once the information is already in the public domain.  Is changing a few names and locations enough?  Or does it have to be more drastic than that?
        </p>
        <p>
         And if so, how does Law and Order get away with it?
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         [Caveat:  This is not legal advice, just thoughts on a weblog.]
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        This question is trickier than it sounds.  When portraying real life events, there are two primary questions: (1) How close to the truth must you stay to avoid defamation or other types of lawsuits? and (2) what is the source of your information?
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are telling a real life story, you are ordinarily protected from a defamation action if the story is true.  However, if the story portrays events in the life of a private person (as opposed to a “public figure”), you may be liable for invasion of privacy even if the events you portray are true.  On the other hand, if you are portraying the story of a “public figure”, you are protected from actions for defamation and, for the most part, privacy, as long as you do not exhibit “malice” in the story.  “Malice” is usually defined as an intentional distortion or reckless disregard for the truth with intent to injure the party about whom the story is made.
       </p>
       <p>
        A “public figure” is a person who intentionally injects himself or herself into the limelight, such as an entertainer or politician.  Others can be “public figures” at least for limited purposes.  For example, an accused murderer is a public figure, at least with respect to stories related to the murder.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other important issue relates to the source of the material.  You can freely use “facts” known to the general public because facts do not have copyright protection, only the expression of those facts (e.g. a newspaper article).  However, if you are using stories told to you by a police officer, even if the subject matter of the story is generally known to the public, your information may contain the private impressions and experiences of the officer.  That portion of the material is owned by the police officer and you need to obtain rights to use it.  Similarly, if you are basing your story on newspaper accounts of the event, you must be careful not to include the impressions and experiences of the reporter.  You can only use the “facts.”  The line between facts and impressions and experiences is not always clear.  For that reason, unless the event is widely known, most studios prefer to secure rights to some kind of material, whether it is a newspaper story, a book, or the rights to someone who participated in the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Examples:
       </p>
       <p>
        1.  “The Perfect Storm” – true story of a storm, but much information about the characters was fictionalized.  In that case, the family of one of the dead crewmembers sued in Florida and lost.  HELD:  No defamation, no invasions of privacy, no malice, even if the events as portrayed were not accurate.
       </p>
       <p>
        2.  “Primary Colors” – obvious fictionalized version of Clinton’s rise to power.  No defamation because (i) Clinton is a public figure and the story is “fair comment” and (ii) the story is clearly fictionalized and, while designed to comment on Clinton, it is obviously not intended to be his real story.
       </p>
       <p>
        3.  “Law And Order” – the writers take stories “ripped from the headlines” on a regular basis.  They are protected because (i) “ripped from the headlines” by its nature means “public figure” and (ii) they are clear that the stories are fictionalized and only inspired by true events, not a portrayal of the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        4.  “Nixon” – the true to life story of Richard Nixon.  The writers are protected because Nixon was the most public of public figures, President of The United States.  He would have had to show that the material was untrue and written with the intent of injuring his reputation.
       </p>
       <p>
        While studios are sued all the time when they produce real life stories, if you as a writer follow these basic guidelines, the real life nature of your story should not be a deterrent to selling it.  Hopefully, it is an asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        Good luck with your story.
