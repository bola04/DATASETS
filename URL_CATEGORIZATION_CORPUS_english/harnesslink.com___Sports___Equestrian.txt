          </h2>
          <p>
           WILKES-BARRE PA - A "Who's Who" of the free-for-all pacers, three-year-old trotters, and three-year-old pacers both male and female were gathered together at The Downs at Mohegan Sun Pocono Saturday night, trying to perform well in elimination races and qualify for next Saturday's $2,000,000 Sun Stakes Saturday Championships race card. The expected rain thankfully never came, but there was a frontstretch headwind.
 
 FRANKLIN PACE (FFA p)
 
 Heaven Rocks A proved best in a cavalry charge to the wire, sweeping off cover to reduce his Stateside mark to 1:49.3 in the first of three $30,000 Franklin elims. Check Six moved to the lead after the 26.1 opener, got to the midpoint in 54.1, then was challenged by first-over Western Fame to the 1:22 ¾ pole.
 
 Heaven Rocks A tipped three-wide midturn, was (as has been his norm) a bit hard to keep on a maximum course late on the turn, but then showed determination to withstand late-charging Donttellmeagain by a neck, with Western Fame holding stoutly for third and a Franklin final spot. Ross Croghan trains the winner of $414,145, and driver David Miller co-owns him with the Let It Ride Stables Inc. and Dana Parham.
 
 McWicked made winning look McEasy despite a first-over journey, winning handily for driver Brian Sears in 1:48.3. Mach It So set the early pace of 26 and 54.2, then had to contend with the inexorable McGrind of the winner. McWicked took the lead shortly after the 1:21.2 ¾, then finished out in 27.1, 2Â¾ lengths ahead of Rockin Ron, who split horses late to just get second over longshot Mac's Jackpot, who photoed Mach It So for advancement to next week's Championship.
 
 Casie Coleman conditions the veteran son of McArdle, who now is at $2,394,362 in career earnings, for S S G Stables.
 
 Sintra, sitting third headstretch, ducked far inside for the stretch drive and did get to the wire first in 1:48.4 in his Franklin elim, but he went inside the pylons in doing so and was placed third, elevating All Bets Off, who missed a nose after setting much of the pace (54.2, 1:21), to the big share of the purse.
 
 Filibuster Hanover, sitting in the pocket after taking the early lead (26.1) then yielding and to All Bets Off's immediate left through the lane, was third placed second to halt his undefeated 2018 season, with Sintra's placement back to third still enough to get him through to the Championship.
 
 All Bets Off, who sat a world record here three years ago that still stands, was another successful teaming for Team Kakaley/Burke, nudging his earnings up to $2,990,054 for Burke Racing Stable LLC, Weaver Bruscemi LLC, Frank Baldachino, and the Panhellenic Stable Corporation.
 
 BEAL TROT (3YO Open trot)
 
 Manchego kept her career record perfect after 15 starts, but in taking on "the boys" in her $25,000 Beal Trot elim she was extended further than she had ever been before, holding off a game Crystal Fashion by a nose while equaling her career best of 1:52.4.
 
 Yannick Gingras kept the filly in midpack until traffic settled late on the first turn, then got her in gear before the 26.4 quarter, brushed to the lead, and got relatively soft middle fractions of 56 and 1:24.4. But through the stretch Crystal Fashion, who had ducked inside from second-over an 1/8 of a mile out, gained steadily, with Gingras chasing after the super filly late to maintain the victory and The Streak, in only her third race of the year.
 
 Jimmy Takter trains the winning daughter of Muscle Hill, who now has earnings of $929,688 for the ownership of Black Horse Racing, John Fielding, and Herb Liverman.
 
 Ohio champion Mission Accepted proved he was the real deal against Grand Circuit stock by taking the first of the Beal eliminations in 1:53.2.
 
 Those who had backed the Manofmanymissions colt to 4-5 had a few anxious moments down the back as their choice significantly gapped the cover of Patent Leather, who went his third split in 26.4 to clear pacesetter Whats The Word. But driver Ryan Stahl got more out of Mission Accepted and gained on the turn, then dove down into an open Pocono Pike, trotting away late for a 1¼ length tally over Patent Leather, with Lawmaker, forwardly-placed throughout, taking third.
 
 The winner, perfect in four starts this year and the OhSS Final victor at two, now has a bankroll of $268,300 for trainer Jeff Conger, who is also the co-owner with Knox Services Inc. and David Wills.
 
 Six Pack started from post six in his Beal elim, then recorded all "1"s across his charted line, withstanding a late Pocono Pike rush from Evaluate by ¾ of a length to win in 1:53.3. Trainer-driver Ã…ke Svanstedt put the New York star right on the lead, and after a 29.3 second quarter breather the son of Muscle Mass flew home in 56 - 27.4.
 
  
 
 Evaluate (at .90 odds to Six Pack's .80*), in the pocket, raced strongly in the lane to maintain second, with Fashionwoodchopper showing grit to hold on for third and advancement after having to go first-over. Six Pack now shows earnings of $345,055 for Ã…ke Svanstedt Inc., Little E LLC, and Stall Kalmar FF.
 
 HEMPT PACE (3YO c/g pace)
 
 They saved the best for last on Sun Stakes Saturday elimination night, as the I'm Gorgeous colt Lather Up brought to mind another recent good horse (Wiggle something or other) by making the lead past the Â¼, then coming home in 53.1 in hand late for driver Montrell Teague to freeze the timer in 1:49 in his $25,000 Hempt elimination.
 
 After the 26.2 opener put down by Nutcracker Suite, Lather Up, three-wide just past the 1/8, raced up to grab command, got a huge breather with a 55.4 half, and then asserted his divisional dominance with the brilliant last half, winning by 2Â¼ lengths over Nutcracker Suite, with Wes Delight edging Well Done to move on to the Championship.
 
 But someone will have to go a big mile in seven days time to defeat Lather Up, trained by Clyde Francis and moving his bankroll to $544,765 for owners Gary and Barbara Iles, who saw their pride and joy remain undefeated in seven seasonal starts and add a seasonal record to his ever-growing resume.
 
 Dorsoduro Hanover made a swift move to the lead before the 5/8 in the first of the Hempt elims, then held on gamely over the late charge of Springsteen by a neck, with forwardly-placed This Is The Plan, looped for the lead down the back, coming back to be another neck off the 1:49.4 winner to complete the trio to advance.
 
 The victorious Somebeachsomewhere gelding took a new lifetime mark and set a season's record (so it only lasted 55 minutes ...), running his 2018 record to 4-for-5 this season while taking his earnings to $172,668. Matt Kakaley handled sulky duties for trainer Ron Burke and the partnership of Burke Racing Stables LLC; Silva, Purnel &amp; Libby; Weaver Bruscemi LLC; and the Wingfield Five.
 
 Hitman Hill paid a 26.2 price to get the lead before the quarter, put down 54.4 and 1:22.1 middle splits, then lasted to the wire by a head over inside charger Shnitzledosomethin in 1:49.3, a personal best and a tick better than Dorsoduro Hanover divisional season's record. Stay Hungry, who found all sorts of trouble, out to the quarter before tucking from PP8, then checking when the first-over broke before the ¾, rallied stoutly for third to advance.
 
 Hitman Hill is a son of American Ideal who was guided by Brett Miller for trainer Chris Oakes, and the ownership of Tom Hill and Northfork Racing Stable.
 
 LYNCH PACE (3YO filly pace)
 
 Youaremycandygirl, looking more like her 2017 championship self, took the first $20,000 Lynch elimination on the engine in 1:51.3. Yannick Gingras was out to the 27.1 quarter to make the lead behind the daughter of American Ideal, then tripped the timer at the half in 56.2 before Alexa's Power moved up to challenge.
 
 The 6-5 second choice pacesetter (the first non-favorite to win in the eliminations after five straight chalk) and the 1-2* first-over battled to and past the 1:23.2 3/4s, with Alexa's Power dropping in the pocket at headstretch and second-over Double A Mint coming quickly in the lane. The "Candygirl" (named after a line in a song by the "group" The Archies) held off Double A Mint by a neck, with Alexa's Power and Hypnotic Tale next in line. Ron Burke conditions the winner of $925,915, 2-for-4 this year and 11-for-15 lifetime, for owner W. J. Donovan.
 
 Kissin In The Sand left to the early lead, let Sidewalk Dancer go by at the half, then surged in the Pocono Pike midstretch to catch that rival by a half length in 1:51.1 in the other Lynch elim. Sidewalk Dancer was out the whole way in the 26.4 quarter and almost to the half in 55 before clearing the winning favorite, went to the Â¾ in 1:23.1, but succumbed to the pocket rocket late, with I'm Trigger Happy, Sansovina Hanover, and Serene Stride (the faster 5th-place finisher) going on to the Championship.
 
 Kissin In The Sand was driven by Scott Zeron for trainer Nancy Johansson, and the daughter of Somebeachsomewhere has earnings of $345,545 for owners Marvin Katz and the Hatfield Stables.
 
 GREAT NORTHEAST OPEN SERIES (top older pacers)
 
 Why did he include a $30,000 race, the Great Northeast event, in this wrapup? How about because the winner, Bettor's Edge, equaled the fastest mile of the year on a 5/8-mile track in North America by winning in 1:48.2?
 
 How about because the fractions were 25.1, 53.3, and 1:20, and the nine-year-old winner set most of the pace? Rodeo Romeo got past Bettor's Edge after the astounding quarter, but then the winner of $2,133,382 was out and retaking for Scott Zeron in front of the stands and "got a rest" to the half.
 
 Then Highalator came first-over and got a small advantage late backstretch through the smoking 3/4s, but the winner held him off, then withstood the Pocono Pike late move of Rodeo Romeo to tally by a Â½ length for trainer Jennifer Lappe, also the co-owner with Robert Santagata; Highalator was only a neck further back in third.

            First eight races from Pocono Sun Stakes
           </a>
          </h2>
          <p>
           WILKES-BARRE PA – A “Who’s Who” of the free-for-all pacers, three-year-old trotters, and three-year-old pacers both male and female were gathered together at The Downs at Mohegan Sun Pocono Saturday night, trying to perform well in harness racing elimination races and qualify for next Saturday’s $2,000,000 Sun Stakes Saturday Championships race card. There was a frontstretch headwind.
 
 FRANKLIN PACE (FFA p)
 
 Heaven Rocks A proved best in a cavalry charge to the wire, sweeping off cover to reduce his Stateside mark to 1:49.3 in the first $30,000 Franklin elim. Check Six moved to the lead after the 26.1 opener, got to the midpoint in 54.1, then was challenged by first-over Western Fame to the 1:22 ¾ pole. Heaven Rocks A tipped three-wide midturn, was (as has been his norm) a bit hard to keep on a maximum course late on the turn, but then showed determination to withstand late-charging Donttellmeagain by a neck, with Western Fame holding stoutly for third and a Franklin final spot. Ross Croghan trains the winner of $414,145, and driver David Miller co-owns him with the Let It Ride Stables Inc. and Dana Parham.
 
 McWicked made winning look McEasy despite a first-over journey, winning handily for driver Brian Sears in 1:48.3. Mach It So set the early pace of 26 and 54.2, then had to contend with the inexorable McGrind of the winner. McWicked took the lead shortly after the 1:21.2 ¾, then finished out in 27.1, 2¾ lengths   ahead of Rockin Ron, who split horses late to just get second over longshot Mac’s Jackpot, who photoed Mach It So for advancement to next week’s Championship. Casie Coleman conditions the veteran son of McArdle, who now is at $2,394,362 in career earnings, for S S G Stables.
 
 BEAL TROT (3YO Open trot)
 
 Ohio champion Mission Accepted proved he was the real deal against Grand Circuit stock by taking the first of the $25,000 Beal eliminations in 1:53.2. Those who had backed the Manofmanymissions colt to 4-5 had a few anxious moments down the back as their choice significantly gapped the cover of Patent Leather, who went his third split in 26.4 to clear pacesetter Whats The Word. But driver Ryan Stahl got more out of Mission Accepted and gained on the turn, then dove down into an open Pocono Pike, trotting away late for a 1¼ length tally over Patent Leather, with Lawmaker, forwardly-placed throughout, taking third. The winner, perfect in four starts this year and the OhSS Final victor at two, now has a bankroll of $268,300 for trainer Jeff Conger, who is also the co-owner with  Knox Services Inc. and David Wills.
 
 Six Pack started from post six in his Beal elim, then recorded all “1”s across his charted line, withstanding a late Pocono Pike rush from Evaluate by ¾ of a length to win in 1:53.3. Trainer-driver Åke Svanstedt put the New York star right on the lead, and after a 29.3 second quarter breather the son of Muscle Mass flew home in 56 – 27.4. Evaluate (at .90 odds to Six Pack’s .80*), in the pocket, raced strongly in the lane to maintain second, with Fashionwoodchopper showing grit to hold on for third and advancement after having to go first-over. Six Pack now shows earnings of $345,055 for Åke Svanstedt Inc., Little E LLC, and Stall Kalmar FF.
 
 HEMPT PACE (3YO c/g pace)
 
 Dorsoduro Hanover made a swift move to the lead before the 5/8 in the first of the $25,000 Hempt elims, then held on gamely over the late charge of Springsteen by a neck, with forwardly-placed This Is The Plan, looped for the lead down the back, came back to be another neck off the 1:49.4 winner to complete the trio to advance. The victorious Somebeachsomewhere gelding took a new lifetime mark and set a season’s record, running his 2018 record to 4-for-5 this season while taking his earnings to $172,668. Matt Kakaley handled sulky duties for trainer Ron Burke and the partnership of Burke Racing Stables LLC; Silva, Purnel &amp; Libby; Weaver Bruscemi LLC; and the Wingfield Five.
 
 LYNCH PACE (3YO filly pace)
 
 Youaremycandygirl, looking more like her 2017 championship self, took the first $20,000 Lynch elimination on the engine in 1:51.3. Yannick Gingras was out to the 27.1 quarter to make the lead behind the daughter of American Ideal, then tripped the timer at the half in 56.2 before Alexa’s Power moved up to challenge.
 
 The 6-5 second choice pacesetter (the first non-favorite to win in the eliminations after five straight chalk) and the 1-2* first-over battled to and past the 1:23.2 3/4s, with Alexa’s Power dropping in the pocket at headstretch and second-over Double A Mint coming quickly in the lane. The “Candygirl” (named after a line in a song by the “group” The Archies) held off Double A Mint by a neck, with Alexa’s Power and Hypnotic Tale next in line. Ron Burke conditions the winner of $925,915, 2-for-4 this year and 11-for-15 lifetime, for owner W. J. Donovan.
 
 Kissin In The Sand left to the early lead, let Sidewalk Dancer go by at the half, then surged in the Pocono Pike midstretch to catch that rival in 1:51.1 in the other Lynch elim. Sidewalk Dancer was out the whole way in the 26.4 quarter and almost to the half in 55 before clearing the winning favorite, went to the ¾ in 1:23.1, but succumbed to the pocket rocket late, with I’m Trigger Happy, Sansovina Hanover, and Serene Stride (the faster 5th-place finisher) going on to the Championship. Kissin In The Sand was driven by Scott Zeron for trainer Nancy Johansson, and the daughter of Somebeachsomewhere has earnings of $345,545 for owners Marvin Katz and the Hatfield Stables.
 
 GREAT NORTHEAST OPEN SERIES (top older pacers)
 
 Why did he include a $30,000 race, the Great Northeast event, in this wrapup? How about because the winner, Bettor’s Edge, equaled the fastest mile of the year on a 5/8-mile track in North America by winning in 1:48.2?
 
 How about because the fractions were 25.1, 53.3, and 1:20, and the nine-year-old winner set most of the pace? Rodeo Romeo got past Bettor’s Edge after the astounding quarter, but then the winner of $2,133,382 was out and retaking for Scott Zeron in front of the stands and “got a rest” to the half.
 
 Then Highalator came first-over and got a small advantage late backstretch through the smoking 3/4s, but the winner held him off, then withstood the Pocono Pike late move of Rodeo Romeo to tally by a ½ length for trainer Jennifer Lappe, also the co-owner with Robert Santagata; Highalator was only a neck further back in third.

            Ben Hur Cup set at H3R; wager decided on
           </a>
          </h2>
          <p>
           Trois-Rivieres, QC - The stage is set for the inaugural Ben Hur Cup at the Hippodrome 3R on Sunday and both harness racing drivers in this classic face-off, have agreed to a "gentleman's wager" for the event.
 
 The Ben Hur Cup will pit the champion, Sylvain Filion, against the challenger, Louis-Phillipe Roy in eight tournament races, the 2nd through the 9th on the 10-race program.
 
 The first and tenth races are the second round of the Quebec-Bred Series for four and five-year-old pacers and it was decided that stakes races should not be used for the competition.
 
 After the post position draw on Tuesday, both drivers took turns selecting the horses they wanted to drive. They also had to make their selections insuring that they each had one of the eight post positions for the eight races, which was no easy task.
 
 "First of all," Roy said. "I want to thank my scouting team and everybody that helped me with the draft of horses I will drive. I'm very confident with all the selections we've made. Among the selections, I would say that Loves A Challenge is my best bet while Akoya is my spot play."
 
 “I feel very confident that I will win the tournament,” Filion said. “I like the horses I got. I under rated about difficult it would be to select the horses I am driving. I did not think it would be that hard. But this was the best way to do it, very fair for both of us.”
 
 The point system for the Ben Hur Cup will be as follows:
 
 First place - 8 points
 
 Second place - 7 points
 
 Third place - 6 points
 
 Fourth place - 5 points
 
 Fifth place - 4 points
 
 Sixth place -3 points
 
 Seventh place - 2 points
 
 Eight place - 1 point
 
 Race fans from across the world via Facebook were asked what the "gentleman wager" between these two great drivers should be. The wager agreed upon by Filion and Roy that was suggested by the race fans is that the loser of the competition will have to pull a jog cart up and down in front of the grandstand with the winner aboard holding the Ben Hur Cup.
 
 "I just hope for Sylvain that he has good shoeing," Roy laughed. "I don't want him to make a break while pulling me around in the race bike."
 
 “I have told him (LPR) that I was fine with the wager,” Filion laughed. “But I told him I weigh a little bit more than you and that he might have a hard time carrying me all around. I don’t know if he could make it a whole mile.”
 
 We are sure this will make for some great video and photographs and a lot of laughs and cheers from the race fans.
 
 First race post time is 12:50 pm.
 
 Both Filion and Roy will be in the grandstand at 11:30 am for a special meet and greet autograph session.

            Breakfast with the babies at the Meadowlands
           </a>
          </h2>
          <p>
           East Rutherford, NJ - Saturday, June 23 Breakfast With The Babies (BWTB) at The Meadowlands began at 10am on a fast track under overcast skies with little wind, temperatures unseasonable cool in the mid-sixties. Jules Siegel sponsors BWTB via his Fashion Farms harness racing breeding operation.
 
 
 Tony Alagna brought six sons from the first crop of his champion pacer Captaintreacherous in to race this morning and opened the colt pacing races with a one-two finish in the 11th.
 
 Odds On Boca Raton (Zeron) sat tight behind the pace of then edged by stablemate Shipshape (Brett Miller) in 1:54.4. Shipshape went easily through the 1:27.4 three quarters with Zeron tipping his charge out for the drive and getting by the leader with minimal encouragement.
 
 The winner is owned by Dana Parham's Odds On Racing who paid $105,000 for him at the Lexington sale. Steve Stewart and Conquest Acres are the breeders.
 
 US Captain (Gingras) made the team 2 - 4 - 2 when he edged by a game Bombay Hanover (Zeron) through a 26.4 on the board end to a mile in 1:55. This precocious Captaintreacherous colt is from World Champion American Jewel and brought a winning bid of $180,000 from Myron Bell on behalf of breeder Brittany Farms, Brad Grant, Joe Barbera and US Captain Racing.
 
 Captain Ahab completed the perfect day with a 1:54.4 / 27.2 Gingras with something left. He set all the pace, was left with a big lead when the pocket sitter broke at headstretch then held sway over a late charging Duddie's Lor for the win. Captain Ahab is another Brittany bred with the farm remaining a component of the partnership with Brad Grant, Vinnie Barbera and Captain Ahab Racing that gave $100,000 for him in Lexington.
 
 Trotting fillies opened the card and The Ice Dutchess began her promising career with a 1:56.4 winning effort for trainer/driver Jimmy Takter. Takter put her on the lead from the word go with Personal Paradise (Ake Svanstedt) tracking her every move from the pocket through sociable fractions, when they straightened up he hit the gas pedal and she responded with a 27.3 final quarter.
 
 The Ice Dutchess was a $320,000 Harrisburg buy for Coyote Wind Farms and the Muscle Hill filly was bred by Stephen &amp; David Dey.
 
 Speed Titan won the second race for Brian Sears in a forwardly placed 1:59.1. Taking over on the backstretch on the way to the 1:00 half, Speed Titan sailed home in 27.4 to win by nearly 10 lengths over Taja Mahalla (Brian Connor). The winner is trained by Marcus Melander for Rick T. Wahlstedt who paid $70,000 for the EL Titan filly in Lexington. The breeder is Kjell Magne Andersen.
 
 Trond Smedshammer won the third with the Explosive Matter filly Matterlei in 2:00.4. After leaving to the top, Trond released Ms Masterpiece and followed that rival through a 1:01.1 middle half before tipping Matterlei to the outside off the last turn for the 28.3 sprint home. Mimi'spearloflindy (Tim Tetrick) closed a bit to be second. Purple Haze Stable paid a mere $14,000 for Matterlei at Harrisburg last fall, Shanamphilankilou is the breeder.
 
 Colt trotters came around in the fourth where Gerry converted a perfect Tim Tetrick drive into a 1:58.2 / 27.1 win. The pair tracked Battenberg (David Miller) through easy numbers then jetted by that rival through the fast final quarter well in hand. Lennart Agren as SRF Stable gave $225,000 for the Muscle Hill colt at the Lexington Selected sale, KG Bertmark Hingstdepa is the breeder.
 
 Melander sent out another winner in the Muscle Hill colt Demon On The Hill (Sears). The path to victory was the tried and true go to the front, rate and sprint, with a 28 flat end to the 1:58 record over a very handy Osterc (Yannick Gingras). Vicky Trotting, Inc owns the winner, a $125,000 Harrisburg yearling bred by Walnridge Farm &amp; Meirs.
 
 Galixton won at first asking for Ake Svanstedt in 1:58.2, closing into a 29.4 final quarter to get by Lucius Vorenus (D. Miller). He's from Trixton's first crop and was an $87,000 Lexington yearling buy for Little E, LLC, Hans Enggren and Joe Sbrocco from breeder Brittany Farms. The race was marred by The Chutzpah Kid falling at the half; happily both the "Kid" and driver Brian Connor got up and walked off.
 
 Uncle Peter had a 2:00 winner from his first crop in Super Schissel, another Takter pupil. A pocket ride behind Consus Victory was the route to success, Takter tipped his charge out in the stretch and closed in 28 and change for the score over Captain Krupnik (Svanstedt). The Ohio-bred winner was sold at the Lexington sale for $115,000 to Al Libfeld and Perry Soderberg, consigned by Coyote Wind Farms.
 
 As Time Goes By (Andy Miller) won the first of the pacing races as the Captinatreacherous lass sat a pocket to another Cap'n filly in Cash Reward (Gingras) then sprinted by that rival with a 26.2 end to the 1:56.4 mile. The winner was bought by Willow Oak Ranch and Andy for $120,000 in Lexington from breeders Steve Stewart and Birch Hollow Farms.
 
 Joe Holloway has another top filly prospect in Zero Tolerance, a Heston Blue Chip $30,000 Lexington bargain that won impressively again, this time in 1:54.2 / 26.3 in hand to Dave Miller. She set friendly fractions, fought off a hard rush from Hurrikane Norakane around the final bend then kept Izzy Hanover (Scott Zeron) and Treacherous Reign (Bret Miller) at bay late. Zero Tolerance is a Winbak bred, owned by Val D'Or Farms and Ted Gewertz.
 
 Dave Miller came back to win with Mi Nina Bonita next, cutting the mile and holding off Odds On Clearwater (Zeron) and Michelon's Filly (Marcus Miller) through a 28.1 end to the 1:56.4 mile. Robbie Siegelman trains the $7,000 Harrisburg bargain for himself, Horowitz and Vasquez, Barry Rubenstein Farms bred her.
 
 Several colts with Hambletonian aspirations were in qualifiers today and the enigmatic Tactical Landing made a large stride in that direction for Jimmy Takter with a 1:53.1 win over another legitimate prospect in Met's Hall (Andy Miller). Celebrity Express (Dewayne Minor) went along quickly on the lead and it was mid-stretch before the pair of sophomore colts reached him, trotting official 27 final quarters to get by that rival with Tactical Landing holding off Met's Hall close by just over a length while in hand.
 
 Tae Kwon Deo made his first start state-side for Takter a winning one with an easy 1:57 effort. He comes with strong credentials from Lufti Kolgjini's stable in Sweden and was the winner of the Swedish Breeders Crown. The Muscle Hill colt was sent to Takter with the Hambletonian targeted.
 
 Complete results may be viewed on the web.
 
 Live racing resumes at The Meadowlands tonight at 7:15 pm with The Summer Wine Festival on the bill with 11 races.

           EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - It has been a long time between drinks for harness racing's 2015 Hambletonian champion Pinkman, but his extended wait to return to the winner's circle is finally over.
 
 The Jimmy Takter trainee, who last won on May 29, 2016 in a stakes event in Sweden, took the featured conditioned trot Friday night at the Meadowlands in 1:52 by a half-length over Misslarose. Opulent Yankee finished third.
 
 Prior to his score in Sweden, Pinkman's previous North American victory came in the October 10, 2015 Kentucky Futurity, two months after he hoisted Hambletonian hardware.
 
 Friday night, driver Andy McCarthy was in the sulky as Pinkman, who never saw the rail, was in a live second-over flow heading for three-quarters. He tipped off his cover in midstretch and rolled to his 19th career win in 42 starts for owners C. Takter, John and Jim Fielding, J. McClelland and H. Liverman. Lifetime, the 6-year-old gelded son of Explosive Matter has earned $2.65 million.
 
 As the 3-1 second choice in the wagering, Pinkman returned $8.00 to win. Lindy The Great, the 3-2 public choice, broke stride before the quarter.
 
 HAMBO HOPEFULS: The Paula Wellwood-trained Southwind Chrome crushed an overmatched field in a non-winners of two earlier on the card. The Hambletonian eligible, a son of Chapter Seven, was driven by Scott Zeron and completed the mile in 1:54 as the 1-5 favorite for his first-ever win in his fifth start.
 
 Zephyr Kronos, trained and driven by Takter, won a non-winners of three later in the evening. The son of Ready Cash, another Hambo eligible, scored on the front end in 1:53 as the 5-1 third choice in the wagering.
 
 A LITTLE MORE: The Late 20-Cent Jackpot Super High-Five failed to result in a single-ticket winner, upping the carryover to $262,148. ... One lucky player walked away with $11,470 after being the only bettor to survive eight legs in the 20-Cent Survivor Pick-9. ... All-source wagering on the nine-race card totaled $1,767,338. ... Racing resumes at the Big M Saturday at 7:15 p.m.

           Paulick Report on lost positive test result
          </a>
         </div>
         <div class="item-snippet">
          <p>
           The following story appeared today on the Paulickreport.com by Joe Gorajec.
 
 This is a story of a positive test for a Class 1 drug that was lost for eight months, then ignored for a year, only to resurface now.
 
 Here's the short version.
 
 On September 11, 2016, a field of eight Standardbreds competed in the $252,000 Pennsylvania Sire Stakes Championship at Harrah's Philadelphia in Chester, Pa.
 
 Ten days later, the Pennsylvania Equine Toxicology and Research Laboratory (PETRL), the official racing laboratory, issued a report to Pennsylvania Horse Racing Commission (PHRC) headquarters in Harrisburg with a finding of oxycodone in the blood and urine of a horse that won part of the purse money.
 
 What happens next is – nothing.
 
 At least nothing happened for the next eight months. From September 21, 2016, until approximately May 31, 2017, this information remained in limbo. Not even the judges at the track were aware of the lab report.
 
 After May 31, 2017, the matter was ignored.
 
 Below is a statement from Brett Revington, director, Pennsylvania Bureau of Standardbred Horse Racing. It's dated June 19, 2018, and was sent to me via email in response to several questions I asked for an article that I was writing on this matter. It is important to note that this statement is the first public acknowledgment of the positive test:
 
 I can confirm that the 9th race of September 11, 2016 was the PA Sire Stakes Championship. On May 31, 2017, I became aware that there was a test result by PETRL on a particular sample for the 9th race of September 11, 2016 that had not been called.  At the time, the Commission and the Bureau were in a state of transition in a few key personnel areas and unfortunately, this test result was not timely addressed. When we discovered the PETRL test result approximately nine months later, we concluded, in consultation with our legal department, that due to the unusual length of time between the race date and our discovery date, we decided that we could not properly proceed with the matter against the individual trainer or owner. The matter has been closed since June of 2017. No penalties were imposed as a result of human error. In light of this circumstance, new procedures we're (sic) put in place to prevent another such occurrence.
 
 There are three non-negotiable characteristics that are expected of racing's regulators: Be fair, be consistent, and be transparent. Fail in any of these areas, and you lose the trust and respect of the public. Or in this case specifically, the horsemen.
 
 Fairness and Consistency
 The positive finding from the lab on the Sire Stakes horse did not occur in a vacuum.
 
 In the latter half of 2016, the PHRC and the drug oxycodone were not strangers. The PHRC prosecuted four laboratory findings of oxycodone between July 2016 and December 2016.
 
 Here is a synopsis of relevant laboratory findings in the above-mentioned time period.
 
 
 
 In all four cases that penalties were assessed, the judges were notified within days of the lab report's being issued. Their first step was to promptly notify the horse's trainer. Each trainer received a year suspension and a $5,000 fine and the purses were ordered to be forfeited and redistributed. Each trainer appealed. The penalties were reduced due to mitigating factors. The suspensions and fines were rescinded but the purses remained forfeited.
 
 The oxycodone finding in the Sire Stakes Championship was the only outlier. No notice. No hearing. No appeal. No forfeiture of purse.
 
 Owners and trainers in the $252,000 stakes race were denied money that was retained by the connections of a horse testing positive for oxycodone.
 
 Is that fair and consistent?
 
 Transparency
 Even after eight months in limbo the judges were ready to proceed with the standard protocol. But as soon as the lab finding came to their attention in late May 2017 they got word to back off. Don Harmon was the Presiding Judge at the Chester track. The judges were told by Mr. Revington not to pursue this matter. Mr. Revington had become Mr. Harmon's supervisor when Mr. Revington was hired in November 2017 as the director of the Bureau of Standardbred Horse Racing.
 
 How unusual was Mr. Remington's directive?
 
 Mr. Harmon said, “There has never been a time in my 25 years of judging that I received a report for a positive test that I didn't follow up on it. Until this time.”
 
 Mr. Harmon met with Mr. Revington twice in person to voice his concerns. According to Mr. Harmon's calendar, the first meeting took place on June 4, 2017, at the Oxford Diner in Oxford, Pa. This meeting was held at Mr. Harmon's request. His main purpose at the meeting was to discuss the lack of action on the laboratory findings in the 2016 Sire Stakes Championship.
 
 “I told him we can't do that, I don't want to be any part of that. I said it's wrong. I said it's a positive test. I have the paperwork and we have to treat this like any other positive test.”
 
 According to Mr. Harmon, Mr. Revington could not be persuaded. This case was not going to be pursued.
 
 Undeterred, Mr. Harmon met again with Mr. Revington later in the summer at the track in Chester to plead his case.
 
 “We had another discussion about it. I told him I can't be any part of it. Something needs to be done. These things are going to come out and somebody is going to get in trouble for this.”
 
 Mr. Harmon added, “He just told me that nobody would ever find out, and nobody would ever do anything with it.”
 
 The Chester meet ended on December 17, 2017. The following day, Mr. Revington informed Mr. Harmon that his employment with the Pennsylvania Horse Racing Commission was being terminated. Mr. Harmon had served as a judge in Chester for 10 years. The only reason given was that they wanted to move in a different direction.

           Top trainer Ryan Hryhorec is certain to win his fifth South Australian trainer’s premiership but still has goals to achieve before season’s end.
 
 Hryhorec has 75 winners in the state this season and would like to better his career-best of 88 set in the 2015/16 season but he also would love to reach 100 winners in a season.
 
 “I came close in that 2015/16,” Hryhorec said.
 
 “Apart from the 88 locally, I also had 11 interstate for 99 and had Star Brutus in at the last meeting at Globe Derby Park.
 
 “He looked a good winning chance, but a race incident saw me lock wheels and he didn’t win so 100 would be a great achievement.”
 
 With five interstate wins so far this season, Hryhorec is on 80 nationally and knows that another 20 winners in just over two months is a tough ask.
 
 “I have to train roughly three a week for the rest of the season. I have 30 horses in work, but it is going to be hard.”
 
 Hryhorec believes he has three strong chances at Globe Derby Park on Saturday night.
 
 Live For Peace and The Damage Done look excellent hopes in the two heats of the Wunderland Cup while the squaregaiter Gin also looks a winning chance.
 
 Live For Peace comes from gate eight in the Hann’s Horse Transport Winter Wunderland Cup, heat one (1800m) while The Damage Done will start from barrier five in the Pronto United Finance Winter Wunderland Cup, heat two (1800m).
 
 Gin will start from a 10 metre handicap in the DPR Insurance Brokers Trotters Handicap (2230m).
 
 “Live For Peace will be fitter for his win last week at Globe Derby Park,” Hryhorec said.
 
 “He had a slight setback before the run so will be fitter this week and even better for the final.
 
 “I will look to come off the inside row draw early and hopefully he will be good enough to come around and win.
 
 “The Damage Done put up a tough performance at Strathalbyn at his last start and with luck in running should be hard to beat on Saturday.
 
 “Gin looks well placed. She raced roughly at her last two runs at Strathalbyn, but I won well on her at Globe Derby Park previously and provided she trots should be hard to beat.”
 
 Hryhorec also sits second on the SA Drivers’ premiership with 131 winners and would love to reach 150 by season’s end.
 
 On Sunday at Port Pirie, Hryhorec has Supernova Silvia and Darkndapper engaged in the Drivers Invitation series and believes they are drawn to prove excellent chances.
 
 “Supernova Silvia looks a great hope but while he has drawn well Darkndapper is meeting tougher opposition than his recent wins.”

          Mike Deters rebounds from bout with cancer

        <div class="feature2-snippet">

          The heart of a horse is approximately eight pounds. The heart of a racehorse can nearly double or triple that with a range of 18 to 22 pounds. A Standardbred harness racing horse trots at just about or over 30 miles an hour. They can pace at about 35 to 40 miles an hour. Every bit of the horse is being used to break barriers of distance over less times.
 
 The muscles of the legs are a driven power that pull the horse forward with every thump to the ground. The ears, the eyes, the nose guiding the horse towards the direction of the finish line. The mouth controlled by driver on board to steer to victory.
 
 Air is circulated through the nostrils and into the respiratory system, into the lungs. The lungs have a capacity of about 55 liters, which is the equivalent of approximately three water buckets. People naturally have a lung capacity of about 6 liters. These differences are what make a racehorse unique and powerful.
 
 Horses have nearly the same anatomical and physiological make-up; yet, one horse paces wire-to-wire in 49.1 while the horse in the same race finishes up the track in over two minutes.
 
 The great natural set apart is the heart. Not just the anatomy or conditioning of the heart, but the heart of the horse that drives its behavior – their inner motivation.
 
 Horsemen recognize the power and potential of their horses. They can give a biography and stats book for each horse in their barn. There are, too, people who have this power and potential. Strength and resilience that may seem to go unnoticed. However, the success in the end is not, in fact, unnoticed. Horsemen harness this power to share their success and share their hard work by just sending a horse to the track.
 
 Thus, this story is about one of those people who possesses that strength and resilience and his name is Mike Deters.
 
 “I can go on and on about what a good person and great horseman Mike is. His stats tell it all!” owner, breeder and driver Laurie Poulin said.
 
 Mike Deters was born in Ohio and raised in Florida, when his family moved to race at Pompano Park in 1966. In 1975, he moved again to Michigan where he attended high school and college. Ten years later in 1985, Mike moved back down to Florida, where he considers home to be.
 
 He was born and raised in the horse business. His father, Bill, was a driver-trainer.
 
 “I have known Mike Deters since I was seven years old,” trainer Jake Huff said. “His father did blacksmith work in my father’s stable. They moved to my town. His father became a trainer at our stable and I have been around Mike for most of my life. He is a good worker and a good friend with high principles.”
 
 When his dad died in 1985 from cancer, Mike went into the business full time.
 
 Deters has been training his own stable since 1985. He has been a driver, trainer, and owner from the beginning. He was involved in the FSBOA for approximately 15 years, being president of the association for around five to six years.
 
 Mike used to drive, but decided he was a much better trainer than driver. Today, he drives occasionally with the “problem children” as he puts it.
 
 When asked who he looked up to in the harness business, Deters describes his father. “My dad was a great horseman. He could do it all – drive, train, and was one of the best blacksmiths I have ever seen.
 
 “He thought to be nice to people and instilled in me a great work ethic. He said, ‘if you are not afraid to work, you will never go hungry’”.
 
 Deters says his mother, Marilyn, has been a tremendous supporter of his forever. His wife, Shelly, has been his backbone forever. His son, Michael, has been a huge help both in and out of the horse game. He also has two sisters, Melanie and Liz. Melanie is married to trainer-driver Peter Wrenn and Liz lives in North Carolina and is outside of the racing business, living the “normal life”.
 
 Recently, Mike had been diagnosed with cancer. “I went through a pretty brutal bout of stage 4 cancer in the head and neck. I went through eight chemo treatments and 33 radiation sessions and have a clean bill of health now,” Deters said.
 
 The sport of harness racing is much more than just that. It is comparable to life. It is the lives of many, if not all, horsemen. As with the races, there are ups and downs in life. One week a stable can hit the board with every horse and the next, not make a dime. It is the long run that counts. The long hours in the barn – early in the morning, first one to show and late at night, last one to leave.
 
 Being a part of this business means inviting the horses and the owners into your family. It isn’t just about winning, it is about the relationships you form – with horses and with other horsemen.
 
 “I would like to thank my wife, son, family, and all my owners for sticking with me through treatment and hope for continued success. I would also like to thank a couple people for helping along the way. John Spindler, my mentor and a father-like figure to me growing up after my dad died. I couldn’t have done it without him. And Joe Kunkel and his daughter, Betty, who I am still partners with. They both helped my wife and I tremendously along the way.” – Mike Deters
 
 Mike would also like to pay tribute to his late father-in-law, Tom Sells.
 
 Mike has had a partnership with Laurie Poulin for about eleven years. “The first few years were pretty lean, but she has upgraded her broodmare band and the last few years have been very successful,” said Mike.  “Laurie manages a breeding farm and I just try to make the babies she has go, hopefully fast.”
 
 “Mike and I have a great partnership and our families are very close. We both have been around a long time and we understand about having the good and the bad,” said Poulin. “We agree on just about everything, the only difference we have is that I want to keep them ALL,” she laughed.
 
 The two have known each other for about twenty years or more. They met through Terry Kerr, still a great friend to both Laurie and Mike to this day. Mike started driving a mare, Lobro Zepher, for Laurie in the open mares whenever Terry had his horse in the same race.
 
 Later, Mike started turning horses out at Laurie’s farm. At the time, Poulin was breeding a few mares and had some foals that would need to be broke in the near future. So, the two started to barter and that is how “things started to roll” as Laurie put it.
 
 “Joe Pennacchio gave me Arapa Victory to start my breeding operation on one condition,” Laurie recalled. “That I would give his favorite horse, Fox Valley Trump, who Mike drove and gave him his lifetime mark, would have a forever home with me.”
 
 “Prairie Big John started our partnership about eleven years ago. We have had a few that didn’t make it but we have had a lot that did and it have been quite a ride!” Laurie said. “Mike is as honest as it gets and cares so much for the well-being of the horses in his care. Believe me, he’ll tell you in a minute if one is not fast enough and not going to make it.”
 
 Working in the harness racing business and working with horses, horsemen begin to form relationships with those horses. People begin to understand the horse’s attitude and quirks, how to handle the horse, or their favorite treat. They accommodate the horse and in the long run, benefit themselves and their stable.
 
 This form of time-driven observation happens everywhere. Humans are observational animals that make decisions and judgments based on their current observations connected to past experiences. Yet, the only difference here is that this relationship created is made with a different species with no form of solid communication whatsoever.
 
 Still, horsemen acquire this ability to read their horse throughout their ownership. They can assign personalities and emotional qualities to each horse. Ultimately, all of these abilities and observations leads to the picking of a favorite.
 
 Of course, all horsemen can love and treat their animals equally. However, there is always one, or perhaps more than one, particular horse that stands out among the rest in a ranking of favorites.
 
 There are many reasons for choosing this particular horse. Maybe it was a world champion or maybe it was a calm horse with a sensible attitude. Maybe the personality of the horse matched or maybe there was a great length of time of ownership. No matter what – there is always at least one, especially if time working in the business is a great length of time.
 
 Mike Deters was readily able to list seven of his favorite horses: Prairie Fortune, Prairie Sweetheart, Prairie Jaguar, Motor City Madman, Jersey Gigilo, Summer Class, and Nononsenseyankee.
 
 According to Deters, Summer Class was Mike’s first really good horse that he has ever had. Nononsenseyankee was very fast, Mike’s first 1:50 horse, and bought his wife a new kitchen. Prairie Jaguar was Mike’s first 1:49 horse.
 
 Mike says his best horse he has ever had was Prairie Sweetheart. “She was a natural, a freak. Her motor was unbelievable,” he said. “Also, Prairie Fortune. He was as honest as the day is long and shows up every week.”
 
 While Deters has owned these and many other fast and powerful racehorses, he says his greatest accomplishment is finding his wife, Shelly, and having a son, Michael. “They are my biggest supporters. Shelly is my rock. She keeps me grounded and my head on straight.”
 
 His greatest harness racing related accomplishment is being able to make a living, according to Mike. It is developing young horses and having success.
 
 Besides following his lifetime passion of harness racing, Mike says he likes to golf and to bowl. “I am not very good at either, but I really enjoy both,” said Mike.
 
 Laurie Poulin recalls three specific moments to be her best moments with the Deters Stable. The first is getting her picture taken eleven times in a row with Prairie Sweetheart.
 
 The second, having their first undefeated two-year-old, Owosso Flash, that was undefeated at two and three with Mike doing all the driving. He was big brother to Prairie Sweetheart.
 
 “I cannot forget my gentle giant, Prairie Jaguar,” Laurie said. The third best moment so far in their journey and partnership is this horse having the record at Pompano for the most wins of 1:50 or better in a row. “I think it was five!”
 
 He is currently training around 30 head at Tioga Downs this summer.
 
 “When I was asked to write something down about Mike Deters, I came up with a lot to say, but I will be brief. He is a very good man to work for. He works alongside of us all. He gives 110% all the time. He would make a good role model to all,” Debbie Gagnon, a dedicated groom for Deters Stable, said.
 
 Mike Deters is a true horseman for life. He was raised into the business and has worked his way to the top. He has the heart and strength of a racehorse as he has fought off cancer, is now is remission and still goes to the stable every morning.

          Breeders welcome NZB entry into Standardbred market
         </a>
        </div>
        <div class="feature2-snippet">
         <p>
          The New Zealand Standardbred Breeders Association welcomes the arrival of New Zealand Bloodstock into the harness racing community.
 
  
 
 You read that right.
 
  
 
 Last Thursday the New Zealand harness racing industry was delivered the news that New Zealand’s leading bloodstock company was entering the Standardbred market.
 
  
 
 The feedback since has been overwhelmingly positive. Breeders, vendors, purchasers and horsemen and horsewomen have all been quick to rejoice.
 
  
 
 This comes as no surprise given in recent years, many breeders had voiced concerns surrounding the direction and future of the only platform they had to sell young bloodstock in New Zealand.
 
  
 
 Marketing of the sales, health &amp; safety concerns, along with a declining buyer bench were some of the pertinent issues at hand for vendors.
 
  
 
 The future is now a lot clearer, and that future looks to be with NZB Standardbred.
 
  
 
 “We have plans to take this to a whole new level – it won’t just be business as usual,” said New Zealand Bloodstock’s Managing Director Andrew Seabrook this week.
 
  
 
 “Sir Peter Vela (one of two brothers who established New Zealand Bloodstock in the mid-90s headquartered at the world-class Karaka Sales Centre) is really excited by the challenge and the opportunity to grow the company.”
 
  
 
 With access to a range of proven bloodstock, finance, airfreight and insurance services, and increased promotion to domestic and international markets, the harness racing community is assured of a company working in their best interests on several fronts.
 
  
 
 Seabrook says NZB prides itself on its lease-to-own scheme and its in-house finance division.
 
  
 
 “All I know is our business got a huge shot in the arm in 1997 when, after being purchased by the Vela brothers, we opened up a credit arm and started financing both short and long-term.
 
  
 
 “We see it as a pretty significant part of our thoroughbred business, giving people an opportunity to secure their future breeding stock, and it has been a very successful endeavor for us.
 
  
 
 “For young trainers, especially, this will significantly change their approach to the sales,” commented Seabrook.
 
  
 
 “After the 2017 Sales, breeders asked the NZBSA to advocate for changes with PGW,” said NZSBA Chairman John Mooney.
 
  
 
 “The primary concerns were around the lack of marketing and the diminishing small buyers bench. We are confident that the NZB ‘machine’ will address these issues aggressively.
 
  
 
 “They are a company whose sole focus is selling horses. Andrew Seabrook and his team have made it clear to ‘The Breeders’ that they will leave no stone unturned when supporting vendors.”
 
  
 
 New Zealand Bloodstock has an illustrious track record of success as the source of New Zealand champions to the global thoroughbred market.
 
  
 
 The New Zealand Standardbred is a world class equine athlete capable of dominating on the world stage.
 
  
 
 The Australians know it, so too the North American industry.
 
  
 
 NZB’s Andrew Seabrook is also aware of the dominance of the New Zealand Standardbred.
 
  
 
 “Obviously, the thoroughbred breeding industry is much more aligned to international markets and the yearling sales rely heavily upon those buyers.
 
  
 
 “But when one market dries up you have to try and develop other markets and we have people employed to do that.
 
  
 
 “I think the New Zealand Standardbred has probably been more successful than the thoroughbreds in Australia in recent times and that’s something which should be promoted.
 
  
 
 “The American market especially, looks to have been neglected in recent years.
 
  
 
 “But with some good New Zealand-bred horses up there like Lazarus, we plan on making a splash in that market, too.
 
  
 
 “We are quite excited about the future of this and are not going in to this lightly.”
 
  
 
 Highlights
  
 
 Yearling Sales:
 
 Yearlings will sell in their traditional February timeslot at both the Karaka and Christchurch venues. The entry fee will slightly increase by $50 (+GST) at each venue, however entries will be invoiced in January and deducted from the yearling sale proceeds.
 
  
 
 There is a confirmed commitment to holding a Christchurch Sale. 
 
  
 
 Payments to vendors will be received within 30 days of sale.
 
  
 
 Yearling, Weanling &amp; All Age Sale: 
 
 A big change to the current market will be the ability to sell yearlings at the Christchurch Yearling, Weanling &amp; All Age Sale in late April – with all yearling stock going through each ring to be Sales Series eligible.
 
  
 
 Breeders have been wanting this concept for years, and it can only be positive. Yearlings that need time or may suffer an injury close to February now have another opportunity to be sold for their vendors.
 
  
 
 Two-Year-Old Sale: 
 
 September 2019 will see a return of the Ready-to-Run format. This could potentially open a speculative buying market at both the Yearling and Weanling Sales.
 
 Particularly with NZB’s finance facilities such as pin hook funding.
 
  
 
 Horsemen and horsewomen, and breeders have another platform to chance their arm on stock purchased or retained with a view to get them up and going for a sale at the 2YO Sale.
 
  
 
 Finance Facilities: 
 
 Through NZB’s own finance arm, pin hook funding and lease to purchase facilities on fillies and mares, purchasers will find life much easier to secure bloodstock at the Sales.
 
  
 
 Marketing:
 
 The NZB marketing machine have already hit the ground running with digital media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram already in use with the
 
 Standardbred handle.

          Hall plans to lead with One Off Delight
         </a>
        </div>
        <div class="feature2-snippet">
         <p>
          Catch me if you can will be champion reinsman Gary Hall Junior’s mantra when he plans to take full advantage of the prized No. 1 barrier with One Off Delight in the $100,000 Westbred Classic for three-year-old colts and geldings at Gloucester Park on Friday night.
 
 “The last time he led was four starts ago at Gloucester Park when he won pretty convincingly,” said Hall. “So, setting the pace will be my intention on Friday night.”
 
 One Off Delight warmed up for this week’s assignment with a sound third behind Major Pocket and Slick Artist last Tuesday fortnight when he finished solidly after enjoying the one-out, one-back trail.
 
 One Off Delight is the first foal out of New Zealand-bred mare Tiger Su, who won once from 11 starts in New Zealand and three times from nine starts in WA in 2012. Tiger Su’s dam Tigerish was an outstanding juvenile performer in New Zealand and retired with earnings of $491,957 from 15 wins and 21 placings from 79 starts.
 
 The main dangers to One Off Delight appear to be Thisbeachrighthere and Murphys Bettor.
 
 Thisbeachrighthere (barrier five) was a winner at Ballarat and Melton as a two-year-old and he has impressed with three wins and a third placing from five starts in WA for owner-trainers Greg and Skye Bond.
 
 Thisbeachrighthere was untroubled to set the pace from barrier two and win by 8m from Arma Rich Girl over 2185m at Pinjarra three Mondays ago when he dashed over the final quarters in 27.9sec. and 28.1sec.
 
 Murphys Bettor, an inexperienced gelding with two wins from eight starts, will begin from barrier four with Chris Voak in the sulky. He resumed after an absence of four months when he made most of the running and won easily from Kamendable Joe over 2190m at Northam on May 29.
 
 “Murphys Bettor has had a bit of an interrupted campaign, but is certainly capable of winning,” said Voak. “He is one of those horses who does just what he needs to do. He’s a casual, cool dude.”
 
 Murphys Bettor is prepared by Ross Olivieri, who has trained 98 winners this season and has several good each-way prospects among his ten runners on Friday night.
 
 Highroller Joe, trained in Busselton by Jamie Howlett, has shown promise with three wins from nine starts and has each-way prospects from the inside of the back line. He impressed when he scored an easy win in a 2185m trial at Pinjarra on Sunday morning, with final quarters in 27.1sec. and 27.8sec.

          New Zealand’s most successful ever horseman is finally over one of the worst injuries of his career.
 
 But don’t expect to see champion driver Tony Herlihy back at Alexandra Park tomorrow night or any time in the next month.
 
 Herlihy resumed driving fast work at his South Auckland training established this week, over five weeks after a race smash at Alexandra Park left him with ribs broken in a particularly nasty place.
 
 That ruled Herlihy — who has won more races than any other New Zealand-based driver or jockey —out of the Harness Jewels and a spectator at his own stables for much of the first month.
 
 “It took a while to get over, longer than last time I had a similar injury, but it is good to be back driving fast work,” he said.
 
 “But I am not going to rush back into race driving. I am going on holiday in a few weeks and I rather give the injured ribs that extra time to recover.
 
 “So I probably won’t be back driving on racenight for another three or even four weeks.”
 
 That will see his stable’s young reinsmen Tony Cameron and junior Luke Whittaker do the majority of his driving at what is admittedly a quieter time of the season.
 
 But Herlihy still has some major winter goals with juvenile trotter Tickle Me Pink, who is being set for an Australian campaign.
 
 The previously unbeaten filly broke for no apparent reason at the start of her Jewels final but is heading to Victoria in early August.
 
 “We are still keen to take her to the Breeders Crown, especially as there is a separate juvenile filly trotting section which she is eligible for.
 
 “So she might also go to the Redwood at Maryborough before that and could even contest her Breeders Crown heat over there in Victoria depending on how the timing works out.”
 
  Herlihy’s stable star Temporale has also rejoined the stable after a huge season which saw him win the National Trot and finish second in two of Australia’s biggest races.
 
 That form plateaued toward the end of the season but Temporale raced like a horse still growing into his big frame and could be even better next season.
 
 “He looks like he has put a bit of muscle on and all going well we will give him a shot at Cup week in Christchurch this time in.”

          Lather Up's connections reflect on NA Cup
         </a>
        </div>
        <div class="feature2-snippet">
         <p>
          When owner Gary Iles reflects on Lather Up's win in last week's Pepsi North America Cup at Woodbine Mohawk Park, he cannot help but feel blessed. Iles and his wife Barbara watched their homebred colt  overcome a number of obstacles and horses to reach the top of the 3-year-old pacing ranks with his win in the C$1 million race.
 
 "There is one horse a year that gets to do this," Iles said. "I'm 79 years old; I thought I was running out of time. Thank God it worked out and I had my opportunity and we succeeded. I'm humbled by it. I'm humbled by the whole thing. We're very fortunate.
 
 "There were 79 horses nominated (to the North America Cup) and 29 started and to think that out of that you end up being the best of the best. It's a wonderful situation. You have to be blessed."
 
 Montrell Teague drove Lather Up, the 3-5 favorite, to victory for trainer Clyde Francis and the George Teague Jr. training stable. Montrell Teague and Francis finished second with Wiggle It Jiggleit, the 2-5 favorite, in the 2015 North America Cup.
 
 "It made me want it more since I lost it with Wiggles," the 27-year-old Teague said. "It's a million-dollar race, the first million-dollar race I ever won, so to be added to that list and add that to my accomplishments, it feels great."
 
 Added Francis, "We went up there with Wiggles and were the best going into the race, but anything can happen. It's horseracing. Going to the final (with Lather Up) I really thought we had a good shot at it. But I wasn't going to say anything before, just keep it to myself. When it was over, it was a great feeling."
 
 Iles, Teague and Francis all were happy with Lather Up's trip in the North America Cup, which saw him get to the front in a :26.3 opening quarter, yield the top spot briefly to Done Well, and retake the lead prior to reaching the half-mile point in :54.1. From there, Lather Up led to three-quarters in 1:21.3 before winning by 3-1/4 lengths in 1:48.1.
 
 "I got the trip that I didn't expect to get, but the trip that I wanted," Teague said.
 
 "I was happy when (Done Well) came and Montrell retook and no one else came," Iles said. "I thought we had a shot at it then because I know (Lather Up) has that good speed coming home. That's the way it worked out. I'm just amazed he has that kick at the end. But you don't take it for granted until he crosses that wire because a lot can happen."
 
 Said Francis, "When he moved him back to the front I thought he was in a good spot there because they were going to have to come after him. (At the top of the stretch) I was still pretty confident; Montrell hadn't urged him. When he popped the plugs, it was over. They weren't getting to him. Every start he raced, when they came off the turn and hit the lane he was ready to roll. Everything worked out well."
 
 All that remained was a trip to the winner's circle, where the Iles were joined by family and friends.
 
 "There were all those (camera) shutters going off and everyone saying, 'Look here, look here, look here.' It was quite amazing," Iles said. "It was a wonderful feeling. I was really thankful for the support we had.
 
 "More than that, the horse is down in history. That's something quite exciting."
 
 Lather Up will look to remain undefeated in 2018 Saturday when he competes in the third of three Max C. Hempt Memorial eliminations for 3-year-old male pacers at The Downs at Mohegan Sun Pocono. Lather Up, who is 6-for-6 this season, is the 2-1 morning-line favorite in his elim, which also includes North America Cup runner-up Done Well.
 
 The top three finishers from each elimination advance to the $500,000 Hempt final on June 30 at Pocono. Saturday's card  also features eliminations for the Ben Franklin Pace for older male pacers, Earl Beal Jr. Memorial for 3-year-old trotters and James M. Lynch Memorial for 3-year-old female pacers.
 
 "It's a tough field, a very tough field," Iles said about the Hempt. "I'm happy to be there. When you're doing this shipping, a lot of horses come down with some kind of sickness. Fortunately, it hasn't hit us. Hopefully, it doesn't hit anybody. But it's always a concern."
 
 "I think he will be all right," Francis said. "He's in with a bunch of the same horses he raced (last) Saturday night. He trained good today and came out of it well. We're just hoping for the best."
 
 Following the win in the North America Cup, Lather Up moved up to No. 2 in the sport's weekly rankings, trailing only 6-year-old female trotter Hannelore Hanover, the defending Horse of the Year in the U.S. and Canada. Lather Up was the only 3-year-old male pacer among the top 14 horses in the poll.
 
 "It's still early," Teague said. "Mine looks the most exciting so far, but any of them can step up at any time. That was the first big race, but there are plenty more. You never know who is going to step up.
 
 "But so far it's definitely fun. He's looking like the good horse we thought he was going to be. Even more."

          Peter Wrenn scores 10,000th career win

         <p>
          ANDERSON, IN.- Driver Peter Wrenn joined elite company as he became the 14th driver in harness racing history to reach 10,000 career driving wins at Hoosier Park Racing &amp; Casino on Tuesday, June 19. A winner of more than $72 million in lifetime purse earnings, Wrenn joins harness racing greats Herve Filion, Cat Manzi, Dave Palone, Tony Morgan, Walter Case Jr., and Dave Magee in the elusive 10,000 win club.
 
 Wrenn needed three wins coming into Tuesday's card and with five scheduled mounts, he found the winner's circle three times to reach the milestone. Wrenn collected win 9,998 with Skyway Jewel in race three and win 9,999 in the very next race behind Mr Gorgeous for trainer Larry King. Win number 10,000 came as Wrenn steered Blue Power to a gate to wire maiden breaking victory for trainer Ron Otto.
 
 Hoosier Park's Vice President and General Manager, Rick Moore, along with Wrenn's family and friends, were in the winner's circle to congratulate and acknowledge his accomplishment.
 
 "What an accomplishment," Moore noted. "On behalf of Hoosier Park Racing &amp; Casino and Centaur Gaming, I would like to congratulate Peter on this monumental milestone. He now joins elite harness racing company and we are honored to have Peter as part of the driving colony at Hoosier Park."
 
 The Michigan native recorded his first win in 1978 and by the mid-1990s was winning driving titles all over the country. Wrenn has competed in nearly every major race to date and included in his impressive array of major stakes wins are two prestigious Breeders Crown wins and a victory in the Jugette with Paige Nicole Q. Wrenn won a career-high 634 races in 2007 and has surpassed the $2 million mark in purse earnings seven out of the last ten seasons.
 
 "First and foremost, I would like to thank all the owners and trainers that have given me the opportunity to drive so many great horses over the years," Wrenn noted after the victory. "I've been very fortunate throughout my career and I've had a lot of fun doing it."
 
 "I didn't feel very confident coming into tonight," he continued. "But, the horses showed up and we got lucky. I am really glad my family was able to be here tonight and to have that one under my belt."
 
 For the year, Wrenn has won 62 races with 36 of those victories coming at Hoosier Park, which lands him eighth in the leading driver standings at Hoosier Park for the 2018 season. Wrenn and his wife, Melanie, have three children, Tyler, Billy, and Courtney. The Wrenns relocated to Indiana in 2009 and have a successful training operation based out of Central Indiana.
 
 Live racing at Hoosier Park Racing &amp; Casino will continue on Wednesday, June 20 with a 13-race card. With a daily post time of 6:30 p.m., live racing will follow a Tuesday through Saturday schedule and be conducted through November 10.

          WILKES-BARRE PA - Here are the fields for Saturday's elimination races to determine the various Championship finalists on June 30's $2,000,000 Sun Stakes Saturday supercard at The Downs at Mohegan Sun Pocono. Listed are the post position, horse, trainer, driver (in italics if changed at scratch time today), and the morning line odds.
 
 The elimination purses are: $35,000 for the Franklin, $25,000 for the Beal and Hempt, and $20,000 for the Lynch. The Championships are $500,000 for the Franklin, Beal, and Hempt, and $300,000 for the Lynch.

          <div class="tab-content-snippet">
           WILKES-BARRE PA - A "Who's Who" of the free-for-all pacers, three-year-old trotters, and three-year-old pacers both male and female were gathered together at The Downs at Mohegan Sun Pocono Saturday night, trying to perform well in elimination races and qualify for next Saturday's $2,000,000 Sun Stakes Saturday Championships race card. The expected rain thankfully never came, but there was a frontstretch headwind.
 
 FRANKLIN PACE (FFA p)
 
 Heaven Rocks A proved best in a cavalry charge to the wire, sweeping off cover to reduce his Stateside mark to 1:49.3 in the first of three $30,000 Franklin elims. Check Six moved to the lead after the 26.1 opener, got to the midpoint in 54.1, then was challenged by first-over Western Fame to the 1:22 ¾ pole.
 
 Heaven Rocks A tipped three-wide midturn, was (as has been his norm) a bit hard to keep on a maximum course late on the turn, but then showed determination to withstand late-charging Donttellmeagain by a neck, with Western Fame holding stoutly for third and a Franklin final spot. Ross Croghan trains the winner of $414,145, and driver David Miller co-owns him with the Let It Ride Stables Inc. and Dana Parham.
 
 McWicked made winning look McEasy despite a first-over journey, winning handily for driver Brian Sears in 1:48.3. Mach It So set the early pace of 26 and 54.2, then had to contend with the inexorable McGrind of the winner. McWicked took the lead shortly after the 1:21.2 ¾, then finished out in 27.1, 2Â¾ lengths ahead of Rockin Ron, who split horses late to just get second over longshot Mac's Jackpot, who photoed Mach It So for advancement to next week's Championship.
 
 Casie Coleman conditions the veteran son of McArdle, who now is at $2,394,362 in career earnings, for S S G Stables.
 
 Sintra, sitting third headstretch, ducked far inside for the stretch drive and did get to the wire first in 1:48.4 in his Franklin elim, but he went inside the pylons in doing so and was placed third, elevating All Bets Off, who missed a nose after setting much of the pace (54.2, 1:21), to the big share of the purse.
 
 Filibuster Hanover, sitting in the pocket after taking the early lead (26.1) then yielding and to All Bets Off's immediate left through the lane, was third placed second to halt his undefeated 2018 season, with Sintra's placement back to third still enough to get him through to the Championship.
 
 All Bets Off, who sat a world record here three years ago that still stands, was another successful teaming for Team Kakaley/Burke, nudging his earnings up to $2,990,054 for Burke Racing Stable LLC, Weaver Bruscemi LLC, Frank Baldachino, and the Panhellenic Stable Corporation.
 
 BEAL TROT (3YO Open trot)
 
 Manchego kept her career record perfect after 15 starts, but in taking on "the boys" in her $25,000 Beal Trot elim she was extended further than she had ever been before, holding off a game Crystal Fashion by a nose while equaling her career best of 1:52.4.
 
 Yannick Gingras kept the filly in midpack until traffic settled late on the first turn, then got her in gear before the 26.4 quarter, brushed to the lead, and got relatively soft middle fractions of 56 and 1:24.4. But through the stretch Crystal Fashion, who had ducked inside from second-over an 1/8 of a mile out, gained steadily, with Gingras chasing after the super filly late to maintain the victory and The Streak, in only her third race of the year.
 
 Jimmy Takter trains the winning daughter of Muscle Hill, who now has earnings of $929,688 for the ownership of Black Horse Racing, John Fielding, and Herb Liverman.
 
 Ohio champion Mission Accepted proved he was the real deal against Grand Circuit stock by taking the first of the Beal eliminations in 1:53.2.
 
 Those who had backed the Manofmanymissions colt to 4-5 had a few anxious moments down the back as their choice significantly gapped the cover of Patent Leather, who went his third split in 26.4 to clear pacesetter Whats The Word. But driver Ryan Stahl got more out of Mission Accepted and gained on the turn, then dove down into an open Pocono Pike, trotting away late for a 1¼ length tally over Patent Leather, with Lawmaker, forwardly-placed throughout, taking third.
 
 The winner, perfect in four starts this year and the OhSS Final victor at two, now has a bankroll of $268,300 for trainer Jeff Conger, who is also the co-owner with Knox Services Inc. and David Wills.
 
 Six Pack started from post six in his Beal elim, then recorded all "1"s across his charted line, withstanding a late Pocono Pike rush from Evaluate by ¾ of a length to win in 1:53.3. Trainer-driver Ã…ke Svanstedt put the New York star right on the lead, and after a 29.3 second quarter breather the son of Muscle Mass flew home in 56 - 27.4.
 
  
 
 Evaluate (at .90 odds to Six Pack's .80*), in the pocket, raced strongly in the lane to maintain second, with Fashionwoodchopper showing grit to hold on for third and advancement after having to go first-over. Six Pack now shows earnings of $345,055 for Ã…ke Svanstedt Inc., Little E LLC, and Stall Kalmar FF.
 
 HEMPT PACE (3YO c/g pace)
 
 They saved the best for last on Sun Stakes Saturday elimination night, as the I'm Gorgeous colt Lather Up brought to mind another recent good horse (Wiggle something or other) by making the lead past the Â¼, then coming home in 53.1 in hand late for driver Montrell Teague to freeze the timer in 1:49 in his $25,000 Hempt elimination.
 
 After the 26.2 opener put down by Nutcracker Suite, Lather Up, three-wide just past the 1/8, raced up to grab command, got a huge breather with a 55.4 half, and then asserted his divisional dominance with the brilliant last half, winning by 2Â¼ lengths over Nutcracker Suite, with Wes Delight edging Well Done to move on to the Championship.
 
 But someone will have to go a big mile in seven days time to defeat Lather Up, trained by Clyde Francis and moving his bankroll to $544,765 for owners Gary and Barbara Iles, who saw their pride and joy remain undefeated in seven seasonal starts and add a seasonal record to his ever-growing resume.
 
 Dorsoduro Hanover made a swift move to the lead before the 5/8 in the first of the Hempt elims, then held on gamely over the late charge of Springsteen by a neck, with forwardly-placed This Is The Plan, looped for the lead down the back, coming back to be another neck off the 1:49.4 winner to complete the trio to advance.
 
 The victorious Somebeachsomewhere gelding took a new lifetime mark and set a season's record (so it only lasted 55 minutes ...), running his 2018 record to 4-for-5 this season while taking his earnings to $172,668. Matt Kakaley handled sulky duties for trainer Ron Burke and the partnership of Burke Racing Stables LLC; Silva, Purnel &amp; Libby; Weaver Bruscemi LLC; and the Wingfield Five.
 
 Hitman Hill paid a 26.2 price to get the lead before the quarter, put down 54.4 and 1:22.1 middle splits, then lasted to the wire by a head over inside charger Shnitzledosomethin in 1:49.3, a personal best and a tick better than Dorsoduro Hanover divisional season's record. Stay Hungry, who found all sorts of trouble, out to the quarter before tucking from PP8, then checking when the first-over broke before the ¾, rallied stoutly for third to advance.
 
 Hitman Hill is a son of American Ideal who was guided by Brett Miller for trainer Chris Oakes, and the ownership of Tom Hill and Northfork Racing Stable.
 
 LYNCH PACE (3YO filly pace)
 
 Youaremycandygirl, looking more like her 2017 championship self, took the first $20,000 Lynch elimination on the engine in 1:51.3. Yannick Gingras was out to the 27.1 quarter to make the lead behind the daughter of American Ideal, then tripped the timer at the half in 56.2 before Alexa's Power moved up to challenge.
 
 The 6-5 second choice pacesetter (the first non-favorite to win in the eliminations after five straight chalk) and the 1-2* first-over battled to and past the 1:23.2 3/4s, with Alexa's Power dropping in the pocket at headstretch and second-over Double A Mint coming quickly in the lane. The "Candygirl" (named after a line in a song by the "group" The Archies) held off Double A Mint by a neck, with Alexa's Power and Hypnotic Tale next in line. Ron Burke conditions the winner of $925,915, 2-for-4 this year and 11-for-15 lifetime, for owner W. J. Donovan.
 
 Kissin In The Sand left to the early lead, let Sidewalk Dancer go by at the half, then surged in the Pocono Pike midstretch to catch that rival by a half length in 1:51.1 in the other Lynch elim. Sidewalk Dancer was out the whole way in the 26.4 quarter and almost to the half in 55 before clearing the winning favorite, went to the Â¾ in 1:23.1, but succumbed to the pocket rocket late, with I'm Trigger Happy, Sansovina Hanover, and Serene Stride (the faster 5th-place finisher) going on to the Championship.
 
 Kissin In The Sand was driven by Scott Zeron for trainer Nancy Johansson, and the daughter of Somebeachsomewhere has earnings of $345,545 for owners Marvin Katz and the Hatfield Stables.
 
 GREAT NORTHEAST OPEN SERIES (top older pacers)
 
 Why did he include a $30,000 race, the Great Northeast event, in this wrapup? How about because the winner, Bettor's Edge, equaled the fastest mile of the year on a 5/8-mile track in North America by winning in 1:48.2?
 
 How about because the fractions were 25.1, 53.3, and 1:20, and the nine-year-old winner set most of the pace? Rodeo Romeo got past Bettor's Edge after the astounding quarter, but then the winner of $2,133,382 was out and retaking for Scott Zeron in front of the stands and "got a rest" to the half.
 
 Then Highalator came first-over and got a small advantage late backstretch through the smoking 3/4s, but the winner held him off, then withstood the Pocono Pike late move of Rodeo Romeo to tally by a Â½ length for trainer Jennifer Lappe, also the co-owner with Robert Santagata; Highalator was only a neck further back in third.

          <div class="tab-content-snippet">
           YONKERS, NY, Saturday, June 23, 2018-Marion Marauder (Jordan Stratton, $3.40) returned to Westchester Saturday night (June 23rd), winning Yonkers Raceway's co-featured $44,000 Open Handicap Trot.
 
 The 2016 Trotting Triple Crown winner, in his first local visit since finishing second in last fall's million-dollar Yonkers International Trot, was unsurprisingly better than his seven inside foes. Marion Marauder just sat out there, moving from seventh to fifth at the half (:27, :57).
 
 He advanced down the backside the second time, making up ground even though they weren't going that much up front. Marion Marauder went three-wide around Madhatter Bluechip (Joe Bongiorno), setting his sights on leading Bluebird Jesse (Brent Holland) passing a 1:25.3 three-quarters.
 
 The odds-on choice took over soon after, opening a length-and-a-half into the lane. He then held off Smalltownthrowdown (Dan Dube) by a half-length in 1:55.1.
 
 It was the 2016 Yonkers Trot all over again, except Stratton (six winners during Saturday's dozen-race card) was cast in the role of Scott Zeron and Dube subbing for Dan Daley behind the runnerup. Daley had Smalltownthrowdown at 2 and 3.
 
 Third went to DW's NY Yank (George Brennan), with Bluebird Jesse and Madhatter Bluechip rounding out the payees.
 
 For Marion Marauder, a 5-year-old son of Muscle Hill co-owned by Marion Wellwood and Devin Keeling &amp; trained by the tandem of Paula Wellwood and Mike Keeling (Ms. Wellwood is listed stateside), it was his second win in four seasonal starts (career earnings up over $2.6 million). The exacta paid $37.60, the triple returned $169 and the superfecta paid $371.50.
 
 Saturday night's co-featured $44,000 Open Handicap Pace was won by Always at May Place (Brennan, $12) in 1:51.1, a 40th career victory by far a season's-best effort.

          <div class="tab-content-snippet">
           Western Redhot (Leon Bailey) fired late to take the Vernon Downs featured pace ($6,000) on Saturday (June 23). Bailey and John MacDonald each won four races on the night.
 
 Dark Prince (Adam Capizzano) put up the first two fractions (:26.2, :56.2). Prince Aland (Truman Gale) took over leading the group to three-quarters in 1:25.1.
 
 Western Redhot ($22.80) , who is owned and trained by Dustin Ingraham, flew down the stretch and blew right by to win easily in 1:54.0. Prince Aland was second with Gingertreefinnegan (John MacDonald) finishing third.
 
 Western Redhot is a 5-year-old gelding by Western Ideal. It was his second win this season and his seventh career victory. Bailey also had wins with Credit List ($6.90), Royal Bahama ($8.20), and Sports Vision ($23.00).
 
 John MacDonald had wins with Dunks Brother ($24.00), Mac's Black Hat ($7.90), Maradona ($4.60), and Sapient Hanover ($2.20) A correction from Friday's racing.

 Golden Brit (Adam Capizzano) led to the first quarter in :27.2.
 
 
 Maradona ($4.60) who is owned by Victor Finnocchiaro and trained by MacDonald , took control after the first quarter putting up the rest of the fractions (:57.1, 1:25.2, 1:53.2).  He would battle second place finisher, Prince Pinang (Artie Dick) all the way down the stretch.  Finishing third was Golden Brit.  
 
  
 
 Maradona is an 8-year-old gelding by Western Terror.  It was his fourth win this season and career win number 22.   MacDonald had his other wins with Dunks Brother ($24.00), Mac's Black Hat ($7.90), and Sapient Hanover ($2.20)   A correction from Friday's racing.  MacDonald had five wins instead of four.  His last win last night came with Jaclyn Hanover ($2.20).  That makes nine wins for MacDonald the weekend at Vernon Downs.

            Caramore Final at Big M to Mike's Powerhouse
           </a>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content-snippet">
           EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - After finishing a solid second and third, respectively, in his two preliminaries, Mike's Powerhouse upped his game Saturday night, saving his best effort for the Caramore Series Final, winning the $20,850 harness racing feature at the Meadowlands for non-winners of $20,000 in 2018 on the pace.
 
 Driver Vinny Ginsburg, who won three races on the evening, put the 6-year-old gelded son of Camluck on the lead around the first turn from the rail and hit the quarter in :26.2. The eventual winner got a :57.3 breather through the middle half as Rockinwiththebest, the slight 3-2 favorite, popped out the four hole at the three-eighths and inched his way toward the leader on the rim.
 
 But Mike's Powerhouse brought just enough through a final quarter of :26.4 to hold off the late-charging Astor, who finished a neck back. Rockinwiththebest held on for third. Byby Landon, the slight 3-2 second choice, was blocked in the pocket and had to settle for fifth.
 
 Mike's Powerhouse returned $11.80 to win as the third choice in the wagering and completed the mile in a lifetime-best 1:50.4 for trainer Vincent Fusco Jr.
 
 RED MAN, BLACK INK: Driver Eric Abbatiello continued to endear himself to value players Saturday, guiding one 6-1 shot and a 9-2 chance to victory lane. This after his 22-1 score on the Friday card.
 
 FAVES NOT FAB: After post-time choices went only 2-for-9 on the Friday program, the chalk players probably felt they were due for a big night Saturday, but it wasn't to be.
 
 The first 10 chalks failed before Music Is Art clicked at 4-5 in the finale.
 
 For the race week, favorites went 3-for-20 (15 percent).
 
 A LITTLE MORE: Wagering was down when compared to the comparable card from a year ago, with short fields the main culprit. During the course of the night, four fields had but six betting interests at post time. On last year's card, the average numbers of starters per race was 8.2. This year, it was 7.2. Last year, the total wagered was $2,229,350. This year, it was $1,878,057, a decrease of 15.8 percent. ... One lucky player betting into the Elite Turf Club hub raked the pot in the Early 20-Cent Jackpot Super High-Five. He or she who held the only ticket with the winning combination of 1-8-6-2-5 in the ninth race cashed in for $16,154. ... The Late 20-Cent Jackpot Super High-Five failed to result in a single-ticket winner, bloating the carryover to $265,472. ... Racing resumes at the Big M Friday at 7:15 p.m.
