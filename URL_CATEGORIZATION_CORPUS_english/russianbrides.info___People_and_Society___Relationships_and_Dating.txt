          <p>
           To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary
                            Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitrator
                            will allocate all costs and fees attributable to the arbitration between the parties hereto equally.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
           </strong>
           If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration
           <strong>
            we each waive any right to a jury trial
           </strong>
           . We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse
                            of intellectual property rights.
          </p>
          <p>
           You will attempt to resolve all disputes with respect to the Services through communication with RussianBrides's customer service. If parties are unable to resolve the dispute, You must use the dispute resolution mechanism discussed above in this Section
                            14. You specifically acknowledge and agree that You will not attempt to chargeback any charges you authorized if you used the goods and/or Services provided. You further agree that should RussianBrides demonstrate that a chargeback
                            was unjustifiable, You shall incur an additional administrative charge of five cents ($ .05) cents per dollar of the amount of the chargeback. Such charge is not intended as a penalty, rather it shall be used to cover the administrative
                            expenses incurred by RussianBrides in connection with the chargeback. You shall also be required to pay any and all fees assessed by a credit card, bank or any other third party with respect to the chargeback which may range from
                            $20 to $200 per chargeback, together with any reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs incurred by RussianBrides with respect to the reversal of said chargeback. Please also note should you chargeback any transactions billed to
                            your account, RussianBrides may be required to disclose any and/or all private communications sent/received by You through our Service in order to prove the validity of the charges billed to Your account and RussianBrides's privacy
                            policy will therefore not restrain any such disclosures.
