       A special note to our friends
      </h1>
      <p>
       BibleWorks has been serving the church for 26 years by  providing a suite of professional tools aimed at enabling students of the Word  to “rightly divide the word of truth”. But it has become increasingly apparent  over the last few years that the need for our services has diminished to the  point where we believe the Lord would have us use our gifts in other ways.
       <strong>
        As of June 15, 2018 BibleWorks ceased operation as a provider  of Bible software tools.
       </strong>
       We made this announcement with sadness, but also with  gratitude to God and thankfulness to a multitude of faithful users who have  stayed with us for a large part of their adult lives. We know that you will  have many questions going forward and we will do our best to answer some of  them here.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Can I continue to use  BibleWorks on a PC?
      </h3>
      <p>
       If you have a valid license for
       <i>
        BibleWorks
       </i>
       <i>
        10
       </i>
       you can continue to use the program as usual.
       <strong>
        We will, Lord willing, continue  to provide compatibility fixes for
        <i>
         BibleWorks 10
        </i>
        well into  the future.
       </strong>
       This will ensure that you can continue to use the program for the  long term. Compatibility updates will be provided through the normal updater  mechanism within the program.
      </p>
      <h3>
       What about the Mac version of the  program?
      </h3>
      <p>
       BibleWorks updates for the PC will also work on the Mac  platform.  We will do our best to  insure compatibility of BibleWorks 10 with future Mac OS changes but the  situation is more complex than with the PC platform. The coming macOS  versions require 64-bit programs. BibleWorks is in good shape for this, and we  will soon release a full x64 Mac Installer dmg. We will also be working with CodeWeavers  to explore options for them to continue compatibility support for the  BibleWorks Mac Installer. Finally, in any case, Mac users will likely be able  to fall back to using a virtual machine (like Virtual Box, Fusion, or  Parallels).
      </p>
      <h3>
       Will any support for the  program be available after June 15, 2018?
      </h3>
      <p>
       After June 15, 2018 program support will no longer be  available via e-mail or telephone. However, we will keep the
       <a href="forums">
        BibleWorks forum
       </a>
       active so that users can continue to interact and get help from each other. We  will also keep the
       <a href="https://kb.bibleworks.com">
        BibleWorks Knowledge Base
       </a>
       active to provide answers to the  most common questions about BibleWorks functionality. We will endeavor to keep  these support alternatives available for as long as they are useful to users.
      </p>
      <h3>
       What about versions of  BibleWorks prior to version 10?
      </h3>
      <p>
       After June 15, 2018, versions of BibleWorks prior to version 10  will no longer be supported.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How can I backup and restore my current installation?
      </h3>
      <p>
       At the end of June program and  database updates will no longer be available online, except for the BibleWorks  10 maintenance updates referred to earlier. If you want to install or reinstall  BibleWorks at a later date:
      </p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
       <li>
        Ensure you have keep your BibleWorks activation codes in a safe place.
       </li>
       <li>
        BibleWorks 10 users will       need to download the final installation media image (available on our website in July) and       use it for future installations.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         If you have a version       prior to 10, you need to back up your BibleWorks folder now
        </strong>
        using whatever backup       program you prefer. If you need to reinstall BibleWorks later, use your       original installation media to install BibleWorks, followed by a       restoration of the backup.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
       Do I Still Have a Chance to License BibleWorks 10?
      </h3>
      <p>
       BibleWorks products are no longer available for licensing.

      <p>
       We continue to pray that the Lord would provide a way for the program to continue, and we are exploring some possibilities. But there are no definite plans at present for future development. We thank the many thousands of people who over the last quarter century have used and supported BibleWorks. May the Lord bless your continued labors for His glory.
