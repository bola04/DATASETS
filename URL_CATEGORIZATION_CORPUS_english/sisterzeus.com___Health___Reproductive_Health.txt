       This web site is about empowering women by
       <br/>
       educating ourselves and each other about our fertility.
       <p>
        This site is geared toward women who
        <br/>
        want to avoid getting pregnant and
        <br/>
        who wish to take a proactive stance
        <br/>
        regarding our health and wellbeing
       </p>
       <p>
        Here you will find a wealth of information about
        <br/>
        our menstrual cycles,
        <br/>
        how our bodies work.
        <br/>
        Information I feel every woman
        <br/>
        should have access to and knowledge about.
       </p>
       <p>
        For more than 18 years, I have had a particular interest in
        <br/>
        natural birth control, and fertility awareness.
        <br/>
        How herbs can be used to influence the menstrual cycle,
        <br/>
        to promote or decrease fertility,
        <br/>
        and to disrupt pregnancy in its earliest stages.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have opted to share many of my experiences
        <br/>
        including one with the Human Papilloma virus (HPV).
        <br/>
        My goal is to encourage women to educate themselves,
        <br/>
        rather than giving away personal power to the medical establishment.
        <br/>
        The doctor's word is not law, and they only know what they've been taught.
        <br/>
        You can look at things through their window...
        <br/>
        or choose to see the view from more than one window.
        <br/>
        The choice between a narrow view or the wide angle view.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a firm believer that we have a right to know all the options available.
        <br/>
        I would like to share some of what I have learned
        <br/>
        about the lesser known options, including
        <br/>
        Holistic, natural treatment of cervical dysplasia,
        <br/>
        herbal contraception, herbal abortion and menstrual extraction.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are only limited in what we can do or acheive by ourselves,
        <br/>
        and those to whom we give our power away to;
        <br/>
        to the things that we choose to see or to beleive in.
       </p>
       <p>
        So grab a cup of tea, make yourself comfortable and come on in
        <br/>
        I invite you to share in some of the things that I have learned so far
        <br/>
        in my journey through this life.
        <br/>
        While some of these things may not be the right option for you...
        <br/>
        it is good, to know what options are out there.
