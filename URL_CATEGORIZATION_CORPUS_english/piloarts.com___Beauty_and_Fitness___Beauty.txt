                   Went to Pilo Arts Hair and Skin Salon for the first time. I have 
 			lived in Brooklyn my whole life and was very loyal to a salon I have 
 			been going to for 15 years. Was not as happy with my cuts and 
 			service as I was in the past. Someone recommended I try Sia for a 
 			new look. She was great, listened to me and was very generous with 
 			her time and suggestions.
                   <br/>
                   I now am loyal to Sia and Pilo Arts and found a new hair and skin 
 			salon.

 			here cause parking is a bit of a pain. They serve cappuccino, tea 
 			and wine complimentary too.

                   I have been to pilo arts in January for a haircut conditioning 
 			treatment and blowout. This is a deal I purchased on Groupon. My 
 			stylist was Jessica and let me tell you she is a pro. I loved the 
 			way my haircut came out. So needless to say I recommended it my 
 			friends and 3 of them went to see her as well and all 3 girls loved 
 			it and are now permanent costumers!! Also its a very beautiful salon 
 			with excellent customer service. The front desk is handled by Blake 
 			who knows how to deal with a large volume of calls and clients and 
 			maintains a great friendly and very accommodating attitude. I am 
 			going back to Jessica next month to get highlights!!

                   I can't say enough good things about Jessica. I had started to go to 
 			another highly reviewed salon on 5th Avenue where they completely 
 			wrecked my hair with bad highlights. I decided to go back to Pilo 
 			after seeing a groupon for a highlight and cut. I first saw Jessica 
 			with a Groupon and she was phenomenal. She fixed my bad highlight 
 			job and gave me a great cut. I knew immediately I would be back and 
 			on my way out someone at the front desk offered me 50% off of my 
 			next visit with Jessica - I was already sold so an extra discount 
 			was icing on the cake. I've since been back to see Jessica 4 times, 
 			most recently to get a Brazilian Blowout which was completely worth 
 			every penny. If you're looking for an amazing stylist that will 
 			listen to exactly what you want make an appointment with Jessica 
 			ASAP!

                   I bought a groupon for pilo arts for a haircut, condition, and a 
 			single process.
                   <br/>
                   I made an appointment and came in last Friday at 9:30am, the salon 
 			was almost empty, which perfect because it was very calm.
                   <br/>
                   I was immediately greeted by my stylist, Anna. She's beautiful 
 			herself so I felt safe in her hands. She was warm and listed to what 
 			I wanted to do, and told me her concerns with my hair; that it's 
 			very damaged and I need to stop dying it and let it rest for a 
 			while, hitting the nail on the head. I came in to get an all over 
 			color closest to my natural hair color so that I don't touch it 
 			again. She worked quickly and talked with me almost the whole time 
 			so the process seemed much quicker. She shampooed and conditioned 
 			and then applied gloss to my hair which made it so shiny and feel so 
 			healthy!
                   <br/>
                   She then proceeded to cut my hair (which she cut a little too much 
 			of) but maybe it's because I went from a v shape cut to a straight 
 			across. I'm still upset about that, but when I looked in the mirror 
 			once she finished blow drying my hair I was blown away. my hair 
 			couldn't have looked more fabulous, I didn't even recognize it! I 
 			wish we took a video of the way she tossed my hair. Absolutely 
 			gorgeous job, although shorter than I wanted, my hair feels 
 			healthier and I'm really happy with my visit.
                   <br/>
                   I left the salon at 11:45am and got so many compliments and looks 
 			that day. Thank you, Anna!

                   Hermina is a great stylist; she listened to what I was looking for

 			I'll be going back to her and Pilo again for sure!

 			Jessica was super sweet and listened to all my concerns and 
 			questions regarding my balayage. She explained to me each step by 
 			step and even answered all my after care and up keep questions. I 
 			did not feel like I received a different t treatment for using 
 			Groupon and that was refreshing! I finally found a honest and 
 			professional salon in bay ridge. As a personal note, I think if you 
 			are using a Groupon and the hair stylist did a great job, the tip 
 			should be as if it was full price. In love with my hair

                   I've been going to Pilo Arts for years. I'm usually not picky with 
 			stylists because I've been pretty happy with anyone I get but my 
 			last visit I had Sia. She was the best so far. Very honest and 
 			knowledgeable. I will be going to her again and trust that she will 
 			have my best interest in mind.

                   Went there with a Groupon. My hair was a mess from other salon, I 
 			wasn't thrilled to pay another 200$ to fix my hair so i got the 
 			Groupon. I was afraid that they might make it worse but the girl in 
 			Pilo Arts, i believe her name was Hermina, did an amazing job! She 
 			even used two different colors to fix my hair and I really like what 
 			she did. The reason for 4stars and not 5 is only the way they treat 
 			Groupon customers. I believe the reason for offering Groupon deals 
 			is attracting customers, but the way they communicate with them is 
 			not really appealing.

                   When you go into a salon for the first time after having had the 
 			same hair cut, style, and color for years the amount of confusion 
 			and anxiety is unimaginable. Do I want bangs? Should I try a short 
 			cut for the first time in almost 10 years ? What happens if it's not 
 			what I imagined? All this raced through my mind in the days leading 
 			up to my appointment, and even through the first 10 minutes. Then I 
 			met Sia. I told her my ideas and what treatments, and products I use 
 			and she got to work. While she was styling my hair she told me I had 
 			supersaturated colors of red and showed me what I had been doing to 
 			my hair all these years. Now I'm leaving the coloring to her 
 			completely and I'm so excited to go back and get started on my new 
 			look! I originally went in for a cut and style through a Groupon 
 			gift, and I couldn't be happier that I got that appointment with Sia. 
 			I'll definitely be recommending her as my go stylist, and can't wait 
 			to see her work her magic on my colorful disaster!

                   I had an up-do done by Alessandra, and believe me when I tell you 
 			she is a hair wizard!!! I showed her a picture of what I wanted 
 			done, and she made magic happen. My hair didn't look exactly like 
 			what I had showed her, but it was no less beautiful. Most 
 			importantly, every strand of hair stayed in place from the time I 
 			left the salon until 2AM that evening when I undid my hair, after 
 			hours of being outdoors and dancing at a wedding.
                   <br/>
                   My up-do cost just over $100 with tax; a great deal, considering how

                   <br/>
                   I used a Groupon. I was greeted by the shampoo lady and offered 
 			wine. I was greeted with a smile by Jessica. She took the time to 
 			listen to my wants and looked at a picture of how I wanted my hair 
 			to result in. She was attentive, friendly, beautiful, patient, 
 			talented and aimed to please.
                   <br/>
                   Jessica gave me great advise on caring for my color and finally gave 
 			me a very stylish cut. She blew my hair out first (after the 
 			highlights and shampoo) and focused on how the cut would around my 
 			face when it was actually dry. The cut was on point....The 
 			highlights were on point...The service was on point. Jessica spent a 
 			good 4 hours on me. Due to using the Groupon i was given 50% off my 
 			2nd visit, which i will use.
                   <br/>
                   If you need advise on who to get a cut or highlights, just ask for 
 			JESSICA. And make sure to take care of her (tip$$) when you are 
 			finished, because she will make sure to take care of you. Did I 
 			mention she is very educated. She has a degree is Psychology. She's 
 			very smart and we talked a lot.

                   My Bridal Party, (5 girls) and I used Pilo Arts for the day of my 
 			Wedding. Each of us left Pilo looking absolutely GORGEOUS. I ordered 
 			some bagels and juice to be delivered there upon opening, and much 
 			to my pleasure, it was completely not frowned upon by staff or 
 			management. Instead, I was hailed as a very responsible, thoughtful 
 			Bride. Hooray for compliments! :) Fendi did my hair, and what an 
 			outstanding job she did!!! I had brought her a picture for my trial 
 			a month prior, and was impressed. The day of? I was FLOORED by the 
 			perfect job she did! Suzanne did ALL of our makeup, and her makeup 
 			artistry skills were full force on my Wedding Day! Although my 
 			makeup idea differed from hers, she very reasonably explained that 
 			the day was going to be over 100*, and she didn't want the makeup to 
 			wear off. I eventually relented, and I'm so happy that I did!!! My 
 			makeup stayed true and perfect for 13+ hours! Between Suzanne and 
 			Fendi, my Wedding Day looks could not have been better. THANK YOU 
 			BOTH! The staff at Pilo, while having a notorious reputation for 
 			being snooty and aloof, was anything but. They were accommodating, 
 			patient, and friendly.

                    I have never been to Pilo Arts before but since I had a gift 
 			certificate for a cut and blow, I decided to have my hair colored as 
 			well. Rano was my hairstylist and at first I was uncertain whether I 
 			was going to be happy with the outcome. I told Rano that I wanted 
 			something that would frame my face and have layers. She did the 
 			rest. After coloring my hair she gave me a cut and then a "Brazilian 
 			Blow Out". My hair, which is naturally curly and to me very 
 			unmanageable was now as straight as a board. I posted the pic on 
 			Facebook and received about 40 comments and likes. It was amazing. 
 			Some people did not even recognize me. I felt more attractive than I 
 			had in my entire life. I have Rano to thank for that and will 
 			definitely be back in a month for the same treatment. While pricey, 
 			you really do get what you pay for at Pilo Arts.

                   I needed a change. Opted with OmbrÃ© with a Master stylist. I've had 
 			an ombrÃ© before and loved it. Cost me a fortune and I left not 
 			completely thrilled with the outcome. I thought it would grow on me 
 			but I just ended up hating it. $240 down the drain. The color just 
 			did not suit my face whatsoever and made my hair look completely 
 			dead. So I came back one month later and just wanted to go back to 
 			my normal brunette color. The ombrÃ© ruined any hope I ever had in 
 			'change'. Bleh. So I had Colleen to fix me up and she was lovely. 
 			Listened to exactly what I had in mind and went above and beyond to 
 			make sure I loved it. I will be coming back to her for now on for 
 			future cuts and color.

                   Stefanie is an absolute artist! She has been cutting my hair for 
 			well over 6 years, fashioning me with everything from trims to full 
 			blown style changes (even a pixie!). Stefanie somehow managed to 
 			make the growing out process livable - a hard task when "recovering" 
 			from a super short 'do. Today was my first time dabbling in the 
 			color realm, and Stefanie far exceeded my expectations. As always, I 
 			walked out the door happy, confident, and with a gorgeous head of 
 			hair. When you go to Pilo, you're getting the best. With the prices 
 			in NYC, you're getting an absolute steal for the quality of the cut 
 			and color.

                    <br/>
                    Pain was very minimal for a wax, and she got all that hair out by 
 			the root. You know how sometimes you go for a wax, but some of the 
 			hair rips and the root stays? Not with This wax. All my hair was 
 			completely out.
                    <br/>
                    This type of wax is very low on mess, and I feel so good and clean 
 			right now. Im walking and talking a little differently and feeling 
 			like quite the fancy pants. Dilcia also gave me plenty of tips on 
 			how to keep skin healthy and naturally smooth.

                    PS: I also had the pleasure to meet Elena, the owner of the salon.

                    What an AMAZING salon. I throughly enjoyed my experience there. They 
 			far exceed, by a big stretch, any salon I have been to in Manhattan 
 			and Bay Ridge.
                    <br/>
                    Pilo Arts, from the minute I walked in was buzzing. A busy salon 
 			means a popular salon with a large happy clientele.
                    <br/>
                    I was greeted with a smile, offered a drink, and my coat was taken 
 			and hung. I sat down in pure bliss, thinking to myself "now this is 
 			luxury." as I nibbled on the pretzels provided.
                    <br/>
                    I barely sat waiting for more than 5 mins before being led away to 
 			the wash basin where I got the most incredible shampoo - I love head 
 			massages. After my wash I was taken to my stylist Paul who gave me 
 			an incredible color, cut and blow out, I walked out there feeling 
 			like I was on top of the world. What was amazing too was they ran on 
 			time despite how busy they were.
                    <br/>
                    Pilo arts, I love you guys and can't wait to come back. Your prices 
 			are low considering what a top notch salon you are and I am 
 			impressed by all your awards, I can see why you are ranked as one of 
 			the top 5 color salons in NY. I can't wait to come back for another 
 			5 star treatment and will def spread the word to my fellow 
 			colleagues, friends and family members.

                    I have been going to Pilo Arts for many years now. The five star 
 			service starts as soon as you walk in to the minute you leave. First 
 			being greeted by the staff at the front desk. Always being offered 
 			something to drink and even to snack on while you wait just a short 
 			time for your pampering service to begin. Never waited more then 5 
 			minutes.
                    <br/>
                    Every time I walk into the salon there are always crowds of people 
 			getting pampered just like me. Usually clients that keep coming back 
 			over and over again just because the services are top notch. 
 			(Nothing better)
                    <br/>
                    Now being a mom to a busy toddler I look forward to heading out to 
 			Pilo Arts for my day of pampering. You can always count on anyone of 
 			the experienced employees at Pilo Arts to help keep you up with 
 			today's hair and makeup.
                    <br/>
                    I highly recommend anyone looking for a amazing salon with top notch 
 			employees try Pilo Arts. You won't be disappointed and I bet you 
 			will continue going back.

                   Pilo Arts Day Spa and Salon is the best salon you can go to in 
 			Brooklyn or Staten Island. I have been going to this salon for years 
 			and love it. The Staff is friendly and nice, always trying to make 
 			you feel good and wants you to have a great experience from the time 
 			you walk in the door to when you are ready to leave. The service I 
 			love the most at Pilo is getting my hair done. Recently I have been 
 			seeing Danielle Pietroluongo for my hair services and this stylist 
 			is amazing. From cutting to color she knows her stuff. I have been 
 			getting highlights for over 3 years and have been wanting to do 
 			something different, but anyone i saw would tell me stuck to 
 			highlights it looks good on you and brings out your eyes. My husband 
 			has always wanted me to go darker with my hair color and people 
 			would always tell me don't do it your skin is too fair and you will 
 			look pale and morbid. I told Danielle i wanted something different 
 			and told her my concerns with going darker but she picked out an 
 			awesome color and made me feel so comfortable I trusted her 
 			judgement as a professional. I was so happy with the results. My 
 			hair looks so healthy and shiny with my new color, also it gave me a 
 			new look. All my friends can't stop telling me how much they love my 
 			hair darker &amp; I think the darker hair makes my eye color stand out 
 			more. Now I have been back to her about 3 times for touch ups and 
 			every time it looks better then the last. She knows her stuff when 
 			it comes to color and picking color that will compliment your skin 
 			type and features to make you look beautiful. She is also very good 
 			at cutting and styling. I recently went to a wedding and went to see 
 			Danielle the morning of the wedding. I told her I wanted my hair 
 			styled but I did not want anything fancy as an up-do. Well she made 
 			me look and feel sexy and beautiful the way she waved and curled my 
 			hair. It was bouncy and lasted all night. All I have to say is go 
 			see her, she listens to what her customer wants but also gives 
 			suggestions on how to make the style work for them. Her prices are 
 			also very reasonable, you can't go wrong.

 			which provides me with all the necessary facilities and 
 			accommodations that I need when it comes to getting a decent 
 			haircut. Pilo arts provides a terrific ambience with warm and 
 			friendly staff members whose main function is to assist clients to 
 			feel comfortable and relaxed while having their hair styled by some 
 			of the best stylists on this planet. I was fortunate enough to 
 			reconnect with Danielle, a kind and talented hair stylist, who I had 
 			the pleasure of working on my hair for some time when she was at 
 			another salon. Clearly her ability has improved significantly, and I 
 			am thrilled to have found her at pilo arts in bay ridge brooklyn. I 
 			can highly recommend Danielle to anyone who wants a professional 
 			hair treatment from one of the best stylists in this City. For any 
 			female who wants to receive only the best will want Danielle for 
 			this purpose. Don't wait another moment. Get on over to pilo arts 
 			Salon quickly as possible....!!

                    Great!Â 
 			I just moved to Brooklyn from Manhattan to raise a family and was of 
 			course worried about finding a close to home salon.Â Â 
 			My hair is hilighted and layered cut.Â Â 
 			My neighbor said the only place to go is Pilo. So I took a chance 
 			and walked in to make the appointment.Â 
 			Very pretty decor and some smiley faces.Â 
 			I said to myself "This is good".
                    <br/>
                    So I asked if they could take now. I lucked out.Â 
 			Their colorist Don had a cancelation and took me rite away.
                    <br/>
                    I wont bore u with the details. But after he did his magic with 
 			foils and some sort of low lites he escorted me over to a stylist 
 			named Nina.
                    <br/>
                    The consultation was great and she did her magic with her scissors.Â 
 			As she was finishing Don came over to check his work.Â 
 			The haircut complimented the color and visa versa!Â 
 			Before i left i booked a massage for my husband in their spa.Â 
 			I highly recommend this place.

                   I 
 			travel all the way to Brooklyn for Pilo.Â 
 			I live in New Jersey but travel for my hair appointments to Brooklyn 
 			for Jayne Chillo at Pilo. The environment is always welcoming, I've 
 			never not been offered multiple drinks or food while waiting for 
 			Jayne (which has never been long either). The salon is clean, 
 			comfortable, stylish, and always friendly. It is always a pleasure 
 			to go and relax at Pilo. I look forward to my trips there because I 
 			always feel pampered.
                   <br/>
                   <br/>
                   Jayne tried her first ombre treatment on me and I loved it! It was 
 			first done last March and has still stayed until now. I let Jayne 
 			suggest me what she thinks will be a good fit for my hair and color 
 			and after so long as her customer, I completely trust her skill and 
 			opinions. She has the ultimate ombre expertise! She is educated and 
 			trained with the best and even does shows to present her work and 
 			teach. Jayne has never steered me wrong with my hair.

                   I just want to say that I have been to this salon several times, and 
 			every time that I come here, I am not only treated great, but I 
 			leave here looking beautiful. When you look good, you feel good, and 
 			the stylists here understand this. They take the time to sit down 
 			with me, and ask me what i like and what i don't like, and this 
 			makes me feel like we are communicating well. Every time I decide to 
 			try a new hair style or color, my stylist advises me to bring a 
 			picture with me. It is great to get what I want, and also to learn 
 			how to keep up with the style. Don't hesitate to come here. You will be so 
 			happy that you did!

                   Can i tell you all how impressed i was , lets start with i have not 
 			been to Pilo Arts in almost 6 years . I received a few phones calls 
 			with great deals . Lately i have been thinking of switching hair 
 			stylists , it was faith. I walked in and right away was greeted with 
 			smiles and offer of coffee , tea , wine , cheese and crackers. The 
 			new front desk made me feel so at home and cozy , Elena the owner 
 			was there as she always is and was so nice to see her and herself 
 			taking care of her business. Shortly after Dimitri greeted me and 
 			brought me over to Nina what a women very attentive and gave me the 
 			best hair cutting consult. The shampoo i had was by far the best 
 			ever . Nina gave me an amazing haircut and the blowout was just as 
 			good . I came in on a very busy day and got to see all the stylist 
 			work and each person in there had there own style and edge , there 
 			work looked beautiful. I will be returning to the salon with nina 
 			often , just so you all know the whole creative team is now having a 
 			15.00 blow out special..

                    I've gone to this salon on and off for the past 12 years. I moved 
 			out New York for seven years but still went to get my hair done 
 			there while visiting every few months. I used to frequently get my 
 			hair cut and highlighted there and they always did a fantastic job. 
 			I haven't been coloring my hair for the past year but still go in 
 			every two months for a trim and they always do a fabulous job. I 
 			don't have a regular stylist there but have never gotten a bad cut 
 			or color there.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The salon itself can be kind of busy but the staff is accommodating 
 			and I've always received excellent service. Everything from checking 
 			your coat when you get there to offering a drink while waiting for 
 			color to process! I'm not sure if they still do training days, but 
 			they used to offer extremely discounted cuts and colors on Tuesdays 
 			by their students. The students were always supervised - sometimes 
 			it took a bit longer but they always did a fine job. Make sure to 
 			book an appointment for training days - they are always full.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My only negative experience was getting a Brazilian wax there a few 
 			years ago. The esthetician was not very nice and she was pretty 
 			rough. I let her know that she was hurting me but she didn't seem to 
 			care. I wouldn't ever go back there for a wax but it is my go to 
 			place for cut and color.

                    best Facial!!!!!Â  5 stars.Â Â 
             I visited Pilo Arts because I needed a facial so bad. I had so many 
             blackheads and whiteheads that made my skin break out every day and 
             needed to remove them. Everytime I went for a facial in Staten 
             Island they ended up making my face worse, and made my skin break 
             out even more. After having the 55 min facial and massage with 
             Tasneem, I felt wonderful. She cleaned my face til I had no more 
             blackheads and she also removed some whitehead that were near my 
             eyes that were very hard to get rid of. I was going to a 
             dermatologist for this problem I had with my skin, but she took care 
             of it and saved me a lot of money. Pilo Arts should hire more people 
             like her, she makes you feel very comfortable, Thanks again Tasneem!!!!!!!! 
             You made me feel fantastic after......I GUESS YOU WILL BE SEEING ME 
             EVERY MONTH!!!!!!!!!

                    Great Salon!!Â 
             This is a wonderful Salon. Are they pricey?? Yeah...but all the good 
             Salons in Bay Ridge are! I started out with Victoria....one day she 
             was busy, so I used Mo....and have gone to him ever since. He's a 
             creative stylist, so his cut costs a little under $50. But here's 
             why I love this salon....I hadn't had a haircut in a while...so they 
             sent me an email asking what they could do to get me back in. I told 
             them that I wanted a discount....well, they did one better---A 
             complimenarty haircut!! Plus, when I went to get my free haircute, I 
             got a voucher for a free manicure! Now, that's a good salon...plus 
             they always have some promo going on if you sign up on their email 
             list.

                   CONGRATULATIONS
             Mr Labarca,
                   <br/>
                   Firstly, I just wanted to take this opportunity, After recognizing 
             you the other night at "Uncle Vinny's comedy club" to CONGRATULATE 
             you and your absolutely STUNNING fiance on the upcoming arrival of 
             your son. If he looks anything like the 2 of you he's going to be 
             one handsome little boy.
                   <br/>
                   Secondly, it's been years, since I moved to Staten Island, that I 
             was last in Pilo. Seeing you, and dare I say, better half ;-) 
             reminded me of what great people work there which has inspired me 
             not to be lazy and take the drive into brooklyn to experience you 
             outstanding services. I say OUTSTANDING because when I went there, I 
             received nothing but that and am confident nothing has changed in 
             that domain.
                   <br/>
                   I am looking forward to returning to your salon. I wish you and 
             fiance all the best with the baby, and a very happy and healthy 2010 
             :-)

             Or is it the A+ stylings of their hair dressers? (I love the way I 
             look and feel by the time I leave this joint)
             ...I'm not going to decide. Will you?

             I had heard all the horror stories about PA, but had a gift 
             certificate, so I had no choice but to use it. I was "assigned" 
             jayne, and have been going to her ever since--about 3 years now. She 
             does my cuts, color and recently gave me highlights that I got a 
             million compliments on. She is always honest with me, telling me 
             when I need to take off more than my usual 1/2 inch and last spring 
             she gave me bangs to die for. I used the spa once for a Brazillian, 
             and it was just ok, hence the 4 star review. i have thought about 
             changing to a salon closer to my home, but I just can't take the 
             chance! Jayne is brilliant and so, so sweet!â

             I have recently had my hair colored by Don and styled by Mohammed. 
             These two gentlemen made my day when they put their professional 
             touch on my red-head trusses! Also a few weeks prior...I have 
             received an indulging facial from Bella whom I have been going to 
             for years. I felt so pampered and relaxed that I did not want to 
             wake up when the treatment was over. She also does the best waxing 
             services this side of down state New York! Give them a try...you'll 
             be pleased trust me! The front desk staff is also very friendly and 
             courteous!Â

                   WOW! I drove my wife to try another hair place. This time it was in 
 			Brooklyn. We are from Manhattan. I was not sure why she picked this 
 			place. But i soon found out.
                   <br/>
                   I dropped her off a looked for a parking spot on 3rd ave, which was 
 			not easy. Finally i walked into the salon and my wife had checked in 
 			with the front desk after waiting on a small line. Immediately were 
 			were wisked away to this most fabulous waiting area. Available was 
 			almost any refreshment or snack available. A gentle men walked in 
 			and asked where i parked and if i would need anybody to watch my 
 			meter. NICE! I don't know how they do it. The place was jammed and 
 			it was a Thursday. But everything was moving smoothly. They came for 
 			my wife and she began what she told me later was a dream salon come 
 			true. A while later a person came by and told me not to worry about 
 			my meter -it was taken of. The colorist came over soon later and 
 			told me her color was processing and she would be getting her 
 			haircut soon. About 45 min later another person told me my wife was 
 			almost finished and i could meet her in the front of the place. And 
 			sure enough she appeared and looked great. After she paid someone 
 			wisked her over to a makeup applier and got a complimentary makeup. 
 			Really nice people. I still cant figure out how they do it. 2 very 
 			attractive women, i think they were managers thanked us for coming. 
 			And said hope to see you again. They will.

                   I had my hair done by Dana. My curls were set by Mayor. Both were 
             very friendly &amp; conversed with me throughout. I was taken in right 
             away &amp; finished in decent time of 2 hours. They offer you a nice 
             selection of beverages &amp; have a coat check. All the stylists have 
             photo books of all of their own work which really helped know their 
             strengths &amp; therefore made choosing a style simpler. I had clip in 
             extensions put in &amp; they were really secured fantastically. Dana was 
             so helpful in trying &amp; playing around with different styles since I 
             didn't have a trial. My 2 dislikes: the curls were not set tight 
             enough in the extensions and fell out before the ceremony while my 
             actual hair stayed curly (didn't look bad but not what I wanted) &amp; 
             the price with tax was very high-$182 (not including tip).

             I was reffered to a hairdresser named Maria by my granddaughter. She 
             was so accomodating she actually came in from Staten Island on HER 
             DAY OFF to give me a haircut! She listened and did exactly what I 
             wanted! They gave me a complimentary conditioning treatment along 
             with a mini makeup application, done by Susan, also a very pleasant 
             woman! Besides the hairdresser and make up artist I was taken by the 
             front desk customer service! The owner made me a delicious capuccino 
             as well! OVERALL.. GREAT SERVICE! FRIENDLY PEOPLE! WONDERFUL 
             ATMOSPHRE TO BE IN! I WILL DEFFINATLY BE GOING BACK!

                   Worth 
             Every Penny!!! Felt Like a Vacation!!
             I was at pilo arts just yesterday getting services done. I decided 
             that I work too hard and it was time for a "Christina Day." Upon 
             entering, I was greeted with smiles of radiance and such great 
             courtesy. The assistant came to get me, and I was ready to be washed 
             and soon to look and feel fabulous in a matter of minutes. When I 
             sat in Mo's chair, he smiled and introduced himself and got straight 
             to the point of asking ME what it was that I wanted. I had brought a 
             cut out of the color and stlye I was looking for and he got to work. 
             Throughout my time in his chair, he interacted with me, making sure 
             that I was happy with the services. The color came out amazing, far 
             better then what I had expected it to be, as was the cut, which he 
             cut perfectly down to the last strand of hair. It was an overall 
             wonderful experience and I will surley be returning again.
                   <br/>

                   Pilo Arts is by far the best salon experience I have had in all of 
             the metro area. I have lived in Manhattan for 13 years and have 
             visited many top notch salons. Pilo blew me away. Their service was 
             exceptional, the price, compared to what I pay in manhattan, was 
             relatively inexpensive and I walked out feeling like a million 
             dollars. I now commute to Brooklyn every time I need my hair done, a 
             facial or massage. I have and would highly recommend Pilo Arts. 
             GREAT JOB keep it up.

             As a recent transplant to Brooklyn I was in need of somewhere to get 
             my hair permanently straightened - it was time to touch up the 
             Japanese hair straightening done to my unruly mess and I could not 
             find hardly anywhere in Brooklyn to do it. The few salons I talked 
             to were rude or snooty but the staff at Pilo was very friendly on 
             the phone. I spent about four hours with Tony today and left with 
             completely perfect straight hair. I can honestly say it was the best 
             job ANYONE has ever done using the Japanese straightening technique 
             on my hair. Tony was lovely, funny, and friendly and the staff at 
             Pilo was extremely nice. In six months when it's time for more 
             touchups you can bet I will go nowhere else but here. Highly 
             recommend!

             Stephanie is VERY TALENTED!...â
             I have been going to her for YEARS now and she is the best I have 
             seen as of yet! I am VERY picky and skeptical about how my hair 
             would look but just trust her and you will be absolutely pleased! 
             You have my word for it- no regrets! I travel from OH to NY to get 
             my hair cut and its well worth it! It may be pricey- "you get what 
             you pay for!" You don't even need anything in mind to suggest to her 
             she will make you walk out the salon with your head up high with 
             superior style!â

             in NYC before I became a baby popper. It is really hard for me to 
             trust anyone to cut my hair. I went to this salon, I loved it the 
             ambiance was nice. I had Athena cut my hair. She knows what she is 
             doing. If you could go in to Brooklyn, I definitely recommend this 
             place.

             first experience with Pilo Arts was...Â  because i recieved a gift certificate from a co-worker. I used the gift 
             certifercate and now i'm hooked. I've used a variety of their 
             services and have never been disappointed. Massages superb, 
             mani-pedi fantastic, cut and style fabulous, facils wonderful. The 
             service is incredible everyone is so so so nice. It's the prefect 
             place to kick back and relax. I love spending my saturdays there.

             I have heard excellent things about the Pilo Arts Salon &amp; Day Spa. I 
             have heard glowing reviews about their massages, haircuts and 
             manicures. Pilo Arts Salon &amp; Day Spa is pretty expensive, but 
             virtually every recommendation for them has been great. They offer 
             massages, nail care, hair coloring and cuts, waxing and other beauty 
             services. They have great packages for mother's day and other 
             holidays.

                     fabulous- my new favorite spot!Â 
             I had been meaning to get a facial for some time &amp; I am so glad I 
             finally did it! I have instantly become a regular customer. I don't 
             know what these other reviews are talking about- the entire front 
             desk staff was nothing but polite and helpful. I stopped in to make 
             an appointment during the 3rd Ave Festival and didn't know who to go 
             to. I couldn't have been happier with Yolanda- she is amazing and 
             couldn't be sweeter. I am a former hairstylist and worked in a spa 
             for years- I know how these places often work &amp; was expected an 
             attempt at an upsell but I never got one- not even for products (but 
             I bought lots of Dermalogica anyway!). I have absolutely nothing bad 
             to say about Pilo Arts. Go and relax and you will be happy.

                    Tania did a fabulous job on my hair and its not an easy cut either! 
             I've been going to the same hairstylist for years and was leery 
             about switching but Tania took her time with me-evaluated my face

                    I have been going to Don for my color and Tania for my hair for

                    Don Orlando Hair Colorist:
             I had been to another salon and they ruined my hair. It was Sunday 
             and i freaked. I was driving down 3rd av and saw someone walk out of 
             a Pilo Arts with great hair color. When i entered i knew i was in 
             good hands. i was greated by a handsome gent named Don. He eased my 
             pain by explaining exactly what needed to be done to correct my hair 
             catastrophe. When my hair was blown afterward i knew this is my new 
             salon 4 ever.

             Christmas. I had an entire day of beauty &amp; now feel like a million

                    an amazing place in brooklyn:
             I recently went to Pilo Arts to get some individual lashes applied, 
             the make-up artist Betsy asked me if I wanted to get an application 
             as well. I absolutly loved it and highly recommend betsy to all my 
             friends and family.

                    A Day of Beauty:
             I went to Pilo Arts because my sister gave me a gift certificate. It 
             was one of the best gifts I ever received because I got a fabulous 
             haircut. I was treated royally and I had a great afternoon. I felt 
             pampered. I will definitely come back for my future hair styling. I 
             highly recommend them.

                   Im so glad Pilo Arts is in MY neighborhood!:
             Pilo Arts is truly a diamond in the rough. Brooklyn has some decent 
             hair salons, but Pilo Arts is by far the best. Its beautiful from 
             the outside as well as inside. The services surpass any others I 
             have had. The staff is crazy friendly and willing to do anything to 
             keep you happy. I cant say enough about this little piece of 
             manhattan style and flare Salon. I would recommend Pilo Arts to 
             anyone anyday!

             refreshments. I love my results everytime, I always see Don for my

             everytime.

             I dont care what anybody says,I love Pilo Arts.On arrival I felt a 
             little intimidated ,but only by the decor of this exquisite salon 
             and beautiful girls that greet you when you get there.From start to 
             finish I was really pampered.My hair was a mess,havent been to a 
             salon in a while as I have toddlers at home.I met with my stylist 
             Sinead{a very down to earth irish girl},who made me feel very 
             comfortable.She transformed me,by starting with bringing me back to 
             my natural color,and a few highlights surrounding my face,she then 
             complimented the color with a fabulous cut to frame my face.She 
             understood I dont have a lot of time to style my hair everyday with 
             my kids so she showed me a very easy and fast way of styling my 
             hair.I really appreciated her dedication and patience with 
             me,looking forward to my next visit to Pilo.You guys are 
             great!!Maybe I will treat myself to a massage next time too!

                   She's the best, very honest, very helpful, amazing eye for color and

       friendly, great attitudes, excellent skill (and a great cup of 
       cappuccino!!!) I always feel taken care of at Pilo.

                   Best Salon In Brooklyn:Â 
             I had received a gift card from my best friend for my birthday and 
             it was the best experience of my life. I had a great hair cut with 
             Olympia, a soothing facial with Bella and a relaxing massage with 
             Jessica. From that point on, I have never even considered going to 
             another salon again. It was the beginning of a whole new world for 
             me and I don't think I'll ever want to look back again. I love Pilo 
             Arts!

                   Was very sceptical about changing my salon of 20 plus years, I felt 
       unconfortable but once I entered the salon and was greated and felt at 
       home. My recomendation was high but I had even higher expectations. For 
       the least they were fulfilled and then some, I changed my style of 20 
       years and my normal colour of 10 years to a new younger me and I LOVE IT. 
       Thank you Stefanie your new client Marie.

       have to try it!
       I just moved to Bay Ridge and I came accross Pilo Arts while eating at a 
       nearby restaurant. The beautiful girls at the front desk caught my eye and 
       I went in to ask about prices (I needed an excuse). I ended up getting my 
       hair cut that same night. Not only did I have a great time but I think I 
       got the best haircut ever. You have to try it! I highly recommend 
       it.......

       take them to get a haircut I prepare for the worst. But at Pilo Arts, The 
       staff was very accomodating to them and myself. Not to mention Patient. 
       Ivan Gave them both great haircuts and made them feel comfortable. I also 
       got a haircut and his assistant kept my boys entertained while i relaxed 
       for a bit. So if you got kids and need a day of haircuts, go to Pilo!

                   Creativity &amp; positive atmosphere.Â 
       Definitely not a typical Brooklyn Spa. It is more of an upscale European 
       Spa in its great tradition &amp; of the Greenwich Village style where genuine 
       friendliness, all welcome, artistically inclined with a touch of 
       imagination and freedom is felt.
                   <br/>
                   The uniques atmosphere of the holistic massage room is awesome and well 
       suited for those who need more than a typical accommodations: the water 
       fountain, crystals with prismatic light, and the surround sound with 
       ambient and light trance sounds of Europe put you literally in a trance. 
       Drinks are offered for free, private lockers, and a shower combined with a 
       steam infused with essential oils given complimentary after the Spa 
       treatments add the effect of forgetting the problems of everyday life and 
       entering a retreat for the calming of the mind and body. A unique place 
       slightly ahead of its time.

       I have found my favorite place to go when i feel stressed or unhappy. Its 
       Pilo Arts of course! Stefano is amazing and gives you exactly what you 
       want and gives fabulous blowouts! The front desk is so friendly and right 
       on top of things. I just recently went for a facial with Sara. My skin is 
       amazing and glowing thanks to her advice on how to take care of it. All i 
       have to say is Thank god for Pilo Arts!

       There is not just one thing that I can write about Pilos Arts because when 
       I came here for the first time on Saturday everything intrigued and amazed 
       me. From the greetings from the staff from the moment you walk in to all 
       of the fellow clients until you leave, you feel that everything was well 
       worth it. I was totally pampered at the spa with a facial w/ Sara and a 
       massage by Stuart and then I got fabulous new cut and color by Kim. Pilo 
       Arts keeps me feeling happy and young and I look forward to experiencing 
       more things with them.

       just needed a change so, i tryed Pilo Arts and to my surprise I was very

       pilo arts is by far the best spa in new york. i have been to MANY spas in 
       the area and this by far outweighs the competition. As soon as i entered 
       the spa i was greeted with smiles and proceeded to have the best massage 
       and facial i have ever had. The staff is very knowledgeable and pleasant. 
       At the end of my services, I was offered a complimentary paraffin hand 
       treatment and steam shower. I loved it so much i made a massage 
       appointment for my husband before i left. I am definitely recommending 
       pilo arts to everyone!

       I won a gift certificate to Pilo Arts from a radio station that I listen 
       to all the time. I came in for a full Day of Beauty and words alone cannot 
       describe my overall experience. Their Spa is beautiful and very peaceful, 
       their staff is friendly and kind, the place is beautiful and the services 
       are the best I've ever received. Not only did they make me look beautiful 
       but they made me feel welcomed from the moment I checked in. I will go 
       back for more......and I'm definitely putting Pilo Arts on Santa's list!Â

       I have been a client at Citysearch of Pilo Art's for more than 5 years and have never 
       been disappointed. From the moment i walk into the salon i feel like a 
       million dollars. The managers and front desk always greet me with 
       kindness. I know that the salon's top priority is customer service and you 
       can tell by the way each client is treated. Its a beautiful place to be in 
       and you are surrounded by beautiful people as well. Each time i get my 
       haircut from Stefani, i am always pleased and cant wait until i can get 
       another.

       I was recommended to Pilo Arts by a friend and I was blown away. Sara gave 
       me the most pampering four layer facial ever followed by the magical hands 
       of Jessica for a massage. Then the owner herself poured me a Mimosa and 
       gave me a wonderful tour of the rest of the Salon. I would highly 
       recommend Pilo Arts!!! AAA++++Â

       I highly recommend Pilo Arts to anybody who wants to experience a day 
       beauty and pleasure. First I would like to say that the Spa is beautiful 
       and the staff are very friendly. I just had my hair styled by Ivan an it 
       was the best hair cut I have ever received. My friends keep ranting and 
       raving about my new style and say that it makes me look younger. Thank you 
       Pilo!

       customer service that I received was unbelievable. I was in and out as 
       scheduled. They even opened a bottle of champagne and made mimosas for my 
       whole bridal party. I want to also thank the management and the bridal 
       coordinator for being so accommodating and helping make my day even that 
       more special. I will make sure to send you a picture as soon as I get 
       them!!!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

       is so much more. I rec. Sara or Bella for a facial and Mariola for a 
       waxing. You won't be disappointed.

                   Best 
       Birthday Ever.Â 
       It was my birthday recently, and my family had surprised me with a gift 
       certificate for a one hour facial and massage from Pilo Arts. I knew 
       immediately that I needed to call up as soon as possible since it is one 
       of the most popular salons in Brooklyn and the appointments fill up really 
       quickly there. When I called up later on that day, one of the lovely 
       receptionists had answered the phone and helped me schedule an appointment 
       for that weekend, which was exactly what I needed. And, from that point 
       on, I became even more amazed. The massage with Jessica and the facial 
       with Bella were wonderful including the relaxing steam shower that I took 
       after all of my services. I felt like the most important birthday girl 
       ever!

             I was refer to Pilo Arts by a friend and I am so happy I took her 
             advice. I went in for my color and haircut and received a complete 
             makeover. My highlights are unbelievable, they look sooo natural, 
             and my cut is absolutely great! I loved their atmosphere! The best 
             part is that the next day I received a phone call to see how my 
             services were....Now, that's customer service!!! I want to thank

                   Melt like butter:
             I recently received a gift certificate for a massage at Pilo Arts in 
             Bay Ridge. I was told to see Stuart. I wasn't comfortable with a man 
             therapist at first, but he was very professional while he worked. If 
             you are overworked or simply like to pamper yourself, Stuart's your 
             man. The spa is clean, the atmosphere comfortable, the steam shower 
             awesome. My advice would be to get there early to sip on a 
             complimentary mimosa or cappacino.

       Picture Perfect Day!Â 
       When I woke up on my wedding day to see it cold and rainy, it didn't start 
       out the way I planned. When I got to Pilo Arts, I was greeted with a warm 
       and hospitable staff. I sat in the chair of their make-up artist, Suzanne, 
       who came highly recommended. My make-up looked natural, yet elegant. I 
       received my proofs, and I must say, I looked like a princess! Thank you 
       Pilo Arts!

                   And I must say she ended my beauty time perfectly. Her calm nature kept me 
       even toned and she worked very swiftly and professionally. I was so glad 
       that my day had turned around and I have to thank Pilo Arts for that!

       I recently experienced the best 
       treatment at Pilo Arts in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. I used a hairdresser named 
       Jaymie. She gave me a great cut and treated me wonderfully. The atmosphere 
       is great. I would highly recommend this salon. They really know how to 
       make you feel special.

                    Beautiful prom night.Â 
       I took my little sister to Pilo Arts to get her hair and make-up done. It 
       was my present to her. Ivan did her hair and Ilene did her make-up. She 
       had never looked so beautiful before. She loved it and so did all her 
       friends...not to mention her date! I can't wait until I have a special 
       event to go to so I can do my hair and make-up done there also! I highly 
       recommend Pilo Arts, especially if you have a special night planned!

                     The best of the best without the trip to 
             manhattan:
             I visited your salon to have my color corrected from a mistake made 
             by one of your competators. I was directed to see Riccardo by a 
             wonderful young lady from the front desk. Her name was Melissa.I 
             wanted to be brought back, as close as I could, to my natural color. 
             Riccardo talked with me for quite some time before he formulated my 
             color. I was served champagne and made to feel comfortable. The 
             atmosphere in the color department was friendly and professional. 
             After lightening my hair and putting some final low-lites, Riccardo 
             made me feel and look like my old self. It was my daughters wedding 
             the next weekend. My daughter and my husband both couldn't get over 
             the rejuvination of my hair. He is definatly a five star colorist. 
             Thanks to Riccardo, I felt as pretty as the bride. The only 
             complaint I might have is the parking conditions are not so great 
             due to all the business in the area. Great restaurants. Thanking you 
             again, Claudia Piazza

       I recently visited Pilo Arts for the first time and it was well worth the

       the time I left. Let me not forget the most important thing I finally 
       found someone who listened and knew how to handle my hair. I will be back 
       in a few weeks for my highlights and some more cappuccino.

       Magnificant.Â 
       Pilo Arts Day Spa and Salon is magnificent and promotes beauty and 
       excellence. As I arrived, the doors of Pilo open and the pampering begins 
       as the receptionist welcomed me into their home with coffee, tea, or wine. 
       The atmosphere is awesome because it is a calm and stress free environment 
       which caters to the needs of their clients. I have received many services 
       at Pilo such as haircuts with the artistic team, color with the color 
       department, and facials and massages after a hard and long day at work. 
       Pilo keeps me coming back for more because I want to see and experience 
       everything the salon has to offer. I look forward for that weekly reminder 
       to confirm my appointment because I will soon have the pleasure of 
       returning to Pilo. I highly recommend Pilo Arts Day Spa and Salon because 
       the staff is talented, knowledgeable, and professional.

                    The best hair color: 
             I recently went to Pilo Arts and i was totally impressed. The people 
             were professional and courteous. I went to Kim for my color and cut 
             and i never loved anyhting more. I will definitly be going back to 
             Pilo!!

             HEAVEN !!!Â 
       Having a bad day, I was walking home from a long train ride.....never 
       having went into Pilo Arts because I finally went in. Just walking into 
       the salon my day turned around. The friendly and accommodating Front desk 
       receptionist offered me everything to make me feel at home. I was given a 
       cappuccino, had my coat check and seated in a special waiting area. Boy 
       did I feel like Queen!! Even though the salon seemed to be very busy, the 
       manager personally came to greeted me. One haircut turned to color, 
       highlights, make up, eyebrow threading, &amp; my nails done. Each department 
       not only did a wonderful job but educated me with tips of how to keep up 
       my new look. I was so impressed with all the talent that I found in one 
       place. I think you too should give this salon a chance to make you 
       beautiful.

       I have been going to Pilo Arts since I was 11 years old. Now that I am 25, 
       I am in awe of how consistent the service is. Whenever I step foot into 
       this wonderful salon, I am treated like loyalty. I cannot think of a time 
       when I wasn't treated like a queen. The staff is extremely friendly and 
       courteous. They are also very talented in their craft. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
       this salon to ANYONE!!

             I had the most enjoyable Sunday afternoon in Pilo Arts. I love it in 
             there. From the massage I got with Leo, the facial with Mariola and 
             the incredible haircut I got from Donna I didnt want to go home. On 
             your next day off walk into Pilo Arts and ask one of the lovely 
             receptionist to book you a Day of Beauty and let your stress melt 
             away. Leave the rest up to them...Trust me you will not regret it.

                    The Perfect Salon:Â 
             Pilo Arts is by far the best day spa and salon I have ever been to. 
             From the excellent massages to the perfect haircut I receieve every 
             time I visit, this salon is one that everyone should give a try. I 
             used to hate my hair before I got a life changing haircut from my 
             stylist Nicholas. I have to say, he is brilliant!! I looked like a 
             superstar. This is the #1 salon in Brooklyn.

             On my first visit to Pilo Arts I was wondering whether I would 
             regret coming to the salon or whether it would be a great 
             experience. My curiousity was confirmed - I had one of the most 
             soothing and relaxing days that I hadnt had for years. I had an 
             amazing day of pampering, including a wonderful massage that I never 
             failed to remember when I had a stressful and tiring day.The 
             outstanding services that I received at Pilo Arts has made me a 
             faithful client for years.

       I have to say that my day at Pilo Arts was absolutely fantastic. My 
       girlfriend and I had a full Day of Beauty and I have never felt more 
       refreshed and brand new in my life! After all my stressful hours at work, 
       my massage and facial felt so relaxing and invigorating. My very handsome 
       hair stylist Nicholas was amazing, and left me feeling like a movie star. 
       My hair looked beautiful and healthy and the color was marvelous. He did a 
       fantastic job. The staff did its best to make me feel at home and everyone 
       who hasn't visited this salon should definitely give it a try. You won't 
       be disappointed.

       be satisfied.Â 
       Pilo Arts is one of the best, if not the best, hair salons in the 
       Tri-State area. Paul Pastore, the owner of Polio, has been cutting my hair 
       for several years now and I've never left unhappy with my new cut. The 
       staff is friendly and polite. I've recommended Pilo to several people and 
       there has never been any negative feedback from their visit. Some people 
       may say parking is tough, but where isn't parking tough in Brooklyn. The 
       next time you need a hair cut for a special occasion or its just time for 
       a haircut, I'd call Pilo and make an appointment because you wont be 
       disappointed. And while you there, get your nails or make-up done and 
       maybe enjoy a relaxing massage.

                   Bad 
       hair day.Â 
       I came to New York from my hometown in Pennsylvania. I never knew how 
       horrible my hair actually was until I noticed all the stares I received 
       from people that walked by me. I asked a coworker, who always had fabulous 
       hair, where she went to get her hair done. She recommended Pilo to me, and 
       I decided to check it out online as well. It received great reviews and I 
       figured what more was there to lose. So I went in for a consultation and 
       met with Don for color and Ivan for a cut. I decided to book the 
       appointment then and there. Lets just say my orange coif is no more. I now 
       have healthy, radiant hair. Watch out New York because here I come. Right 
       off of a Pantine ad! A+

       I was getting ready for a date on Friday night. I couldn't figure out how 
       I should apply makeup to my face or what to do with my hair. I called Pilo 
       hoping they would have an appointment available and they did. I had my 
       hair blown out by Olympia and my makeup applied by Ilene. I must tell you 
       I looked like a million dollars. Well, my first date has turned out to be 
       a serious relationship. We're talking marriage here, and Ilene and Olympia 
       did an outstanding job. I would definitely recommend them if you're trying 
       to make a good, long lasting impression.

       Pilo arts is the best hair salon in NYC. I felt so welcomed on arrival, had 
       a glass of wine from the manager right away, just what I needed after a 
       long working day!I was pampered from start to finish. I Had exceptional 
       color and cut done by one of your fine talented master stylists .Very 
       impressed as a whole. I gave them my email address and now I will be 
       receiving discounts too!I find them so reasonable for the quality of work 
       that they do, I've been to all the upscale trendy spots in the city and this 
       is by far much better! Looking forward to my next visit.

                   TOTAL BLISS AT PILO ARTS!!Â  My experience at Pilo Arts was 
 			quite extraordinary. I received a DAY OF BEAUTY gift card from my 
 			boyfriend for my birthday which was AMAZING!! I was able to 
 			experience every aspect of the salon &amp; spa--it included a massage, 
 			facial, LUNCH, nails, hair, make-up...you name it-I got it. The 
 			staff is very friendly and seems to be very experienced. I will 
 			TOTALLY return there for future appts and recommend everyone I know 
 			to go &amp; experience what I did. what a great place to pamper 
 			yourself!!

       I went to Pilo after trying different salons in Brooklyn. After many 
       botched attempts, I found my salvation in Nicholas. He gave me a new look 
       and made me feel ten years younger. I even had the courage to ask one of 
       the girls at the front desk out. I felt my self-esteem rise again. Thanks 
       a lot Pilo, and Nicholas keep up the good work!

                   Absolutely Outstanding Service:
             There was nothing I disliked about the time I spent in Pilo. It was 
             well worth the money to get completely pampered for a day, 
             especially since it relieves the stress that comes with being a 
             single mom. I recommend this salon above all others in the Brooklyn 
             area. Absolutely Outstanding.

       view of Pilo Arts.Â 
       Came to your salon for a couple of services. Had a back wax by Yolanda 
       which was totally painless. Went upstairs to see Riccardo for some Low 
       Lites which brought me back twenty years. I had a haircut by Tonia. While I 
       was in her chair she made me feel like I was the only one in the salon. 
       The services I received were above and beyond any Manhattan salon. The 
       prices are somewhat reasonable and parking is fair but worth the wait. I 
       finally found a full service salon to take care of all my needs. I was made 
       to feel like a King. My appointment was on a weekend and the salon was 
       packed but everything ran on time . They gave me the best customer service 
       I have ever received, especially with the crowd they service.

       addiction!!!Â 
       I have to say that I am addicted to Pilo Arts. From its incredibly 
       talented staff, to its exceptional customer service, a visit to the salon 
       is like a mini vacation. Even if I'm just coming in for a blow out I get 
       treated like a princess. I have recommended Pilo Arts to all of my family 
       and friends and highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet. I 
       work in Manhattan and had the opportunity to visit other well known 
       salons, but nothing ever compared to the overall experience that I always 
       have at Pilo Arts, and the prices make it even that much better!!!! Try 
       it, you'll see what I mean.

       Last week I had the pleasure to spend some time at your salon. This was my 
       first time there and it was one of the most delightful experiences of my 
       life. For a salon to employee so many talented people and still be able to 
       give you that one on one experience. You have a colorist there named 
       Riccardo. He greeted me when I arrived and we had a consultation . He made 
       me feel as if he knew me my whole life. He was very knowledgeable about his 
       work. His over all appearance and personality made me feel as though I was 
       in a Manhattan . My hi-lites were fantastic. The over all treatment at 
       your 
       salon was A+. From your front desk, to the assistants and right through 
       to your color department. Riccardo catered to my every need. I would 
       highly recommend Riccardo and Pilo Arts to anyone.

             This was my first time at Pilo Arts after hearing many wonderful 
             things about it. I had a massage and a facial. Apon arrival I was 
             offered a drink and waited in a lovely waiting room with beautiful 
             furniture and listened to soft music. I then was led to a room to 
             change. During the massage and facial I was throurghly cared for, 
             felt constantly relaxed. The massage left me completely relaxed and 
             floating on cloads. Jessica was amazing and worked out every ache in 
             my muscles. I then took a steam shower that I never wanted to leave. 
             I would highly recommend Pilo Arts to anyone, and can't wait to go 
             back for more.

                    a 
       little bit of heaven.Â 
       I cant begin to tell you the great experience my girlfriends and i had at 
       Pilo Arts. We traveled from Manhattan and from the moment we entered the 
       pampering started. We were whisked away to to our stylists with champagne 
       in hand. I started in the Spa with a facial from Bella. It was very quiet 
       and soothing in the spa. Then i went upstairs to the color dept. Don gave 
       me the most beautiful and natural hilites i ever received. After a 
       massaging shampoo that lasted about 15 minutes i moved along to Tony for a 
       fantastic haircut. We actually all walked out happy as can be.

             All I can say is Service, Service, Service! Pilo Arts truly 
             appreciates their customers. What can you expect? Excellent service 
             without attitude or insane prices - a rare thing in this city. Ivan 
             gave me the best haircut of my life and everyone at Pilo Arts waited 
             on me hand and foot. So, if you want to feel like a total princess, 
             RUN to Pilo Arts. Pilo Arts is well worth the trip to Brooklyn (and 
             you get a nice view of the Verrazzano Bridge).

       Every experience at Pilo is always wonderful. The front desk is always 
       inviting. The managers are always extremely accommodating. The styling is 
       exceptional. The spa relaxing. Pilo's make-up artists always provide 
       services which enhance my natural beauty....The list goes on.... I usually 
       go weekly for a blow out.. When my usual stylist isn't available, the 
       receptionists refer me to someone else, and am always satisfied. Never one 
       bad experience. Highly recommended.

             I have heard excellent things about the Pilo Arts Salon &amp; Day Spa. I 
             have heard glowing reviews about their massages, haircuts and 
             manicures. Pilo Arts Salon &amp; Day Spa is pretty expensive, but 
             virtually every recommendation for them has been great. They offer 
             massages, nail care, hair coloring and cuts, waxing and other beauty 
             services. They have great packages for mother's day and other 
             holidays.

             I just want to say that I was very impressed with the staff and 
             overall services offered at Pilo Arts Day Spa &amp; Salon. The customer 
             service rivals the best day spas in the country, a rarity for New 
             York City. I had the four layer facial with Bella and la stone 
             therapy with stewart, and for the two hours that I spent in the spa, 
             I was in total bliss. I then received a hair cut with Paul, who 
             happens to be a member of Intercoiffure. The cut was incredible. I 
             definitely going to return.
