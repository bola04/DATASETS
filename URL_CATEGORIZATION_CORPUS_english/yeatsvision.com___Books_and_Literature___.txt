          This web site is dedicated to the work of the Irish poet W. B. Yeats (1865-1939), specifically to the strange, esoteric system which he and his wife, George, created, and which he expounded in
          <i>
           A Vision
          </i>
          .  It is intended primarily for students of this work, and also for those who are interested in the intellectual and symbolic background to his later poetry and prose.  For those who are unfamiliar with Yeats or with
          <i>
           A Vision
          </i>
          , the
          <a href="/Overview.html">

          offers a brief introductory survey.

         <p>
          The System of Yeatss
          <i>
           A Vision
          </i>
          lends itself to hypertext, and to the use of visual material and dynamic diagrams which it enables, since the organisation of the material is notoriously difficult in both editions of
          <i>
           A Vision
          </i>
          (the A version of 1925 and the B version of 1937: see
          <a href="/Versions.html">
           The Two Editions
          </a>
          ).  This can leave many readers frustrated by the use of terms which are poorly explained or explained elsewhere and by the lack of easy cross-referencing, areas which hypertext addresses very effectively.
         </p>
         <p>
          In large part, however, the difficulty still remains, since: A symbol system can only be understood and evaluated by entering its web of internal relationships and noting how and where external criteria impinge on it.  The problem is that we cannot start with the complex whole all at once; and if we start at any one point, we immediately introduce distortions (

           <i>
            The Construction of Reality
           </i>
          </a>
          ).  While hypertext links enable a more fluid approach, the individual reader still has to approach the material in some form of sequence.  The topics on the main
          <a href="/Yeats.html">
           contents page
          </a>
          are therefore arranged in a rough order of ascending development, from the fundamentals of the System to their effect upon Yeatss vision of reality.

       The pages here do attempt to offer a clear and helpful guide to the ideas of
       <i>
        A Vision
       </i>
       and, in doing so, they sometimes extend and develop the material beyond what is explicitly contained in
       <i>
        A Vision
       </i>
       ; some of the diagrams in particular represent significantly different reformulations of those created by the Yeatses.

       The site does not aim to present a sustained argument either, although much of the material is associated with a doctoral thesis I presented at Oxford University and which I am preparing for book publication with a provisional title of
       <i>
        Yeats's

       if you are interested in an electronic copy of the thesis.  Inevitably, some complex themes have been simplified somewhat to make them more appropriate for this type of presentation, and much that is discussed in the book has been omitted, while there is more explanatory and descriptive treatment here.  The majority of sources are noted, but the scholarly apparatus has also been abbreviated.

       <b>
        <a href="http://yeatsvision.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">
         blog
        </a>
       </b>
       which explores aspects of
       <i>
        A Vision
       </i>
       and the Yeatses' System that do not fall within the more scholarly and factual ambit of this website. It examines elements of the system that interest me, particularly looking at parallels and how the System fits with esoteric and symbolic systems more generally. Whereas the website aims to offer clear and direct interpretation of
       <i>
        A Vision
       </i>
       for readers and students, confining itself largely to what Yeats himself wrote and to the academic study of his work, the comments and articles in the blog will be rather more speculative, exploratory and possibly personal. I add to the blog very slowly, and as it is far from topical and will only be minimally sequential, I hope that readers will feel able and welcome to respond to any post, whether it was nominally put up the day before or months or even years before. The blog is currently titled
       <a href="http://yeatsvision.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">
        <b>
         The Widening Gyre
        </b>
       </a>
       , even though that title has already been used quite a lot and I'm thinking about better alternatives, but the actual address is tied to this one:
