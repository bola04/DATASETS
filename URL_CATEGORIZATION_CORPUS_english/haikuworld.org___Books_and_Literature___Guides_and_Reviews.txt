           November 1, 2010 -- INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN SNAIL-MAIL NENGAJYOU NEW YEAR'S HAIKU CARD EXCHANGE
           <p>
            Several years ago, Pardee Gunter introduced to the Shiki BBS list the
 concept of a New Year's (snail mail) haiku card exchange, and those
 who participated found it a very rewarding experience.  In 2006,
 Roberta Beary suggested we renew that opportunity. A number of folks
 signed up to participate, and it was great fun. Even more signed up to
 participate each year since.
           </p>
           <p>
            This year Jennie Townsend will collect the snail mail addresses and provide a list to
 all participants. PLEASE NOTE: Because it can easily cost $100 or more
 just in postage to send cards to all participants, she may create
 smaller lists of 15-20 or so for those who cannot afford to send cards
 to the whole list, but the whole list will be made available to anyone
 who requests it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's some background:  The tradition in Japan around the new year is
 to send a New Year's greeting card called a
            <i>
             Nengajyou
            </i>
            (or nengajo) to
 friends, family, and acquaintances. The post office in Japan is
 prepared for this and actually saves these cards to ensure delivery on
 January 1. Many design their own cards with winter scenes or stamps.
 The design typically includes the
            <i>
             jyunishi
            </i>
            (zodiac sign). 2011 is the
 Year of The Rabbit. Somewhere on the card appear the words
            <i>
             Akemashite
 Omedetou Gozaimasu
            </i>
            (Happy New Year).
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who are interested in participating in this snail mail
 exchange, please send Jennie -- OFFLIST PLEASE at
            <a href="mailto:townsend56ster@gmail.com">
             townsend56ster@gmail.com
            </a>
            -- your snail mail address no later than December 1. She will compile
 an address list of all participants and send it to everyone who signs
 up (that list will be sent no later than December 3).
           </p>
           <p>
            When you get your list of participants' snail mail addresses, design a
            <i>
             Nengajyou
            </i>
            card along the lines suggested above  and include your
 original haiku with a New Year's theme.  Then snail-mail one card to
 each person on the list so that the card will arrive by January 1. The
 card can be as simple as your haiku and a message on a postcard
 (handmade or purchased), or a more elaborate (handcrafted or
 purchased) card with your New Year's haiku within an envelope.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please put
            <i>
             Nengajyou
            </i>
            in the subject line of your e-mail when you
 send your address. And please indicate whether you want to receive
 one of the small lists or the whole one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, please send your address OFFLIST to:

            his blog

            introduced with some thoughts about Bill
           </a>

            A Sense of the Genre, A Sense of the Language
           </a>
           .  Penny, our thoughts and prayers are with you.  Thank you for sharing Bill with us for all these many years and the support you gave him in his artistry.

             The Haiku Poetry of Issa
            </a>
            - David Lanoue knows more about Issa than any English speaker of which I am aware.  This site has over 4,000 Issa haiku!  Dr. Lanoue has also been very helpful to me in finding Issa poems and helping with translations.
