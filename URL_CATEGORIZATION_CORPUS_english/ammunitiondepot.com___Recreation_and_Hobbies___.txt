Both the case and the projectile are shortened to make the overall length of the round over 4mms shorter than a 9mm. A shorter round means you can build an overall smaller gun. The 380 ACP’s diminutive size isn’t indicative of it’s potential as a self-defense cartridge. Companies like Federal and Hornady produce top quality defensive .380 ammo that’s nothing to laugh at.

   380 ACP Ammo History  
  380 ACP   ammo   was designed by legendary arms and ammunition designer John Moses Browning in 1908. The ACP in .380 ammo ACP stands for Automatic Colt Pistol, as it was designed for the Colt Pocket Hammerless. 380 ACP is known by a few names, like 380, 9mm Short, and 380 Kurz.  
  The   design of the   380 ACP ammo allows it to be used in small, blowback operated pistols. Blowback operated guns tend to be reliable, cheaper to produce and they allow the barrel to be fixed for greater accuracy. 
  The .380 ACP ammo cartridge was fairly popular until the end of World War 2. After World War 2 service handguns trended towards 9mm and 45 ACP. The 380 ACP was used for popular smaller handguns like James Bond’s Walther PPK. 
  The 380 ACP has had one of the largest comebacks in ammunition history. At one point 380 ACP was almost a niche round and then concealed carry exploded. People wanted smaller and smaller guns and the 380 ACP was the perfect round for any these new pocket pistols. The little round was designed for guns that utilized a blowback design, and lacked a barrel locking mechanism. 
  380 ACP ammo gained enough steam that there are presently tons of defensive options available for it. The 380 ACP is a good choice for concealed carry or in a backup gun due to the small size of the guns, and the potency of the 380 ACP.">

It served as the primary cartridge for police revolvers until to the 1990s when automatics became the preferred police issue handgun. To this today the 38 Special revolver remains popular for concealed carry due to their moderate recoil and small size. The 38 Special began life as a black powder round, but as smokeless powder became popular manufacturers adopted guns and ammo to suit.

   The 40 Smith and Wesson or, 40 S&amp;W for short, is the most popular modern duty round in the United States. It was adopted by local, state, and Federal police forces shortly after it was introduced. The 40 S&amp;W was designed with the idea of replacing the 10mm round. It utilized the same 10mm projectile, but the shortened case made handgun grips smaller and easier to handle. The .40 S&amp;W soon found massive acceptance due to the advantages it offered.  
   The 40 S&amp;W offered a bit of a compromise between the power of a 45 ACP, and the capacity of a 9mm. At the same time, it brings numerous advantages to the table. 40 S&amp;W offers both supersonic and subsonic loads to shooters, with any 180 grain round being subsonic. 40 S&amp;W offers superior ballistics for barrier penetration compared to similar automatic cartridges.  
   With so many amazing options to choose from choosing a 40 S&amp;W load can be a challenge. At Ammunition Depot we can at least help you by limiting the selection to only high-quality bulk 40 S&amp;W ammo.

This would give users a higher capacity with an increase in power over other automatic pistol cartridges. The .357 SIG uses a 40 S&amp;W case to keep the grip of the weapon compact and comfortable. The case is necked down to accept a 9mm projectile.  
   357 SIG ammo is exceptionally fast and powerful. It’s a top performer when it comes to penetration and expansion. It’s been adopted by a number of Federal and State Agencies like the Secret Service, the Texas Rangers, the Federal Air Marshals, and the Virginia State Police.

   The great thing about America is someone can look at something like the 45 Colt and decided they want something even bigger. That’s what Dick Casull and Jack Fullmer must’ve decided when they took the task of building a bigger 45 caliber cartridge for revolvers. The 454 Casull was born in 1957 and lived as a wildcat cartridge up until 1998 when SAAMI finally published a set of standards for it. The 454 Casull is a powerhouse of a round. It’s capable of tossing a 300 grain projectile at over 1,600 feet per second.  
   This makes the round perfect for hunting medium to large North American game. It’s also one of the better and more controllable choices for self-defense against wild game up to bears. The 454 Casull is a flat shooting round that retains an impressive amount of velocity out to 100 yards when fired from a revolver.  
   The 454 Casull round can typically be tough to find, but at Ammunition Depot our in-stock guarantee is there to ensure you always have premium options for bulk 454 Casull.

  5.56 NATO ammo and 223 ammo (Remington) are brothers who share the same Mother. 223 ammo is the older brother and was designed in 1962 by Remington Arms. The round was being specifically designed for the military and their desire for a lightweight combat rifle. The round would eventually evolve and become the 5.56 x 45mm NATO. This round was adopted in the 1970s and became and remains the standard NATO round. 
   The 223 Remington was designed in 1962 for civilian shooters looking for a lightweight and easy shooting sporting round. A mere two years after its inception it was adapted for use by the United States military with their brand new M16 rifle. The round would later go on to be modified and adopted by NATO as the 5.56x45mm NATO round. While the rounds are largely interchangeable, it is unsafe to fire 5.56 rounds in rifles only designed for 223 due to high pressures. However, rifles chambered in 5.56 can shoot 223 ammo safely.  
   Both 5.56 and 233 ammo look and function identically. The difference comes in the pressure the rounds create and function with. 223 ammo feels most of its pressure in the center of the case. 5.56 ammo feels pressure near the throat. This is important for specific weapons since weapons chambered in 5.56 can fire both 5.56 and 223 REM. Weapons chambered in 223 REM should only fire 223 REM to maintain consistent function.  
   As for performance, 5.56 NATO and 223 ammunition are similar with the 5.56 often having a higher overall velocity. The 223 Remington was designed with sportsman and target shooters in mind. The 223 Remington is an excellent choice for hunters when the proper ammo is chosen. The 223 Rem round is great for small game and pests, as well as predators like coyote, and can even take medium sized game like deer and even small pig species. The 223 Rem is also an excellent home defense round with the proper projectile.  
   The 5.56 NATO ‘s higher pressure and military background typically makes it a better choice for duty, tactical, and home defense use. 5.56 NATO offers higher velocities and often better penetration against barriers.

   The 7.62x51 started life as an American military cartridge and eventually became one of America’s favorite hunting rounds, the 308 Winchester. The 7.62 NATO was developed in the Postwar United States and was designed to be the main fighting round in the United States military. Both rifles like the M14 and machine guns like the M60 chambered the round. The 7.62 round became standardized by NATO and the 308 Win became the favorite of hunters around the world.  
   308 ammo is typically loaded to a higher pressure than 7.62x51 NATO. When choosing which to buy it's best to refer to the proof marks on your rifle’s barrel, or your gun’s manual.

   The 7.62x39 ammo is one of the most successful intermediate rifle rounds ever created. The round has been serving around the world since 1944. It was created in response to the Second World War. The Russians observed most fighting taking place under 300 meters where lighter and shorter weapons had significant advantages. It's often called AK 47 ammo since it famously served in the most widely produced rifles in the world, the AK 47. However, it’s also used in rifles like the SKS, the SIG Sauer 556R, the CZ 527, and dozens of other rifles.  
   The 7.62x39 ammo is common and affordable. We offer you the option of buying by the box, or investing in bulk 7.62x39 ammo to save a little money long term.

   There have been few revolutions in ammunition like the 5.7x28mm. This odd round defies most expectations and even most titles. 5.7x28 ammo walks the line between a rifle and pistol round. It was designed to function in both long guns and handguns and was to fulfill a NATO replacement contract for the 9mm round. It delivered superior performance from both a handgun and long gun when compared to a 9mm round. The smaller diameter round allows a greater magazine capacity.  
   While NATO chugged along with the 9mm cartridge the 5.7 x 28 proved to be a popular round in both handguns and rifles. In a handgun its reaches over 1,600 feet per second, and with a rifle you are looking at speeds in excess of 2,000 fps. What’s important to keep in mind is how lightweight and light recoiling this round is while achieving that performance. The round is flat shooting, accurate, and suitable for small game hunting at close range.  
   If you are looking to stock up on bulk 5.7x28 you have come to the right place. We offer competitive pricing, and we are proud of our customer service.

   The 30-06 is an American rifle round designed over a hundred years ago. The round’s name is pronounced thirty-ought-six and it’s a unique designation for what at the time was a unique round. The thirty comes from the .30 caliber projectile the round is topped with and the ought-six comes from the fact the round was invented in 1906. The round would go on to inspire most western 30 caliber rounds, and as a round was a massive success. 30-06 served during both World Wars, as well as Korea, and into the early years of Vietnam.  
   These days 30-06 ammo is the choice of mostly American hunters and historical competition shooters. The 30-06 is a shoulder thumping, powerhouse of a round that can send a 180 grain projectile downrange at 2,700 feet per second. It’s accurate and hard hitting and capable of taking animals as big as elk and moose.  
   We offer 30-06 ammo in varying loads, some for hunting, and others for those classic military rifles.

   300 Blackout is one of the newest rounds on the commercial market. The 300 Blackout round was designed by suppressor company AAC and was intended for AR 15 platforms. The 300 Blackout round was designed to reach max velocity from a barrel as short as 9 inches, making it possible to produce short and effective rifles chambered in the cartridge. Additionally, the 300 Blackout could utilize both supersonic and subsonic rounds reliably. 300 Blackout ammo can weigh anywhere from 123 grains to 220 grains.  
   The subsonic rounds are perfect for shooters running a suppressor who want a silent and reliable semi-automatic rifle. Additionally, 300 Blackout ammunition utilizes 223 Remington cases as its parent case. The overall length of the rounds is identical to standard 223/556 ammunition and this allows AR owners the ability to convert their rifles with minimal changes. In fact, 300 Blackout is compatible with 5.56 magazines, BCGs, upper and lower receivers, buffers assemblies and more. The most notable difference between a 300 Blackout and 223 5.56 AR is going to be the barrel and gas system.  
   The 300 Blackout as a round has proven to be popular enough to find itself in a wide variety of rifles, including bolt actions and single shots.

   The 30-30 is a legendary American cartridge. It holds the title of being the first made in America small bore sporting rifle cartridge designed for smokeless powder. As you can assume, it’s an old round. It was born in 1895 and has since become an American hunting classic. It’s likely more deer have been taken with a 30-30 than any other round. It’s a round that just works.  
   30-30 ammo, pronounced thirty thirty, and is occasionally called 30 Winchester Centerfire, or 30 WCF. It’s a round designed for lever action guns, so it features a prominent rim much like a revolver cartridge. The first 30 stands for 30 caliber, and the second 30 stands for 30 grains of smokeless powder. This makes up the standard 30-30 load. The round was designed for hunting medium sized game like deer and hogs. In a lever gun it makes a nice brush cartridge for close range hunting. It’s moderate recoil and hard-hitting power, combined with the fast action of a lever gun makes it perfect stumbling across that unexpected buck.

   America really loves their 45 caliber projectiles. From the 45 Colt and 45 ACP to the 45-70 we tend to go with bigger is better. The 45-70 is a bit different because it was designed to be a rifle round. The 45-70 is an old round, it was designed in 1873 and is still going strong. Going strong in both its popularity and its power. The 45 in 45-70 stands for a 45 caliber projectile and 70 stands for the standard 70 grains of black powder used to propel the round. 45-70 is still in use by the military as a blank round that is used with line throwing guns aboard Naval vessels.  
   Modern 45-70 ammo is loaded differently these days, but are still just as powerful. The round itself is now even loaded to some extremely large revolvers for hunting and silhouette shooting. Modern 45-70 ammo is capable of taking any game on the North American continent and is an absolute shoulder slapper of a round.

Similar to .458 SOCOM, this unique cartridge was designed to meet the needs of individuals who needed to use AR15 style weapons but take down targets much more diligently than any 5.56x45 could hope to. Originally proposed by Col. Jeff Cooper as the "Thumper" concept, Cooper wanted a big game rifle chambered for something larger than a .44, was semi automatic, and that was capable of accuracy at 250 yards away.   In 2007, the .450 Bushmaster came to life with the  250-grain pointed SST Flex-Tip bullet, ready to take down any game that may come your way. '>

   The 458 Socom is a bore round initially designed for the AR 15. The idea behind the round was to provide the military with a powerful, fighting stopping round designed for use in close quarters combat. The idea came to be due to troops clearing caves in Afghanistan and their standard 5.56 rounds failing to quickly stop opposing forces. The big bore 458 Socom round nearly replicates the performance of the 45-70 Government, but is better suited for semi-auto actions.  
   The round was never adopted for military use, but found a home on the civilian market. 458 Socom ammo is naturally subsonic so it's easy to effectively suppress. It also hits some significant force and with the right hollow point load the wound cavity will be massive. This makes a solid hunting round for medium to large game. It's even a capable round for bear.  
   458 ammo even fits in a standard 30 round AR 15 magazine, but it limits the capacity to ten rounds due to the round’s size. We offer a variety of AR 15 magazines that are compatible with the 458 Socom, and you can check those out here. At Ammunition Depot we offer a wide selection of 458 Socom ammo for sale and match that with our low prices and you have an unbeatable combination.">

   The best design philosophies start with phrases like, “Bigger is better." That must have certainly been the case when John Browning designed the 50 BMG round. His initial idea was a scaled up 30-06 along with a scaled up machine gun to handle it. The 50 cal BMG was born to be an anti-vehicular and anti-air round and entered service in 1921. It’s been used in every conflict the U.S. Military engaged in since 1921 and is still a favorite anti-material round of the armed forces.  
   The round has been adopted by rifle shooters in a variety of semi-automatic, bolt action, and single shot rifle platforms. The 50 BMG is capable of reaching extreme ranges, making it a favorite of long range shooters. The 50 BMG is a massively powerful round, capable of throwing a 750-grain round at 2,820 feet per second and delivering over 13,000 foot pounds of energy. This massive amount of power is a challenge to control, but makes it possible to hit targets at beyond a mile.  
   Clubs like the Fifty Caliber Shooter’s Association hold matches across the country for 50 cal shooters to come and prove their mettle. If you are looking to feed the beast with some quality and accurate ammunition, we offer a selection of cheap 50 cal ammo that’s hard to beat at Ammunition Depot.'>

   The 6.5 Creedmoor, or 6.5 CM, is a rising star in the long range, short action rifle realm. It was produced in 2008 by Hornady and became an immediate favorite. 6.5 Creedmoor ammo utilizes a common bolt face that makes building a customized rifle very easy. The use of a 6.5 projectile gives the cartridge an excellent ballistic coefficient and 6.5 rounds tend to have a high sectional density.  
   The 6.5 Creedmoor can reach similar velocities and muzzle energies as the 300 Winchester Magnum. It does this with less overall recoil and in a short action rifle. The 6.5 Creedmoor has found acceptance with both competitive shooters and hunters. Hunters prefer the round due to its power and accuracy. Competition shooters love its consistency and its long-range accuracy. In fact, in the hands of professional shooters it can maintain a sub MOA group size out to 1,000 yards.  
   What’s your goal with the 6.5 Creedmoor? To take a whitetail at a few hundred yards, or to ring steel at 1,000 yards? Once you’ve answered that question check out Ammunition Depots selection of 6.5 Creedmoor ammo. We carry ammo for every occasion, and our competitive pricing is hard to beat.">

   The 6.8 Special Purpose Cartridge, or 6.8 SPC, is a modern round developed by Remington, the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, and the U.S. Special Operation Command. It was designed to provide longer range and more power than the 5.56 in an AR 15 platform. The round completed its goal, but was not adopted for military service. It found new life with hunters looking to use a rifle as light and handy as an AR 15, but in a more potent caliber for moderately large game.  
   The 6.8 SPC round is exceptionally accurate and an easy conversion on AR platforms. The round was also utilized in Ruger’s Mini 14 series and several bolt action rifle designs. Its moderate recoil made it excellent for follow up shots on wounded, or dangerous game. Companies like Hornady developed specialized hunting loads for the round and the round exploded in popularity among hunters for game ranging from white tailed deer to black bear.  
   The 6.8 SPC is an accurate and hard hitting round for hunters, sport shooters, and marksmen. At Ammunition Depot we offer cheap 6.8 SPC ammo for every type of shooter.

It’s still found in the deer stand, on the battlefield and in the hands of collectors worldwide. The 7.62x54r is a full powered rifle round that is still capable of performing with modern rifle cartridges.  
   7.62x54R ammo is one of the cheapest full powered rifle rounds on the market. It’s quite powerful and a 150 grain projectile can reach nearly 3,000 feet per second. The round itself is suited for hunting large deer species, hogs, and as our friends in Russian have proven it’s a bear stopper. The round’s popularity for hunting has resulted in some high-end hunting ammunition being produced that’s still priced surprisingly low.

   In 1962 Remington made two major introductions to their lineup and the rifle world in general. They introduced their now flagship rifle the Remington 700 and the 7mm Remington Magnum. Of course, the first Rem 700s were chambered in Remington’s new magnum caliber. The 7mm Rem Mag was an instant hit, and obtained a majority market share in long action magnum caliber quite quickly. The 7mm Rem Mag outperforms even the venerable 30-06 Springfield in performance and power.  
   7mm projectiles offer a better ballistic coefficient than 7.62 or 30 caliber projectiles. This means they go further and hit harder more accurately. This flat shooting round is perfect for shooting over long distances, and maintains its strength over longer distances. It makes an excellent round for hunting over fields and plains. It’s powerful enough to take any game in North America and accurate enough to be adopted by the U.S. Secret Service for counter sniper operations.

  380 ammo is occasionally known as 9mm short, or 9mm Kurz due to the fact it does utilize a 9mm projectile. Both the case and the projectile are shortened to make the overall length of the round over 4mms shorter than a 9mm. A shorter round means you can build an overall smaller gun. The 380 ACP’s diminutive size isn’t indicative of it’s potential as a self-defense cartridge. Companies like Federal and Hornady produce top quality defensive .380 ammo that’s nothing to laugh at.

   380 ACP Ammo History  
  380 ACP   ammo   was designed by legendary arms and ammunition designer John Moses Browning in 1908. The ACP in .380 ammo ACP stands for Automatic Colt Pistol, as it was designed for the Colt Pocket Hammerless. 380 ACP is known by a few names, like 380, 9mm Short, and 380 Kurz.  
  The   design of the   380 ACP ammo allows it to be used in small, blowback operated pistols. Blowback operated guns tend to be reliable, cheaper to produce and they allow the barrel to be fixed for greater accuracy. 
  The .380 ACP ammo cartridge was fairly popular until the end of World War 2. After World War 2 service handguns trended towards 9mm and 45 ACP. The 380 ACP was used for popular smaller handguns like James Bond’s Walther PPK. 
  The 380 ACP has had one of the largest comebacks in ammunition history. At one point 380 ACP was almost a niche round and then concealed carry exploded. People wanted smaller and smaller guns and the 380 ACP was the perfect round for any these new pocket pistols. The little round was designed for guns that utilized a blowback design, and lacked a barrel locking mechanism. 
  380 ACP ammo gained enough steam that there are presently tons of defensive options available for it. The 380 ACP is a good choice for concealed carry or in a backup gun due to the small size of the guns, and the potency of the 380 ACP.">

The handgun would eventually evolve into the M1911 and be chambered in the 45 ACP. The 45 ACP would go on to serve in both World Wars in a variety of different guns and continues to serve with the M1911 to this day. The .45 ACP is a powerful, big bore round that’s popular among American shooters. It’s one of the big three of defensive handgun calibers and has stood the test of time.

   The 38 Special has been the go to choice for small and large revolvers around the world for well over a hundred years. It served as the primary cartridge for police revolvers until to the 1990s when automatics became the preferred police issue handgun. To this today the 38 Special revolver remains popular for concealed carry due to their moderate recoil and small size. The 38 Special began life as a black powder round, but as smokeless powder became popular manufacturers adopted guns and ammo to suit.  
   The 38 Special was designed to be an improvement on the 38 Long Colt, which proved to be anemic in actual combat. The 38 Special grew and evolved with the times, with much of its evolution coming from the law enforcement community.

   The 40 Smith and Wesson or, 40 S&amp;W for short, is the most popular modern duty round in the United States. It was adopted by local, state, and Federal police forces shortly after it was introduced. The 40 S&amp;W was designed with the idea of replacing the 10mm round. It utilized the same 10mm projectile, but the shortened case made handgun grips smaller and easier to handle. The .40 S&amp;W soon found massive acceptance due to the advantages it offered.  
   The 40 S&amp;W offered a bit of a compromise between the power of a 45 ACP, and the capacity of a 9mm. At the same time, it brings numerous advantages to the table. 40 S&amp;W offers both supersonic and subsonic loads to shooters, with any 180 grain round being subsonic. 40 S&amp;W offers superior ballistics for barrier penetration compared to similar automatic cartridges.  
   With so many amazing options to choose from choosing a 40 S&amp;W load can be a challenge. At Ammunition Depot we can at least help you by limiting the selection to only high-quality bulk 40 S&amp;W ammo.

   357 SIG is a very modern and relatively young round that came to be in 1994. The round was designed by famed pistol and rifle manufacturer SIG Sauer. The idea behind the round was to duplicate the power and velocity of the 357 Magnum in an automatic handgun. This would give users a higher capacity with an increase in power over other automatic pistol cartridges. The .357 SIG uses a 40 S&amp;W case to keep the grip of the weapon compact and comfortable. The case is necked down to accept a 9mm projectile.  
   357 SIG ammo is exceptionally fast and powerful. It’s a top performer when it comes to penetration and expansion. It’s been adopted by a number of Federal and State Agencies like the Secret Service, the Texas Rangers, the Federal Air Marshals, and the Virginia State Police. The round’s impressive ballistics make it a great choice for duty and self-defense use.

   The 10mm Automatic is one of the most ballistically impressive rounds ever designed for a combat handgun. Designed for Marine Colonel and firearm’s instructor Jeff Cooper, the 10mm was designed to be the ultimate handgun fighting round. It was briefly adopted by the FBI, and currently serves with Denmark’s Sirius patrols to defend troopers from bears. The round has recently seen a resurgence with ammunition and firearm manufacturers.  
   Full powered 10mm ammo mirrors 357 Magnum in power and velocity, and in an automatic handgun offers an impressive capacity. 10mm ammo can be used for a variety of roles, including hunting, self-defense, and competition shooting. The 10mm automatic can be loaded in a variety of ways. It can be loaded light with minimal recoil for recreational plinking, or to full power for hunting and self-defense use.

   The great thing about America is someone can look at something like the 45 Colt and decided they want something even bigger. That’s what Dick Casull and Jack Fullmer must’ve decided when they took the task of building a bigger 45 caliber cartridge for revolvers. The 454 Casull was born in 1957 and lived as a wildcat cartridge up until 1998 when SAAMI finally published a set of standards for it. The 454 Casull is a powerhouse of a round. It’s capable of tossing a 300 grain projectile at over 1,600 feet per second.  
   This makes the round perfect for hunting medium to large North American game. It’s also one of the better and more controllable choices for self-defense against wild game up to bears. The 454 Casull is a flat shooting round that retains an impressive amount of velocity out to 100 yards when fired from a revolver.  
   The 454 Casull round can typically be tough to find, but at Ammunition Depot our in-stock guarantee is there to ensure you always have premium options for bulk 454 Casull. Beside always having ammo in stock we pride ourselves on our customer service and our staff’s expert knowledge. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot our staff an email and we’ll guide you through the ammo selection process.">

  5.56 NATO ammo and 223 ammo (Remington) are brothers who share the same Mother. 223 ammo is the older brother and was designed in 1962 by Remington Arms. The round was being specifically designed for the military and their desire for a lightweight combat rifle. The round would eventually evolve and become the 5.56 x 45mm NATO. This round was adopted in the 1970s and became and remains the standard NATO round. 
   The 223 Remington was designed in 1962 for civilian shooters looking for a lightweight and easy shooting sporting round. A mere two years after its inception it was adapted for use by the United States military with their brand new M16 rifle. The round would later go on to be modified and adopted by NATO as the 5.56x45mm NATO round. While the rounds are largely interchangeable, it is unsafe to fire 5.56 rounds in rifles only designed for 223 due to high pressures. However, rifles chambered in 5.56 can shoot 223 ammo safely.  
   Both 5.56 and 233 ammo look and function identically. The difference comes in the pressure the rounds create and function with. 223 ammo feels most of its pressure in the center of the case. 5.56 ammo feels pressure near the throat. This is important for specific weapons since weapons chambered in 5.56 can fire both 5.56 and 223 REM. Weapons chambered in 223 REM should only fire 223 REM to maintain consistent function.  
   As for performance, 5.56 NATO and 223 ammunition are similar with the 5.56 often having a higher overall velocity. The 223 Remington was designed with sportsman and target shooters in mind. The 223 Remington is an excellent choice for hunters when the proper ammo is chosen. The 223 Rem round is great for small game and pests, as well as predators like coyote, and can even take medium sized game like deer and even small pig species. The 223 Rem is also an excellent home defense round with the proper projectile.  
   The 5.56 NATO ‘s higher pressure and military background typically makes it a better choice for duty, tactical, and home defense use. 5.56 NATO offers higher velocities and often better penetration against barriers.

   The 7.62x51 started life as an American military cartridge and eventually became one of America’s favorite hunting rounds, the 308 Winchester. The 7.62 NATO was developed in the Postwar United States and was designed to be the main fighting round in the United States military. Both rifles like the M14 and machine guns like the M60 chambered the round. The 7.62 round became standardized by NATO and the 308 Win became the favorite of hunters around the world.  
   308 ammo is typically loaded to a higher pressure than 7.62x51 NATO. When choosing which to buy it's best to refer to the proof marks on your rifle’s barrel, or your gun’s manual.

   The 7.62x39 ammo is one of the most successful intermediate rifle rounds ever created. The round has been serving around the world since 1944. It was created in response to the Second World War. The Russians observed most fighting taking place under 300 meters where lighter and shorter weapons had significant advantages. It's often called AK 47 ammo since it famously served in the most widely produced rifles in the world, the AK 47. However, it’s also used in rifles like the SKS, the SIG Sauer 556R, the CZ 527, and dozens of other rifles.  
   The 7.62x39 ammo is common and affordable. We offer you the option of buying by the box, or investing in bulk 7.62x39 ammo to save a little money long term.

   There have been few revolutions in ammunition like the 5.7x28mm. This odd round defies most expectations and even most titles. 5.7x28 ammo walks the line between a rifle and pistol round. It was designed to function in both long guns and handguns and was to fulfill a NATO replacement contract for the 9mm round. It delivered superior performance from both a handgun and long gun when compared to a 9mm round. The smaller diameter round allows a greater magazine capacity.  
   While NATO chugged along with the 9mm cartridge the 5.7 x 28 proved to be a popular round in both handguns and rifles. In a handgun its reaches over 1,600 feet per second, and with a rifle you are looking at speeds in excess of 2,000 fps. What’s important to keep in mind is how lightweight and light recoiling this round is while achieving that performance. The round is flat shooting, accurate, and suitable for small game hunting at close range.  
   If you are looking to stock up on bulk 5.7x28 you have come to the right place. We offer competitive pricing, and we are proud of our customer service. Speaking of customer service, if you have questions feel free to shoot us an email and we’ll go above and beyond to make sure you choose the right 5.7 x 28 ammo for your needs.">

   The 30-06 is an American rifle round designed over a hundred years ago. The round’s name is pronounced thirty-ought-six and it’s a unique designation for what at the time was a unique round. The thirty comes from the .30 caliber projectile the round is topped with and the ought-six comes from the fact the round was invented in 1906. The round would go on to inspire most western 30 caliber rounds, and as a round was a massive success. 30-06 served during both World Wars, as well as Korea, and into the early years of Vietnam.  
   These days 30-06 ammo is the choice of mostly American hunters and historical competition shooters. The 30-06 is a shoulder thumping, powerhouse of a round that can send a 180 grain projectile downrange at 2,700 feet per second. It’s accurate and hard hitting and capable of taking animals as big as elk and moose.  
   We offer 30-06 ammo in varying loads, some for hunting, and others for those classic military rifles.

   300 Blackout is one of the newest rounds on the commercial market. The 300 Blackout round was designed by suppressor company AAC and was intended for AR 15 platforms. The 300 Blackout round was designed to reach max velocity from a barrel as short as 9 inches, making it possible to produce short and effective rifles chambered in the cartridge. Additionally, the 300 Blackout could utilize both supersonic and subsonic rounds reliably. 300 Blackout ammo can weigh anywhere from 123 grains to 220 grains.  
   The subsonic rounds are perfect for shooters running a suppressor who want a silent and reliable semi-automatic rifle. Additionally, 300 Blackout ammunition utilizes 223 Remington cases as its parent case. The overall length of the rounds is identical to standard 223/556 ammunition and this allows AR owners the ability to convert their rifles with minimal changes. In fact, 300 Blackout is compatible with 5.56 magazines, BCGs, upper and lower receivers, buffers assemblies and more. The most notable difference between a 300 Blackout and 223 5.56 AR is going to be the barrel and gas system.  
   The 300 Blackout as a round has proven to be popular enough to find itself in a wide variety of rifles, including bolt actions and single shots.

As you can assume, it’s an old round. It was born in 1895 and has since become an American hunting classic. It’s likely more deer have been taken with a 30-30 than any other round. It’s a round that just works.  
   30-30 ammo, pronounced thirty thirty, and is occasionally called 30 Winchester Centerfire, or 30 WCF. It’s a round designed for lever action guns, so it features a prominent rim much like a revolver cartridge. The first 30 stands for 30 caliber, and the second 30 stands for 30 grains of smokeless powder. This makes up the standard 30-30 load. The round was designed for hunting medium sized game like deer and hogs. In a lever gun it makes a nice brush cartridge for close range hunting. It’s moderate recoil and hard-hitting power, combined with the fast action of a lever gun makes it perfect stumbling across that unexpected buck.

While the round sees military use, it’s more common in the hands of big game hunters, long-range competitors and recreational shooters. Its terminal performance is so impressive it’s allowed for use when hunting Africa’s big five.

   America really loves their 45 caliber projectiles. From the 45 Colt and 45 ACP to the 45-70 we tend to go with bigger is better. The 45-70 is a bit different because it was designed to be a rifle round. The 45-70 is an old round, it was designed in 1873 and is still going strong. Going strong in both its popularity and its power. The 45 in 45-70 stands for a 45 caliber projectile and 70 stands for the standard 70 grains of black powder used to propel the round. 45-70 is still in use by the military as a blank round that is used with line throwing guns aboard Naval vessels.  
   Modern 45-70 ammo is loaded differently these days, but are still just as powerful. The round itself is now even loaded to some extremely large revolvers for hunting and silhouette shooting. Modern 45-70 ammo is capable of taking any game on the North American continent and is an absolute shoulder slapper of a round.

Similar to .458 SOCOM, this unique cartridge was designed to meet the needs of individuals who needed to use AR15 style weapons but take down targets much more diligently than any 5.56x45 could hope to. Originally proposed by Col. Jeff Cooper as the "Thumper" concept, Cooper wanted a big game rifle chambered for something larger than a .44, was semi automatic, and that was capable of accuracy at 250 yards away.   In 2007, the .450 Bushmaster came to life with the  250-grain pointed SST Flex-Tip bullet, ready to take down any game that may come your way. '>

   The 458 Socom is a bore round initially designed for the AR 15. The idea behind the round was to provide the military with a powerful, fighting stopping round designed for use in close quarters combat. The idea came to be due to troops clearing caves in Afghanistan and their standard 5.56 rounds failing to quickly stop opposing forces. The big bore 458 Socom round nearly replicates the performance of the 45-70 Government, but is better suited for semi-auto actions.  
   The round was never adopted for military use, but found a home on the civilian market. 458 Socom ammo is naturally subsonic so it's easy to effectively suppress. It also hits some significant force and with the right hollow point load the wound cavity will be massive. This makes a solid hunting round for medium to large game. It's even a capable round for bear.  
   458 ammo even fits in a standard 30 round AR 15 magazine, but it limits the capacity to ten rounds due to the round’s size. We offer a variety of AR 15 magazines that are compatible with the 458 Socom, and you can check those out here. At Ammunition Depot we offer a wide selection of 458 Socom ammo for sale and match that with our low prices and you have an unbeatable combination.">

              <a href="https://www.ammunitiondepot.com/306-50-bmg" title='Bulk 50 BMG / 50 Cal Ammo 
   The best design philosophies start with phrases like, “Bigger is better." That must have certainly been the case when John Browning designed the 50 BMG round. His initial idea was a scaled up 30-06 along with a scaled up machine gun to handle it. The 50 cal BMG was born to be an anti-vehicular and anti-air round and entered service in 1921. It’s been used in every conflict the U.S. Military engaged in since 1921 and is still a favorite anti-material round of the armed forces.  
   The round has been adopted by rifle shooters in a variety of semi-automatic, bolt action, and single shot rifle platforms. The 50 BMG is capable of reaching extreme ranges, making it a favorite of long range shooters. The 50 BMG is a massively powerful round, capable of throwing a 750-grain round at 2,820 feet per second and delivering over 13,000 foot pounds of energy. This massive amount of power is a challenge to control, but makes it possible to hit targets at beyond a mile.  
   Clubs like the Fifty Caliber Shooter’s Association hold matches across the country for 50 cal shooters to come and prove their mettle. If you are looking to feed the beast with some quality and accurate ammunition, we offer a selection of cheap 50 cal ammo that’s hard to beat at Ammunition Depot.'>

   The 6.5 Creedmoor, or 6.5 CM, is a rising star in the long range, short action rifle realm. It was produced in 2008 by Hornady and became an immediate favorite. 6.5 Creedmoor ammo utilizes a common bolt face that makes building a customized rifle very easy. The use of a 6.5 projectile gives the cartridge an excellent ballistic coefficient and 6.5 rounds tend to have a high sectional density.  
   The 6.5 Creedmoor can reach similar velocities and muzzle energies as the 300 Winchester Magnum. It does this with less overall recoil and in a short action rifle. The 6.5 Creedmoor has found acceptance with both competitive shooters and hunters. Hunters prefer the round due to its power and accuracy. Competition shooters love its consistency and its long-range accuracy. In fact, in the hands of professional shooters it can maintain a sub MOA group size out to 1,000 yards.  
   What’s your goal with the 6.5 Creedmoor? To take a whitetail at a few hundred yards, or to ring steel at 1,000 yards? Once you’ve answered that question check out Ammunition Depots selection of 6.5 Creedmoor ammo. We carry ammo for every occasion, and our competitive pricing is hard to beat.">

The round was designed in 2003 and was designed to surpass the performance of the 5.56 in accuracy, power, and range. The 6.5 Grendel ammo succeeded in its goals and has become a popular alternative to the 5.56/223 Remington in the AR platform.  
   The round has achieved popularity outside of the AR series of rifles and has even found itself in the AK platform as well as bolt action and single shot rifles. With the right 6.5 Grendel ammo you can hit targets out to 800 yards effectively. The 6.5 Grendel round has found the most success as a sporting round.

   The 6.8 Special Purpose Cartridge, or 6.8 SPC, is a modern round developed by Remington, the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, and the U.S. Special Operation Command. It was designed to provide longer range and more power than the 5.56 in an AR 15 platform. The round completed its goal, but was not adopted for military service. It found new life with hunters looking to use a rifle as light and handy as an AR 15, but in a more potent caliber for moderately large game.  
   The 6.8 SPC round is exceptionally accurate and an easy conversion on AR platforms. The round was also utilized in Ruger’s Mini 14 series and several bolt action rifle designs. Its moderate recoil made it excellent for follow up shots on wounded, or dangerous game. Companies like Hornady developed specialized hunting loads for the round and the round exploded in popularity among hunters for game ranging from white tailed deer to black bear.  
   The 6.8 SPC is an accurate and hard hitting round for hunters, sport shooters, and marksmen. At Ammunition Depot we offer cheap 6.8 SPC ammo for every type of shooter.

It’s still found in the deer stand, on the battlefield and in the hands of collectors worldwide. The 7.62x54r is a full powered rifle round that is still capable of performing with modern rifle cartridges.  
   7.62x54R ammo is one of the cheapest full powered rifle rounds on the market. It’s quite powerful and a 150 grain projectile can reach nearly 3,000 feet per second. The round itself is suited for hunting large deer species, hogs, and as our friends in Russian have proven it’s a bear stopper. The round’s popularity for hunting has resulted in some high-end hunting ammunition being produced that’s still priced surprisingly low.  
   Bulk 7.62x54R ammo is easy to find and the rounds range anywhere from surplus military ammo, to accurized hunting ammo and everything in between. We have a large selection of 7.62 x 54R ammunition and we keep our prices competitive. ">

   In 1962 Remington made two major introductions to their lineup and the rifle world in general. They introduced their now flagship rifle the Remington 700 and the 7mm Remington Magnum. Of course, the first Rem 700s were chambered in Remington’s new magnum caliber. The 7mm Rem Mag was an instant hit, and obtained a majority market share in long action magnum caliber quite quickly. The 7mm Rem Mag outperforms even the venerable 30-06 Springfield in performance and power.  
   7mm projectiles offer a better ballistic coefficient than 7.62 or 30 caliber projectiles. This means they go further and hit harder more accurately. This flat shooting round is perfect for shooting over long distances, and maintains its strength over longer distances. It makes an excellent round for hunting over fields and plains. It’s powerful enough to take any game in North America and accurate enough to be adopted by the U.S. Secret Service for counter sniper operations.  
   At Ammunition Depot we are excited to offer you a selection of 7mm Rem Mag for sale, as well as the option for bulk 7mm Rem Mag ammo. We have competitive pricing, and of course our in-stock guarantee makes sure we have it when you need it.">

   Magpul never rested, and continued to improve the design releasing new generations as they made improvements. They added windows to their magazines, expanded into the AK realm, and even produced a reliable drum magazine where many had failed. Their magazines have been widely adopted by police and military forces, and even serve with groups like the U.S. Navy SEALs.  
   We carry a full selection of Magpul PMAGs, including magazines for the AR 15, the AK 47 series of rifles, and the AR 10 series. We even carry the higher capacity 40 round AR mags and the 60 round Magpul Drums. If you want to save a little money check out our bulk Magpul PMAGs for our lowest price possible.">
