     Two-thirds of this volume is disposable.
 After 1975, what lives of "M. John Harrison" is his fiction (and to some extent his interviews, although not the one included here).
 The "critical writings" of 1979 and 1980 are disengaged, distracted, throwing handfuls of ill-sorted proper names like pebbles against a window. From 1990 on, the byline occasionally appears on reliably professional man-of-letters book reviews in professional man-of-letters venues; not bad, not where the action is.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no admirer of artisanal butchery should be without the young-loud-and-snotty pieces published beween 1969 and 1975.
 I was most impressed by his doomed berserker whirls against the incoming tide of Tolkien's fantasy ("By Tennyson Out of Disney")

     side-tracking, argument from the wrong side of the analogy, rhetoric as a substitute for logic, the accidental modification of premises (or even subject matter). It is not rigorous. Its vocabulary consists almost wholly of terms like “granted” and “posit”, “given” and “for the sake of argument”; its grammar is punctuative, the oratorical “right?” and “agreed?” used as fish-glue to cement unrelated items; its impromptu syntax reflects its impromptu reasoning; it is a muck of colloquialisms and jargon words used outside their proper fields.
 [...]
     <p>
      In lieu of actual thought, Rackham and Coney offer brash, colloquial pontification, achieved through disembodied mouthpieces; Del Rey senses that “science” has something to do with careful reasoning, but embraces opinion instead; Maine bases his entire extrapolative argument on nothing more than a value-judgement, effectively bypassing the mouthpiece and presenting his cant direct.

      Thought and prose cannot be considered as discrete states: the one modifies the other, to infinity. None of the above writers can make a precise, sensible prose, only a vague uncommunicative babble. Meanwhile, the IDEA! bulbs flash stroboscopically, and with each little explosion science fiction reels back, bemused by its own ability to think of things. With each brief illumination of the irresistible
      <i>

      Back at John Rackham’s table they’ve got the drinks in against closing time. The amateur sociologists and historians and technocrats are wiping foam off their lips.

      “That is simply the logical extension of your postulate.”

      this is the style of the Seventies. The editorial toad has escaped from the centre pages; comment has eaten the news; punditry swallows both. The majority reveals itself as a broil of minorities, each convinced of its own indispensability and itself comprised of as many minorities as it has adherents. We speak, eventually, in private languages. Fiction isn’t

     "Style is respect for real life" - Joanna Russ
    </h4>
    <p>
     Pilgrims from the high-mainstream should be put at ease by the conceptual purity of
     <i>
      We Who Are About to...
     </i>
     , fantasy &amp; science fiction fans may appreciate the eclectic ingredients of
     <i>
      The Adventures of Alyx
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      Picnic on Paradise
     </i>
     , those who remember a world without female cops (or with Donald Trump) could beat a path to
     <i>
      The Female Man
     </i>
     , those who've watched novel repressions bloodily defended by appeals to "tradition" might brave the pinch of
     <i>
      The Two of Them
     </i>
     ,  and we who consider
     <i>
      pretentious
     </i>
     more prescriptive than insulting may repeatedly extend our rebuffed sympathy to
     <i>
      And Chaos Died
     </i>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Or not; Joanna Russ's novels are not to all tastes. And her star hasn't risen since 1980, or even stayed put.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of its decline can be put down to historical contingencies, such as the long illness which froze her career midstream, the loss of in-print backstock among publishers in general, and her books' post-publication consignment to gender-branded presses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some might be due to history in a less flattering sense: references die; battle cries fade from infuriating to quaint.
 Seventeen-year-olds of today who attempt
     <i>
      The Female Man
     </i>
     might become as irritably alienated as the book's own Janet: "What the
     <i>
      fuck
     </i>
     is a
     <i>
      Pogo!?
     </i>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     Even given access and accessbility, Russ can be a tough sell. The sales resistance pushes against something essential.
 Across genres, across the controversies and dogmas of her alotted dozen years, Joanna Russ's writing is distinguished by its
     <i>
      style
     </i>
     .
 Stylishness in a crafts sense
     <span class="hair">
     </span>
     —
     <span class="hair">
     </span>
     balanced composition, precision of fit, and tonal shapeliness
     <span class="hair">
     </span>
     —
     <span class="hair">
     </span>
     but also style as "that characteristic stink we're unable to cover up or scrub away."
 The dedicated craftswoman removes the debris and rot which might obscure that signature scent, and thereby makes it
     <a href="http://sensesofcinema.com/2005/feature-articles/cluny_brown/" title="Yes, but it looks interesting. Very.">
      unignorable
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     All Russ's novels relate cruel truths with exuberant indulgence in an unshakeably arch tone, driven by anger on behalf of tenderness. In this she's an
     <a href="https://olinuris.library.cornell.edu/parallax/russ">
      American daughter to Nabokov
     </a>
     ; an expressionist after the impressionist, what she lacked in sensual stupefaction, she gained in drive and focus.
 Nabokov himself, however, is not everybody's cup of frightful garbage. I've heard middling-sort readers call him "creepy," and it's a reasonable reaction to that imperturbable hybrid of sneer and icky-sticky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Us hyar elite-folks are trained into different repulsions.
 Contemporary crossover Thomas M. Disch was protected by his mimicry; crossover Philip K. Dick was protected by his hackery.
 But the voice of Joanna Russ's texts is the voice of Joanna Russ. That's the one voice you'll hear,
 and it broadcasts unabashed uncool earnestness with almost every sentence.
 The sound of the home-grown red-blooded ever-lovin' American intellectual: cutesy, dimissive, show-offish, and disgracefully lacking in abjectivity.
    </p>
    <p>
     For us whose native tongue is demotic geek, it's like submitting to the indignity of dialect writing.
 Nabokov's aristocratic ironies and charities may grow tiresome but they're not
     <i>
      embarrassing
     </i>
     .
 Can such contemptible familiarity be redeemed by mere euphony, insight, and structural novelty?
 I can't rightly say, but last I checked I was still able to creakily dismount my leased high-horse, at least for the extent of a long walk through the old neighborhood, surrounded by the neighborly sounds of a swaggering gray squirrel, a cozily quarrelsome scrub-jay family, or an American robin, that "gross fowl with its untidy dull-red livery and revolting gusto."

     The movie's triumph is to prove that Oscar Wilde's jolting, jammed, and stalling lines can in fact be delivered engagingly, amusingly, and even naturally. The movie's tragedy is that only Glynis Johns can deliver them. And although a little Glynis Johns goes a long way, 96 minutes is longer than a little Glynis Johns can go.

      I have a similar soft spot for 1993's
      <i>
       Graffiti Kitchen
      </i>
      . After a decade of charming groove,
      <i>
       Graffiti Kitchen
      </i>
      was a "departure," as the critics say.
      <i>
       The King Canute Crowd
      </i>
      's scrappy Zip-a-Tone vanished along with grins, pratfalls, and pubbish inconsequence. Instead, Campbell scratched the page till it bled.
     </p>
     <p>
      The departure was permanent. Starting with his next personal work, Campbell changed "Alec"'s genre, marital status, profession, homeland, and (before long) name. That new groove spooled over the next two decades and there at the end of the spool lies
      <i>
       The Lovely Horrible Stuff
      </i>

    <p>
     On the explicit face-and-title-page of it, "Lovely Horrible Stuff" refers to
     <i>
      money
     </i>
     , but most readers easily spot
     <i>
      family
     </i>
     squirming under that label, too.
 Either way,whether enthusiastic or not-so-much, whether amateur or professional, reviewers saw the book as another slice of a familiar cranked sausage.
 A plurality of Campbell's post-
     <i>
      Canute
     </i>
     work depicts the unresolvable conflict between
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
     <li>
      a professional livelihood which can only be sustained by vigilant hunting, scavenging, and hoarding
     </li>
     <p style="margin-left: -2em;">
      and
     </p>
     <li>
      a professional practice which can only be sustained by free-floating reverie and temporary delusions of omnipotent control,
     </li>
    </ol>
    and since at least
    <i>
     The Dance of Lifey Death
    </i>
    the conflict's been iconized as an obscuring thought balloon.
 Domestic squabbles and worse, in the grand tradition of newspaper comics and stand-up comedy, were there from the start of "Alec"/"Campbell"'s marriage.
 Furious dunning letters had been a mainstay gag since Shakespeare started penning them in 1992's
    <i>
     The Cheque Mate
    </i>
    .
 Campbell's discursive impulse had already digressed into informal research and documentary across a multitude of single-pagers and one-offs over the years.
 So, not much new.

     well, reactions ranged from masterful to amateurish. My own was, if I had to pick a word, "worrisome." Not the failed reassurance of CGI's uncanny valley; not with that Photoshop-airbrush applied like mascara in a Kuchar movie. Something sadder, more Cronenbergian....

    <p>
     In other ways, too,
     <i>
      Stuff

     seemed to me like a business-as-usual brim shading some sort of breakout, or breakthrough, or breakdown....
 Yes, "Campbell" had dunned before, but never so close to home:

     Even when
     <i>
      The Fate of the Artist
     </i>
     's domestic violence drew blood, it was more or less successfully played for laffs.
 But the staging went awry this time round:
     <i>
      Stuff'
     </i>
     s most physical conflict lacked any hint of slapstick, and Campbell's dash towards the safety of a gag pointedly flopped. The closest thing to nuptial comfort is confined to one page of such nakedly intense nostalgia that I avert my eyes whenever I reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite its egocentrism (in the sense of heliocentrism), frets, and blunders, the
     <i>
      Alec
     </i>
     series never seemed neurotic or despairing. Even at the end of one's rope, you (almost) always reached stabilizing humor. The
     <a href="ht-20110923.html#2011-10-30" title="Stuff past-tense; Kitchen present-tense, with no room for regrets">
      previous first-person installment
     </a>
     kicked that stool aside. In
     <i>
      Stuff
     </i>
     , it's liable to tip over, and the failures convey self-loathing with more conviction than anything R. Crumb or Joe Matt ever mustered: as comics characters, at least, "Matt" and "Crumb" are mercifully numb to personal responsibility, much less responsibility for three children.

     Structurally,
     <i>
      The Lovely Horrible Stuff
     </i>
     is an odd book out as well, almost two books, scored down the middle for easy snapping:
    </p>
    <p>
     First a pacing round "Campbell"'s loathings, delusions, and losses, punctuated by brief vocational escapes into Cloudintellectualpropertyland. In this half of the book, we don't see his memorable fancies for ourselves; they're drawn as simple icons or fogbanks. "Campbell" has left the building, and like other characters we're stuck with his blind and deaf husk.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second half shows one place he went: a continuously engaged topic-and-travel documentary (as opposed to the memoir documentary of
     <i>
      How to Be an Artist).
     </i>
     "Campbell" looks happiest here, in the inflated non-ego of not-painstakingly-verified research and formal control, semidetached from the ground while remaining firmly of the world, floating/sinking by his clutch of stone balloons....

    I itched to write about

    after my first half-dozen readings or so.

 As years went by with no Campbell news other than reprints, illustrations, and, more recently, a

     , the topic started to feel a bit taboo, as if the book's toxicity had leaked into the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because, like
     <i>
      Graffiti Kitchen

     , it did taste toxic, or (depending on the taster) bracingly medicinal.

     put paid to the King Canute sequence; a new sequence began. Apart from the hero's signature look, what made this second, longer, sequence part of "Alec" was Campbell's faith that a world of omnipotent imagination might be built on the unscrupulous details of the real. Unlikely sounding, maybe, but certainly not

    <p>
     Aestheticism-and-reality as vocation, meanness-and-dreaminess as motif, material-and-virtual as technique: three knockabout marriages of stubborn antitheses.
 If it was true that, after a quarter-century, the series had again scorched its own earth, where would it migrate next?

    <p>
     I'd still be wondering if I'd continued to
     <i>
      look
     </i>
     for word: the aftermath's been described only in audio.
 Campbell-the-artist killed his series hero off before
     <i>
      The Fate of the Artist
     </i>
     began. Having resurrected him in good American comic book fashion, what could the artist do for an encore? The solution was straightforward, if not exactly satisfying.

     I'm not entering this old nag in the Tragedy Sweepstakes; my bookie says the fix is in for Climate Collapse. Still, one of the most trivially persistent annoyances of living in interesting times is how much more boring it makes me. Conversation has always been my sustaining pleasure, but at age 58 I've reached stable and fully-articulated conclusions on so many common conversational topics that I can empty a room of interlocuters in half an hour. Since I'm not sure I want to ripen into full Harold-Bloom, I'm increasingly limited to uncommon conversational topics.

     Therein a glance into the unsolvable labyrinth of Ideas in Things, as the poet sang, or, to prosify the poet, the strange entanglement of subject-minds with subject-matters, particles-of-the-observer refracting right through the most solid of apperceived bodies. Thereby a handful of handcarved woodchips off the spiritual block supporting M. John Harrison's Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, minus the colorless flavorless icing of super-science.

      Thanks for calling my attention to Greenblatt's sentimental essay. I like its atavism: one can imagine Howe or Fiedler or some other midcentury cosmopolitan recounting similar adventures and sentiments. Indeed, I expect Greenblatt's approach owes something to the novelists whom those Intellectuals influenced. My uncle would have enjoyed the piece, and I'm sure Greenblatt's friend Natalie ate it up.

       Anent respectable edginess, the erstwhile Miss Spentyouth recently began a Facebook conversation that culminated in people discussing whether they were edgelords or edgevassals . . . I should have staked a claim for the nascent edgebourgoisie.

     One of the things the fourth season of "The Wire" got right was that upward-mobility selects for glibness. I made it into an exclusive private college (via an alumni in-person interview and pre-Reagan financial aid) and I don't know as I ever scored an A in a class that didn't rely heavily on in-person discussion.

      Date-range web searches support my memory that the "resonates with me" formula, with its two-way passivity, first became ubiquitous after 2000.

     Some people describe life as a shopping list carried in a bucket (that's how big their shopping list is, they have to keep it in a bucket!), followed by an inventory of assets and an itemized bill.
    </p>
    <p>
     How do they sum a sequence like
     <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 - 7 + ...
     </span>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Does a scuffed-up crumpled sheet have a sequence at all?

     I can't keep accounts on happiness and grief. But I know what I like, and I like knowing a no-’ccount goes off the books or never on them.
