     About Project Pluto:
    </b>
    Project Pluto supplies astronomical
 software, both commercial and freeware,  to amateur and professional
 astronomers.  The foremost product is the
    <a href="faqnew.htm">
     Guide
 DVD Star Chart,
    </a>
    a powerful general-purpose charting/desktop
 planetarium tool.  The main purpose of this program is star chart
 generation,  and it is unsurpassed in this area;  but it also provides
 immense amounts of data on the objects displayed,  ephemerides,  telescope
 control,  and other useful features.
   </p>
   <p>
    The
    <a href="find_orb.htm">
     Find_Orb
    </a>
    orbit determination software
 can take a set of positional measurements of an asteroid,  comet,  or
 natural or artificial satellite,  and determine its orbit.

    There is a list of particularly
    <a href="interest.htm">
     interesting events to simulate
    </a>
    using Guide.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some information about the
    <a href="accuracy.htm">
     precision of
 planetary positions and other aspects of Guide
    </a>
    is available.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some people who have seen the current support for the above languages
 have asked about adding more.  Some
    <a href="xlate.htm">
     information

    </a>
    has been added to this site.

   <p>

     Where Guide users are:
    </b>
    (22 Jun 1999)
    <a href="users.gif">
     Click here for a world map showing where Guide is used.
    </a>
    (There's also a
    <a href="gui_us.gif">
     map showing where Guide is used
 in the United States.)
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    The background shading shows the path of the August 1999 solar
 eclipse,  since Guide's "geographic display" was really added for
 only the purpose of showing eclipses and occultations.  But the
 orange symbols give a rough idea as to where Guide users are.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you're a current Guide user and would like to display this
 dataset on Guide charts,
    <a href="extras.htm#geo_.tdfs">
     click here.
    </a>
    (Given the file at that link,  you will be able to zoom in for greater
 detail.)  The dataset/chart was built out of both pure curiosity and
 as an example of how "user-added datasets" work on geographical data.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the above chart shows,  there is currently a Guide user at the
    <a href="http://www.antdiv.gov.au/stations/davis/">
     Davis Station
    </a>
    in Antarctica,  as well as one at the South Pole research station,  so
 Guide is now used on all continents.  About half of Guide users are in
 the US and Canada,  with a lot of users in Western Europe,  Australia,
 and Japan,  plus a few scattered throughout the rest of the world
 (there is one user each in Tahiti,  New Guinea, Siberia,  Iran,  and
 Pakistan,  for example).  Oddly enough,  while there are a few dozen
 users in Hong Kong and South Africa,  there are none at all (so far) in
 the rest of Africa or in mainland China.
