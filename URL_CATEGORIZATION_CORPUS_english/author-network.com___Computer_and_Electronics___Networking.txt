Her exuberance–her pure force of will–will see to it not only that you read Fear of Writing but that you also read it right. That is, you must pause to do the exercises which she calls (aptly) “fertile material.” And if you but think of sitting back on your laurels for having gone this far, her enthusiasm will propel you forward.
