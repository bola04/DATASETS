      4. Millions of people from the
      <strong>
       United States of America play bingo for real money
      </strong>
      , but only around 25% play bingo online. This is surprising because once you give online bingo a try you will think that the Internet was invented exclusively to perfect the art of playing this fun game. Online bingo is much more profitable for players compared to church bingo and other live bingo events. 90% of live bingo games have to donate half of their proceeds to schools and/or charities. You are only getting $.50 in value for every $1 you spend on bingo cards. The same can be said for lottos too. That is insane. Here is a comparison. Let's say you and a friend Sarah are going to flip a coin. If you lose you have to pay her $1 but if you win she only has to pay you $.50. That is what offline bingo is like. The comparison for Blackjack would be that if she wins you pay her $1 and if you win she pays you $.98. That sounds much better right? That is how online bingo sites work. They only take a tiny percentage of the pot so you are not losing much value on your money.

      sites also give back much of this money in the form of promotions, bonuses, free prizes, contests, bingo freerolls and no deposit bingo bonuses. A no deposit bonus is basically a free real money gift given to those who sign up. It's purpose is to allow new players to get the full real money online bingo experience before they decide if they want to make a deposit and play.
      <em>
       No deposit bonuses at U.S. bingo sites
      </em>
      are usually only $5-$10 but I work closely with the top three bingo sites for U.S. players in 2014 and was lucky enough to negotiate an instant $25 no deposit bonus at each. You can be
      <strong>

      within 5 minutes. The withdrawal requirements on this
      <em>

      are very light and are only designed to discourage fraud and bonus abuse. You can actually get a check for hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the mail in less than a week without ever having to deposit. The most popular

      and

      4 are listed below. These US bingo sites offer a wide range of bingo game rooms.

      Downtown Bingo for example is comprised of several $1/card rooms, $.50/card rooms, $.10/ card rooms, freeroll bingo rooms and fixed limit rooms where everyone will buy 10 cards for $2.50. Each room has it's own bingo host, theme and progressive jackpots. Many of the largest jackpots ever won online did not take place at an online casino. Online bingo may not be as popular as online casino gambling but bingo jackpots hold several records and have exceeded $10 million dollars. The following
      <strong>

      all offer bingo freerolls. You basically get
      <em>
       free bingo cards
      </em>
      and there is a real money prize pool. These run 24-7 and you can play in as many as you like. I know several bingo players who never deposit when they run out of money. They just play these
      <em>

      and build up a big enough bankroll to play in the regular bingo rooms.

      The

       real money USA bingo sites
      </strong>
      listed above are very easy to deposit at, play at and withdraw from. Most Americans who want to
      <strong>
       play online bingo for money in the USA
      </strong>
      simply use their Visa or Mastercard to make a deposit. They accept debit, credit and prepaid card deposits. Bingo is very recreational so you can deposit as little as $10-$20. I have played live bingo at places like
      <a href="http://www.dolphinbingo.com/" target="_blank">

      but I still prefer playing online. Online

      is most likely going to be moving to mobile bingo apps. People already play bingo for money on smart phones and tablets but I suspect that by 2015 mobile bingo will be much more popular.
