If prior to Dumarca becoming aware of the error the User has withdrawn the funds that do not belong to the user, without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available at law, the mistakenly paid amount will constitute a debt owed by the User to Dumarca.

            User can request a withdrawal of the deposited amount and any associated cash winnings without meeting the wagering requirement. Should user choose to do this, bonus funds would be returned to Vera&amp;John. For example: User deposits €20 and Dumarca offer you €20 as a deposit bonus. There is then €40 in user’s account. If before meeting the wagering requirements (which usually is 40 times the bonus amount) user wishes to withdraw the deposited amount £20, Dumarca will then retract the bonus before the withdrawal can be approved. If User has already gambled and lost part of the total balance on the account, user can only request a withdrawal of the remaining cash amount and associated cash winnings after the bonus sum has been returned to Vera&amp;John. 
 Cash funds are used first when wagering, bonus funds are used once the cash balance is empty or insufficient.  When placing bets from the bonus balance the bonus wagering requirements must be met before withdrawal; forfeiting the bonus at this stage will result in the removal of the bonus amount and bonus winnings .
 Dumarca reserves the right to refuse or void any bonus offered to any user for reasons including but not restricted to, abuse by the User. (Despite a deposit been associated with a bonus, customer is required to wager the deposit amount at least once. If you choose not to do this, you are required to follow T&amp;C 3.19)

                       User can request a withdrawal of the deposited amount and any associated cash winnings without meeting the wagering requirement. Should user choose to do this, bonus funds would be returned to Vera&amp;John. For example: User deposits €20 and Dumarca offer you €20 as a deposit bonus. There is then €40 in user’s account. If before meeting the wagering requirements (which usually is 40 times the bonus amount) user wishes to withdraw the deposited amount £20, Dumarca will then retract the bonus before the withdrawal can be approved. If User has already gambled and lost part of the total balance on the account, user can only request a withdrawal of the remaining cash amount and associated cash winnings after the bonus sum has been returned to Vera&amp;John. 
 Cash funds are used first when wagering, bonus funds are used once the cash balance is empty or insufficient.  When placing bets from the bonus balance the bonus wagering requirements must be met before withdrawal; forfeiting the bonus at this stage will result in the removal of the bonus amount and bonus winnings .
 Dumarca reserves the right to refuse or void any bonus offered to any user for reasons including but not restricted to, abuse by the User. (Despite a deposit been associated with a bonus, customer is required to wager the deposit amount at least once. If you choose not to do this, you are required to follow T&amp;C 3.19)
