         Apple did not immediately return a request from this reporter for
 comments on whether repairs may now be done on site at stores to
 shorten the time customers must be without their computers;
 whether the keyboard design has changed such that a repair may
 eliminate the problem rather than prop up a faulty design; or
 whether Apple anticipates releasing updated hardware that is not
 so prone to failure at any point in the future. Perhaps their
 keyboards, too, are broken.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Apple has determined that a small percentage of the keyboards in
 certain MacBook and MacBook Pro models may exhibit one or more of
 the following behaviors:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Letters or characters repeat unexpectedly

          Key(s) feel “sticky” or do not respond in a consistent manner
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will service
 eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards, free of charge. The
 type of service will be determined after the keyboard is examined
 and may involve the replacement of one or more keys or the whole
 keyboard.

        If you’ve paid for service that seems like it should have been covered by this program, you should get in touch with Apple.

        Mark Gurman, in a Bloomberg piece headlined “Why Apple’s AirPower Wireless Charger Is Taking So Long to Make”:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         An executive at an Apple partner that manufactures third-party
 wireless chargers for iPhones, who asked not to be identified,
 said the multi-device charging mechanism is challenging to build
 because it likely requires different sized charging components
 for the three types of devices, which would all overlap across
 the mat.
        </p>
        <p>
         The AirPower charger is also more advanced than the current
 competition because it includes a custom Apple chip running a
 stripped down version of the iOS mobile operating system to
 conduct on-device power management and pairing with devices. Apple
 engineers have also been working to squash bugs related to the
 on-board firmware, according to the people familiar. They asked
 not to be identified discussing a product that hasn’t been
 released yet.

        It’s a simple enough app, and seemingly has a good index of podcasts to search for. But the playback interface is a bit spartan — they keep the album art way too small. Anyway, this seems like a well-deserved

         Wyden’s statement praised Verizon for “taking quick action to
 protect its customers’ privacy and security,” but he criticized
 the other carriers for not making the same promise.

         “After my investigation and follow-up reports revealed that
 middlemen are selling Americans’ location to the highest bidder

 portals, Verizon did the responsible thing and promptly announced
 it was cutting these companies off,” Wyden said. “In contrast,
 AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint seem content to continuing to sell

 Americans’ privacy be damned.”

        I love dictionaries. For as long as I can remember, I’ve made a habit of looking up every single word I encounter that I don’t know or am even unsure about. The fact that MacOS and iOS have built-in dictionaries that you can invoke via a contextual menu item is one of my favorite features of both OSes. Part of that is the extraordinary convenience, and part is that both systems use the same excellent source: New Oxford American Dictionary. (MacOS also includes the excellent
        <a href="https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/07/31/reflections-on-language-david-foster-wallace/">
         Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus
        </a>
        — which is apparently coming to iOS, finally, in iOS 12.)
       </p>
       <p>
        But MacOS goes one step further (dating back to its roots as NeXTStep) — it has a built-in Dictionary app, too. I’ve wanted an app like this on iOS since the original iPhone. The App Store is replete with dictionary apps, but most of them are junk. I just want a simple one that uses the system dictionary. My friend Will Hains, who among other things runs the excellent

         @DFStyleguide
        </a>
        Twitter account, shared that desire and went ahead and made one. It’s called Kotoba. It’s been on my first home screen for over two years now.
       </p>
       <p>
        The catch: App Store guidelines disallow using the built-in system dictionary to create a dictionary app (I presume
        <a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1009215199155511297">
         due to licensing issues with Apple’s dictionary partners
        </a>
        ), so you can’t get it from the App Store. Hains released it as open source, though, so if you have a developer account,
        <a href="https://github.com/willhains/Kotoba">
         you can build and install it yourself

       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Bonus Catch:

        Kotoba currently crashes on iOS 12 (including beta 2, released earlier today).

        The pop-up cameras are certainly an original idea (but not a good one), but it’s jaw-dropping how much Oppo (apparently pronounced “OH-poe”) made their “Color OS” Android skin look like iOS, from the home screen to the camera app. This looks nothing like stock Android as seen on a Pixel.

        <p>
         The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has

 wanted a promotion that he did not receive. In light of these
 actions, not promoting him was definitely the right move.

         However, there may be considerably more to this situation than
 meets the eye, so the investigation will continue in depth this

 at Tesla and if he was working with any outside organizations.

 Tesla to die. These include Wall Street short-sellers, who have
 already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more.
 Then there are the oil &amp; gas companies, the wealthiest industry in
 the world — they don’t love the idea of Tesla advancing the
 progress of solar power &amp; electric cars. Don’t want to blow your
 mind, but rumor has it that those companies are sometimes not
 super nice. Then there are the multitude of big gas/diesel car
 company competitors. If they’re willing to cheat so much about
 emissions, maybe they’re willing to cheat in other ways?

        How Will Apple Sell Its Original Video Content?

        Peter Kafka, writing for Recode in the wake of Apple’s content deal with Oprah Winfrey:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <p>
           Some industry observers expect Apple to make some or all of the
 content available for free for users of Apple’s TV app, which
 Apple first introduced as a would-be TV guide/hub a couple years
 ago, and is installed by default on all of its devices. Apple
 has told some industry executives it intends to strengthen that
 hub by making it a focal point to sell subscriptions to other
 companies’ TV services, as Amazon already does.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <p>
           Other watchers are convinced Apple will bundle all of its
 content into a very big subscription service, which would
 include Apple Music, along with other benefits like AppleCare.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <p>
           Most interesting and confusing to me: One TV executive who has
 talked to Apple tells me Apple says it intends to sell a
 standalone subscription to its original video shows, priced
 below Netflix, whose standard offering costs $11 a month in
 the U.S.
          </p>
         </li>
        </ul>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        I think scenario 2 is the most likely — just include the original video content with an Apple Music subscription. People are only willing to pay for so many subscriptions, and asking folks to pay separately for Apple Music
        <em>
         and
        </em>
        “Apple TV” is too much to ask in my opinion. One monthly fee and you get all of Apple Music and all of Apple’s original video content. That’s compelling. It also would make it easy for Apple to build up its original content lineup one show at a time. Years from now, Apple could well be offering enough original video content that a standalone video subscription could be feasible — but as they get started, they’re only going to have a handful of shows for a while.
       </p>
       <p>
        (Bundling AppleCare in the same package seems bonkers. One person might own a single Apple device, another might own a dozen Mac Pros. AppleCare, like any extended warranty, only makes sense as something sold per-device, not as a subscription. What
        <em>
         would
        </em>
        be interesting would be if they offered additional iCloud storage along with the standard subscription for music and video content.)

        Drew McCormack:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I don’t want to get into a point-by-point debate on the topic;
 instead, I want to do something that I haven’t seen anyone do: try
 to understand why Apple
         <em>
          don’t
         </em>
         want the sort of free trials that
 are being demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
         Apple currently allows free trials in two forms: if you sell
 subscriptions, you can give customers a free month to try the app;
 and, you can give your app away free, and offer a free In-App
 Purchase (IAP) to unlock all features for a fixed period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         So why does Apple allow these forms, but not offer a more formal
 version of free trials? Most developers seem to assume they are
 deliberately ignoring their protests, for no good reason, or that
 they simply are not willing to dedicate the resources to solve the
 problem. I doubt both of these assumptions. I think Apple have
 probably thought long and hard about it, and concluded that the
 options they have introduced are actually
         <em>
          better
         </em>
         than the free
 trials developer’s are requesting.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        This is a thoughtful piece, and I think McCormack could be correct that this is more or less Apple’s perspective on the matter. And I’ve always thought it useful to try to think about things from Apple’s perspective.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it’s fair to say McCormack’s argument boils down to “
        <em>
         Traditional free trials could be a source of confusion for typical users
        </em>
        ” and he backs that up with some good questions users might have. But I think this is where design comes into play. Design is largely about devising solutions to problems. I can’t help but think there’s a way that Apple could design a system of free trials in the App Store that would not leave typical users confused in any of the ways McCormack suggests.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think “free app with a free in-app purchase to unlock a one-month demo period, which, when expired, will require a $20 in-app purchase” is fundamentally more confusing than “this app costs $20 but you can try it for free for the first month”. You just need good design to make that clear. The former is what we have now, the latter is what the indie community has been clamoring for ever since the App Store debuted. And don’t forget paid upgrades.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Even though the iPhone 3GS will be sold as “brand new,” don’t
 expect it to work the same as a recently released iPhone. The
 iPhone 3GS was discontinued back in 2012, and it only runs iOS
 6. As a result, many apps (and even iMessages) won’t work on
 the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
         The iPhone predates Lightning cables, too, so you’ll be stuck
 using an old-school 30-pin connector.
        </p>
        <p>
         Still, SK Telink is selling the iPhone 3GS for only 44,000 won,
 which is equivalent to $40, £30 or AU$55. So this Apple
 blast-from-the-past could be yours for pretty cheap — if you’re
 in Korea.

         Craig Young, a researcher with security firm Tripwire, said he
 discovered an authentication weakness that leaks incredibly
 accurate location information about users of both the smart
 speaker and home assistant Google Home, and Chromecast, a small
 electronic device that makes it simple to stream TV shows, movies
 and games to a digital television or monitor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Young said the attack works by asking the Google device for a list
 of nearby wireless networks and then sending that list to Google’s
 geolocation lookup services.
        </p>
        <p>
         “An attacker can be completely remote as long as they can get the
 victim to open a link while connected to the same Wi-Fi or wired
 network as a Google Chromecast or Home device,” Young told
 KrebsOnSecurity. “The only real limitation is that the link needs
 to remain open for about a minute before the attacker has a
 location. The attack content could be contained within malicious
 advertisements or even a tweet.”

       <p>
        Young is getting location data accurate to within 10 meters from his exploit. All you have to do to be exposed is open a web page and leave it open for a minute. This is the common sense fear of this whole Internet of Things movement: that these devices we’re putting on our networks aren’t secure, even the ones from big companies like Google.

        New iOS app and web service that makes it easy for people to book appointments with you.
        <a href="https://blog.when.works/announcing-whenworks-mobile-appointment-scheduling/">
         From their blog announcement

        , on what makes WhenWorks unique:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         There are many competitive services in this space. What they all
 have in common is that they are purely web-based solutions. What
 makes WhenWorks unique is that it is a mobile app that integrates
 directly with the Calendar app on your iOS device, is far easier
 to configure and use, more secure, and always with you when you
 need it.
        </p>
        <p>
         WhenWorks supports all of the leading calendar services (iCloud,
 Google Calendar, Office 365 and Outlook.com) but is particularly
 well-suited for those who use iCloud, due to its deep integration
 with the built-in Calendar on iOS.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        WhenWorks was founded by John Chaffee, of
        <a href="https://www.busymac.com/">
         BusyMac
        </a>
        and, back in the day, Now Up-to-Date fame, and he’s put together a really good team. The pricing is outstanding too: 14-day free trial, free-to-use for up to five appointments per month after that, and just $5/month for the pro account with no limits.
       </p>
       <p>
        It’s a really great app, and setting it up couldn’t be easier. Worth checking it out just to examine the UI and on-boarding process, and if you’re the sort of person who has a busy calendar packed with appointments, you’re nuts if you don’t try it.

         If you know the company Square, it’s probably because you’ve paid
 in a store using a Square “stand”, a dock that supports a tablet,
 or you’ve swiped your card through Square Reader, a smartphone
 dongle that processes payments. These products have a soothing,
 decidedly Apple-y aesthetic, from the simple dongle to the
 all-white stand that typically houses an iPad. But since late last
 year, Square has been quietly selling its own custom-made tablet,
 the Square Register, a $999, Android-based system. And the company
 has taken an obsessive approach to designing the product.

       <blockquote>

         At the time of the writing, with the exception of the $5,000 iMac
 Pro, no Macintosh has been updated at all in the past year. […]
        </p>
        <p>
         Rather than attempting to wow the world with “innovative” new
 designs like the failed Mac Pro, Apple could and should simply
 provide updates and speed bumps to the entire lineup on a much
 more frequent basis. The much smaller Apple of the mid-2000s
 managed this with ease. Their current failure to keep the Mac
 lineup fresh, even as they approach a trillion dollar market cap,
 is both baffling and frightening to anyone who depends on the
 platform for their livelihood.

        Compare and contrast with the iPhone, which is updated not just annually, but predictably. Post-WWDC, I’ve had a few friends and readers ask whether they should just go ahead and buy a MacBook or MacBook Pro now — knowing they’re old, knowing the keyboards are of questionable reliability — or wait until fall. I have no idea if new MacBooks are coming in the fall though. It certainly seems like they
        <em>
         should
        </em>
        , but would you really be surprised if we don’t see new MacBooks (and iMacs) until 2019?
       </p>
       <p>
        I’d really love to see Apple get Mac hardware on a roughly annual schedule, even if most years they’re just speed bumps, like they were a decade ago.

          installed macOS on it

         This was intended to be a temporary experiment. And, in fact, I
 hope to replace the NUC with a real Mac mini just as soon as Apple
 finally releases that all-new Mac mini that’s hopefully
 percolating inside Cupertino. But in the meantime, I have been
 running macOS on non-Apple hardware, and it’s been an instructive
 experience.

 A10X in the Apple TV) it’s a slightly faster computer than even
 the maxed-out Mac Mini configuration. Apple TV 4K probably has
 better GPU performance too. In addition to all the performance
 problems stemming from the fact that the Mac Mini hasn’t been
 updated in three years, it’s also inarguable that it’s no longer
 even “mini”. You could arrange four Apple TV units in a 2 × 2
 square and they’d take up the same volume as one Mac Mini.

        I don’t know why this is only going viral now, because it’s a game from last year, but this is amazingly entertaining. The backstory: in the 2015 playoffs, Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley slid hard into second base
        <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-chase-utley-20160526-snap-story.html">
         and Mets second baseman Ruben Tejada wound up with a broken leg
        </a>
        . It was an ugly but legal play and it resulted in MLB changing the rules on how you could slide into bases. This is the first game the Mets played against the Dodgers last year, and pitcher Noah Syndergaard — one of the hardest throwers in the history of baseball — threw a pitch at Utley.
       </p>
       <p>
        The umps ejected Syndergaard and manager Terry Collins from the game. Umpire crew chief Tom Hallion was wearing a mic. The audio is fantastically compelling and profane. If MLB mic’d every ejection
        <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1006992016683696129">
         their TV ratings would soar

        At this point Apple is under three months away from the one-year anniversary of AirPower’s announcement. To be clear, Apple said all along it wouldn’t be shipping until “2018”, but it’s hard not to draw the conclusion that something has gone seriously wrong with this product.

        Yours truly, a year ago, making the case for trackpad support on iPad keyboards:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         In short, when you’re using the iPad’s on-screen keyboard, you
 have a crummy (or at the very least sub-par) keyboard for typing
 but a nice interface for moving the insertion point around. When
 you’re using the Smart Keyboard (or any other hardware keyboard)
 you have a decent keyboard for typing but no good way to move the
 insertion point or select text. Using your finger to touch the
 screen is imprecise, and, when an iPad is propped up laptop-style,
 ergonomically undesirable.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Whenever Apple executives are asked about the notion of touchscreen Macs, they argue, correctly in my opinion, that it’s a bad idea because the ergonomics are bad. It just isn’t comfortable (or precise) to reach out with your arm. There are several other good arguments against adding touchscreen support to Macs, but ergonomics are a good one to place at the top of the list.
       </p>
       <p>
        The thing is, every ergonomic argument against touchscreen MacBooks applies exactly to using an iPad in “laptop mode” with a hardware keyboard. When using a hardware keyboard, it makes sense to keep your hands flat on the desk/table. If Apple thinks iPads are useful with hardware keyboards — and I think they could be — they need to add trackpad support of some kind.

        I was in a busy coffee shop yesterday and looked around. At least 20 patrons were using notebook computers, most of them MacBooks of some sort. Old MacBook Airs (or maybe new MacBook Airs — how can you tell?), MacBook Pros, just-plain MacBooks. Some PC notebooks as well, of course. I didn’t see one person using an iPad — despite the fact that iPads outsell all Macs combined by more than 2-to-1 every single quarter. Would trackpad support alone change that? I don’t know. But it would certainly help, and it’d move us one step closer to

        Sony disallowing cross-platform play kind of sucks — you

        cross-play between Xbox, PC (including Mac), and iOS. It just goes to show the power of being the leading platform. Nintendo is just as lock-in/control-freak minded as Sony, but only Sony is in a position to demand something like this from Epic.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The news comes not long after Epic announced that the game would

       <p>
        If they’ve already ported
        <em>
         Fortnite
        </em>
        to iOS, why haven’t they ported it to Apple TV? That should be easy. The obvious answer: Apple TV is such a non-entity for gaming that Epic doesn’t even consider a relatively easy port to be worth their time.

         Update:

        A few readers have pointed out that the big reason Epic probably doesn’t think bringing
        <em>
         Fortnite
        </em>
        to Apple TV would be worth their time is that it would require a gaming controller, and most Apple TV owners don’t have one. Having played on the Switch for a bit tonight (I once finished 13th out of 100 — albeit with couch-side coaching from my son, who guided me to a house with a hidden
        <em>
         Lost
        </em>
        -esque bunker under the basement) there’s just no way this game could possibly be played using an Apple TV remote. It needs a lot of buttons. Apple’s blind spot for gaming on Apple TV is just baffling to me, especially given the prowess of their chip team. They’ve got the hard part down — CPU/GPU performance and developer support for iOS — but are completely missing out because they don’t ship a version of the hardware with a gaming controller.

        Alan Burdick, writing for The New Yorker:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The unsettling thing about spending two days at a convention of
 people who believe that Earth is flat isn’t the possibility that
 you, too, might come to accept their world view, although I did
 worry a little about that. Rather, it’s the very real likelihood
 that, after sitting through hours of presentations on “scientism,”
 lightning angels, and nasa’s many conspiracies — the moon-landing
 hoax, the International Fake Station, so-called satellites — and
 in chatting with I.T. specialists, cops, college students, and
 fashionably dressed families with young children, all of them
 unfailingly earnest and lovely, you will come to actually
 understand why a growing number of people are dead certain that
 Earth is flat. Because that truth is unnerving.

        In recent years I’ve begun to feel conflicted about the internet. On the one hand, it’s been wonderful in so many ways. I’ve personally built my entire career on the fact that the internet enables me to publish as a one-person operation. But on the other hand, before the internet, kooks were forced to exist on the fringe. There’ve always been flat-earther-types denying science and John Birch Society political fringers, but they had no means to amplify their message or bond into large movements.

           It seems to have been driven by the needs of the compiler and
 the gaps that needed to be filled for the static analyzer. Those
 seem to have been super-charged instead of catering to app
 developer’s actual needs: efficient, hassle free, productive

           It is meant to offer progressive disclosure and be simple, to be
 used in playgrounds and learning. At the same time learning and
 reading through the Swift book and standard library is more akin
 to mastering C++. It is quite unforgiving, harsh, and complex.

        This is a really thoughtful, measured take against Swift. I know a lot of developers love Swift, but I also know many who share similar misgivings about it, primarily that it isn’t optimized specifically for writing great apps.

 advantage of the location in which they claimed the franchise’s

 partied.

         Some say the sun doesn’t rise in Vegas. The Caps, led by their

         The threshold for who could venture on stage started to lower.
 Disbelief had yet to dissipate. “How amazing is it you can walk
 into a bar and the Stanley Cup is there, 10 yards away?” one
 Capitals employee asked, standing by the bar. He then escorted
 onto the stage a longtime Caps season-ticket holder who had gained
 entry, in part, by buying acceptable clothing off the back of a
 man on the street for 20 bucks. (He had previously been denied on
 the grounds of wearing sandals and shorts.)

        10 Strikes and You’re Out — the iOS Feature You’re Probably Not Using But Should
       </a>
      </h1>
      <h6 class="dateline">
       Thursday, 31 May 2018
      </h6>
      <p>
       For many years now, iOS has offered an option in the Passcode section of the Settings all: “Erase all data on this iPhone after 10 failed passcode attempts.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve long been intrigued by this setting, but never turned it on, out of the vague fear that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       could happen and I’d wind up with a wiped iPhone. Say, if a “friend” surreptitiously took my phone at a bar and entered 10 wrong passcodes as a prank. Something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1000140798632087553">
        I asked on Twitter over the weekend how many people use this feature
       </a>
       , and over 4,000 people responded to the poll. One-third use the feature, two-thirds don’t. Among those who don’t, the most common response, by far, is that they don’t use it because they’re the parents of young children, and they fear that their kids will trigger the erasure of their phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had no idea until I looked into it last weekend, but it turns out this feature is far more clever than I realized, and it’s highly unlikely that your kids or jackass drinking buddies could ever trigger it. After the 5th failed attempt, iOS requires a 1-minute timeout before you can try again. During this timeout the only thing you can do is place an emergency call to 911. After the 6th attempt, you get a 5-minute timeout. After the 7th, 15 minutes. These timeouts escalate such that it would take over 3 hours to enter 10 incorrect passcodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems pretty clear from the responses to my poll that I wasn’t alone in thinking that this feature was more dangerous than it really is. I’ve got it turned on now, and I can’t think of a good reason why anyone
       <em>
        wouldn’t
       </em>
       enable this.

        Yammering on One More Time Regarding Google’s Duplex Recordings
       </a>
      </h1>
      <h6 class="dateline">
       Tuesday, 22 May 2018
      </h6>
      <p>
       Let me just reiterate up front that
       <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/05/11/duplex-skepticism">
        my suspicions
       </a>
       surrounding Google’s Duplex recordings are not suspicions regarding the idea of Duplex itself. If I had to bet on who will be the first to create an AI voice system that passes for human, even within the limited constraints of a single well-defined task like booking reservations, it would be Google. If Vegas had a betting line on this, Amazon would probably have decent odds too, but surely Google would be the favorite.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can all hear for ourselves how well Google Assistant works today. I’m not alleging that these recordings are complete fabrications, or betting against Google being further ahead in this effort than anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       But everything about the way Google announced this — the
       <a href="https://www.axios.com/google-ai-demo-questions-9a57afad-9854-41da-b6e2-5e55b619283e.html">
        curious details of the calls
       </a>
       released so far, the fact that no one in the media has been allowed to see an actual call happen live — makes me suspect that for one or more reasons, the
       <em>
        current
       </em>
       state of Duplex is less than what Sundar Pichai implied on stage.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/ogfYd705cRs?t=35m9s">
        His words before the first recording was played
       </a>
       : “What you’re going to hear is the Google Assistant actually calling a real salon to schedule an appointment for you. Let’s listen.” And after the second recording: “Again, that was a real call.”
      </p>
      <p>
       You can parse those words precisely and argue that Pichai never said they were unscripted or un-coached, or that the recordings are unedited. But that’s like saying Bill Clinton was technically truthful with his “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” statement. The implication of Clinton’s statement was that he wasn’t involved sexually with his intern, and that wasn’t true. The implication of Pichai’s statement was that right now, today, Google has a version of Duplex in its lab that can call a real restaurant or hair salon and book a reservation and sound truly human while doing so. Not soon, today. Look at the news coverage from the announcement —
       <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/05/09/google-assistant-phone-call/">
        Mashable
       </a>

       <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/googles-robot-assistant-can-now-make-phone-calls-on-your-behalf-a3833826.html">
        The Evening Standard
       </a>
       — all of those reports on Duplex’s announcement are written in the present tense, as though it’s something Google has working, as heard, with no or very minimal editing, today.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a few months or more from now Google can demonstrate a real Duplex call, live, that wouldn’t disprove my suspicion that they can’t do it right now in May 2018 — even though Sundar Pichai clearly implied last week that they can. If I’m wrong — if stories come out in the next week or two from journalists granted behind-the-scenes access to listen to Duplex make live calls (and watch them be parsed correctly, creating calendar events and notifications of the reservation dates and times), and those calls sound every bit as realistically human as the recordings Google has released so far — my suspicion will be proven false. And I’d be delighted by that. Part of the reason I’m so focused on Duplex is that if it really works like it does in these recordings, it’s one of the most amazing advances in technology in years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Google hasn’t done that, and the more I think about it, and the longer Google stonewalls on press inquiries about Duplex, the more suspicious I get that they can’t. Even if Duplex still has a low success rate, it would be amazing if, say, half its calls worked as well and sounded as good as these recordings. That would be perfectly understandable for a technology still in development.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Pichai also said “This will be rolling out in the coming weeks as an experiment.” On the one hand, that makes me feel like maybe I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       off my rocker for being so skeptical. Why in the world would Pichai say that if they weren’t at a stage in internal testing where Duplex works as the recordings suggest? But on the other hand, if they are that close, why haven’t they invited anyone from the media to see Duplex in action?
      </p>
      <p>
       They did invite Richard Nieva from CNet to a behind-the-scenes preview before I/O,
       <a href="https://www.cnet.com/features/google-assistant-duplex-at-io-could-become-the-most-lifelike-ai-voice-assistant-yet/">
        but all he got to hear were recordings, too
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a building called the Partnerplex on Google’s sprawling
 campus in Mountain View, California, I’ve been invited to hear a
 51-second phone recording of someone making a dinner
 reservation. […]
       </p>
       <p>
        As I listen to what sounds like a man and a woman talking,
 Google’s top executives for Assistant, the search giant’s digital
 helper, watch closely to gauge my reaction. They’re showing off
 the Assistant’s new tricks a few days before Google I/O, the
 company’s annual developer conference that starts Tuesday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turns out this particular trick is pretty wild.
       </p>
       <p>
        That’s because Person 2, the one who sounds like a man, isn’t a
 person at all. It’s the Google Assistant.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why not let Nieva hear it live? Why not let Nieva answer the phone and book the reservation himself, as though he works at the restaurant? If it’s “weeks” away from rolling out in a limited beta to the public, that should be possible.
      </p>

       “How did you do this?” is a necessary question. But even broader, when you’re only shown a recording, the question is “How do we know this is real?”

      <p>
       Maybe Duplex, today, works just as well and sounds just as human as these recordings suggest. But maybe it doesn’t work as well as they claimed, or doesn’t sound so human,

       or takes pauses that were edited out of the clips they’ve released. We don’t know, because Google hasn’t allowed anyone to verify anything about it. It’s like a card trick where the magician, rather than an audience member, picks the card and shuffles the deck.

       It’s the difference between, say, watching video of a purported self-driving car versus watching — or even better, riding as a passenger in — an actual self-driving car.
      </p>
      <p>
       The headlines last week should have been along the lines of “Google
       <em>
        Claims
       </em>
       Assistant Can Make Human-Sounding Phone Calls”, not “Google Assistant Can Make Human-Sounding Phone Calls”. There’s a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recording is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a demo. You can demo hardware and software that isn’t shipping yet — most companies do, because that’s when the products are still under wraps and can make for a surprise. But there’s an obligation to be clear about the current state of the product, and to demo what you currently have working “for real”. Showing it privately to select members of the media is another acceptable strategy. Just to cite one famous example from Apple: in January 2007 the original iPhone was six months away from shipping and still needed a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of work. But what Steve Jobs showed on stage was real — early stage software running on prototype hardware. Everything demoed was live, not a recording. And then to further prove that, after the keynote, select members of the media, including

        David Pogue

       , got up to 45 minutes of actual hands on time with a prototype, even though the software was at such an early stage that some of the default apps
       <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/some-hands-on-time-with-the-iphone/">
        only showed screenshots of what they were supposed to look like

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s how you prove to the world that a demo was what you said it was. It is damn curious that Google won’t do that with Duplex.

It seems clear that they only started thinking about disclosing Duplex as a bot to humans in response to the ethical outcry after the keynote. Ethics aside though, what makes the promise of Duplex so tantalizing as a technology is its seeming humanness.

        The image
       </a>
       is cropped somewhat tightly, but they’re clearly eating Chinese food, the bench style and wall color are distinctive, and there’s a large picture hanging over their heads. So, I did the laziest thing I could possibly do:

       My thanks to Jay P and everyone else who contributed to the thread on Twitter. Jay deserves the credit for cracking this, by going backwards from the Masu Sushi sign in the reflection.

       All I did was ask. The fact that I had an answer to my question in just 22 minutes shows that having a large follower count on Twitter is a bit of a super power. I honestly can’t think of another way to answer this question without Google PR’s help. I suppose, without Twitter, I could have just posted the question on Daring Fireball, and I might have gotten the same answer. But the threaded, public, instant nature of Twitter allowed for multiple people to contribute — we went from “
       <em>
        this might be the place
       </em>
       ” to “
       <em>
        this is definitely the place
       </em>
       ” in just a handful of minutes. Remarkable, really.

          One weird detail is that the image from Google of the engineers
          <a href="https://twitter.com/FlorianGallwitz/status/997210374108786693">
           has been flipped horizontally
          </a>
          , so the reflection of the neighboring restaurant’s sign isn’t mirrored. My only guess as to why Google flipped this image is that they wanted Leviathan, the project lead, to have his name listed first in the caption.
