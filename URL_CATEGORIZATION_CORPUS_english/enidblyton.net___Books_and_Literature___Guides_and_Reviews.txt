       <p>
        This is easily the most asked question about our beloved author, and it's amazing how many different answers there are. The truth is, it depends on what you mean by "book." Do you mean novels? Short story compilations? Character books? Non-fiction nature books? The following numbers are shamelessly borrowed from the Enid Blyton Society's database and updated real-time.

          Two messages that refer to 'Enid Blyton - The Untold Story' could leave those who've contributed to the 'Gofundme' facility feeling a little impatient. 1."The only thing to report now is that the typescript for 'Enid Blyton - The Untold Story' is fully completed and awaiting publication." (Dated 2013). 2."The book is now finally completed from cover to cover and is expected to be published sometime in February, 2018 by Bloomsfield Publishing. Update: Because the process took longer than expected, the publication date provisionally announced as February, 2018 is now carried forward to sometime in May or June 2018." (Dated 2018?). Incidentally the 'Gofundme' page for 'EnidBlytonbio' is no longer there! When it existed, the following 'Supplementary Information' informed fans thus: "In the Gofundme crowdfunding website, I launched a pitch to raise £20,000 to create an enterprise to self-publish my book: Enid Blyton - The Untold Story. The name of the enterprise to be created is: Bloomsfield Publishing" - and it goes on to illustrate how the money will be used (this contains about fifteen headings) and will also cover "Commissioning a reputable independent Publishing Services Provider in London to prepare the book for publication. Copies of the typescript have been sent to Chorion (now Hachette) and also to the Enid Blyton Society." Further info: "The entire process - from dust jacket design to printing - should take between six to eight months, as opposed to waiting years for my name to move up the publisher's list." That sentence prompts a question because the number of years he wouldn't like to wait is not specified. (Dated 2013) Five so far.

          </b>
          My entire childhood is reading Enid Blyton. My first book was The Mountain of Adventure. Every book, every story, took me on a journey outside of myself and into a world peopled with the inimitable Blyton characters. My favourite series are - Famous Five, Secret Seven, the Adventure series and Noddy. My favourite character is and always will be George, along with faithful old Timmy. There was a time when I actually believed they were real and when I was cruelly disabused of that notion, I remember looking up into the clouds and thinking - 'that's where they are, they will always be there'. I love George and Famous Five and everything Enid Blyton, I miss my childhood that was laced with such gorgeous reading. It's a place that will remain untarnished.

          On May 18th, 2018: Allison asked, 'Could you tell me what plants were mentioned in the Adventures of Pip? ' No one's answered yet, although why the question was asked is anyone's guess. Here's a list: Blackberry, Bluebell, Buttercup, Catkin, Clematis, Corn, Dock (Rumex?), Foxglove, Gooseberry, Holly, Ivy, Mistletoe, Nettles, Poppy, Pussy Willow, Primrose, Rose, Scarlet Pimpernel, Shepherd's Purse, Toadstool. The Sea Anemone is down as a 'queer flower,' and a few trees are mentioned. Wonder if we'll be informed as to why this particular inventory is required?

          Can someone advise what year the disastrous PC revisions have been made to Enid Blyon's books? My first child is now just old enough to start reading The Enchanted Wood, and and I find out they've been butchered. There's not even the option to buy it uncensored! Are we burning books next? I'm a bit cranky. Can anyone give more info on publishing dates that are safe? I'll buy second hand.

           I'm not sure when some of the books were updated to make them more PC of today, Justme, but you can still buy the original books from second hand book shops and many are on Ebay and Abe Books.  I do hope you can find the books you are looking for.

           I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that one, so I'm hoping that someone else reading your question can help you, Allison.

          Greetings from Russia. Liked to read Enid Blyton books in childhood, especially The Five Find-Outers Series and it was so cool to find these books in the original language and re-read them again now. and could you please suggest, if there is a Museum or kind of special place should be visited by Enid fan during UK visit?

           Enid lived in various homes as an author. The most famous ones are Old Thatch in Bourne End.  You can still see the cottage but sadly you can't visit inside the garden as it is a private residence.  Enid then moved to Green Hedges over in Beaconsfield, but again sadly the house was demolished but you can visit where it once stood in Enid Blyton Close.  If you visit the model village there in Beaconsfield, there is a model of Enid's once house - Green Hedges.  If you want to read more about Enid and where she lived as a child, you can visit our sister site and read all about Enid in the section - Author of Adventure.

          There's an official site aimed at kids about Enid run by Hachette who control most of her works (sans Noddy).

          Wow. It's been years since I've visited this site. I can't imagine what life would be like without Enid Blyton's books- especially all the adventure and mystery ones. They're my greatest inspiration. The first set of books I've read are The Five Find-Outers Series. I was obsessed over Fatty's awesome disguise skills and every other character of the book. I can't think how much Enid Blyton's books have helped me: They've led to me writing my first full length novel, they've encouraged me to be happy. It's awesome. I still do come back and re read all of these books, though now I'm COMPLETELY obsessed over Harry Potter. Anyways. From Nithya, 15 years old, from India.

          I live in the central north of Tasmania and the demographics of the area are about 30-40 years older than I am. It's a retirement home disguised as a small town.

           Paul obviously knows little about village life in England! Having said that, I agree that school life has no place in Enchanted Wood stories.

          Also a village school would be much more boring than a town or suburban school. Going to school is like asking if characters spend a penny - it's not important to the story so it doesn't come up!

          True Fatty! Much more interesting things to learn in the lands at the top of the Faraway Tree than going to school! No talk of ever inviting friends from school to come and visit. So maybe Jo, Bessie and Fanny are home schooled!
