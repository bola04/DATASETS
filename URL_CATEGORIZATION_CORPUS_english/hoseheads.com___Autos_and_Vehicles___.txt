         Dismal conditions and a predicted 90% 
 			chance of multiple rain showers between the hours of 5 pm and 11 pm 
 			has forced Port Royal Speedway to cancel its June 23 racing program. 
 			The decision was made after consultation with National Weather 
 			Service meteorologists in State College. There will be no make-up 
 			date for Fire and Rescue EMS Night. The speedway will be back in 
 			action next Saturday, June 30 at 7 pm with a big program of 358 
 			sprints, super late models, econo late models and 305 sprints. Make 
 			up features will be run for the econo lates and 305 sprints to go 
 			along with full programs of racing action for all divisions. The 358 
 			sprints will be on hand as part of the 2018 K1 RaceGear Summer 
 			Series. It will be the first show at Port Royal for the 358 sprints 
 			in several seasons. June 30 will also be Camera &amp; Autograph Night at 
 			the track with general admission ticket holders granted access to 
 			the pit area from 430 - 6 pm. 6/23

         Claud Estes III took an early lead after 
 			top points getter Dalton Steed spun on the ultra-slick surface (it 
 			was 100 degrees and pretty windy all day). Wester would continue to 
 			advance from his 6th place starting spot and began stalking Estes at 
 			the mid-point where he would overtake the top spot and cruise on to 
 			the checkers. Claud Estes III would hold on to finish in 2nd, while 
 			it was a real banner night for the Estes Gang, as Claud's nephhew 
 			D.J. would finish 3rd and Sprint Car Bandits points leader Colby 
 			Estes would come home 5th. Ryan Hall, driving the Valvoline Express 
 			Care of Seagoville #79 would finish a solid 4th place.

 			event will pay a minimum of $3,000-to-win and $400-to-start.

         Brian Montieth has a knack for winning at 
 			the right time, especially at Lincoln Speedway. Montieth, sporting 
 			the Sterner Cement Car Colors and number in honor of the race’s 
 			namesake, grabbed the lead from his outside frontrow starting 
 			position at the drop of the green and masterfully drove through 
 			lapped traffic most of the way to register his 58th career win in 
 			the $6,900-to-win 33-lap 15th Annual Weldon Sterner Memorial.

 			The big winners were Clinton Boyles (non-wing sprints); Stratton
