            My apologies for the recent two week or so website outage, as I was working through some coding upgrades due to changes from my service provider. Everything should now be back to normal - let me know if you notice any problems.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            All that said, as we approach the 10th anniversary of the opening of the CGW Museum, I am reminded that it runs on a rather old code base (itself borrowed from a friend's application, as I'm not that proficient with PHP!). Furthermore, it would also be great to update the look of the site. Is there anyone out there able and willing to help with developing a new site for the Museum? If so, please send me a note!

            Happy New Year to all CGW Museum visitors. As you have likely noticed, there hasn't been a whole lot of change here since mid-2012. Honestly, with the completion of scanning the entire CGW run, there isn't likely to be a whole lot of change in the future either! Perhaps at some point I'll add the GFW issues, but otherwise, unless someone comes up with some interesting new information about CGW... there isn't a whole lot more to add. That said, the magazines will remain available as valuable digital resources! And if you do have ideas or information that might be useful, well, please e-mail! Have a great 2014!

            I've just received the sad news that after a nearly two year battle with pancreatic cancer, Tim Finkas, the original cover artist, graphic designer, and layout editor of CGW has passed away. Tim created every cover of CGW up to #26, with the exception of 4.4, 5.5, and 25. You may remember
            <a href="http://cgwmuseum.org/columns/index.php?id=2">
             this interview
            </a>
            that I did with Tim nearly ten years ago, in which he explains his start with the magazine, his thoughts on many of the covers, and much more. If you've already read it, it's worth another look, and if you haven't, you're missing out on some very interesting CGW material - head on over for a read.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Our thoughts are with his family in these difficult times. Thanks Tim, for your friendliness, creativity, and amazing talent.
