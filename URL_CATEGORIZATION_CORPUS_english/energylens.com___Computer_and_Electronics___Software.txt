       It only took a couple of clicks to load the data into Energy Lens, and in practically no time at all I was extracting useful information and trends.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ability to form charts and tables quickly and easily, producing meaningful trends in energy use undoubtedly saved me many hours of tedious, complicated Excel manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In our increasingly environmentally conscious world, with spiralling energy costs, it is more important than ever to monitor energy use and to work to reduce it.  Energy Lens makes this process much easier, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone or any business that has access to the necessary energy data.

       Detailed electricity usage data is often available to clients.  But they are generally overawed by the sheer amount of data.  Even with experience, little can be gleaned without considerable time in Excel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I downloaded Energy Lens to see if it would help.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a difference.  Now, within minutes, I can get a quick overview of every day of the year, and from there zoom in to identify peak loads, overnight wastage, and just plain odd occurrences.
      </p>
      <p>
       One client had recently changed some settings on their lighting control system, but didn't know how much it had saved.  After a few minutes with Energy Lens, I showed that they were saving over 20% of their original usage.  Had they not already made the changes, the analysis would have identified the potential, as their high out-of-hours usage was clear from the graphs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say the client was very impressed and was also keen to get the software for themselves.

     Energy Lens is a tool for charting and analyzing energy consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
     Energy Lens is used to monitor and manage energy use by energy managers, facilities managers, and the energy consultants and building-services engineers advising them.
    </p>
    <p>
     This software was designed and built on a simple premise: You can only start to
     <strong>
      <em>
       save
      </em>
     </strong>
     energy when you clearly
     <strong>
      <em>
       see
      </em>
     </strong>
     how you're using it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Energy Lens seamlessly plugs in to Excel.  It turns detailed, raw energy-consumption data into useful charts and figures.
     </strong>
     You can use these charts and figures to visually identify:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      When and where you're wasting energy
     </li>
     <li>
      How much energy is being wasted
     </li>
     <li>
      Progress made in reducing energy consumption
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Trying to save energy without seeing this information is a bit like trying to get somewhere in a strange city without any road signs or maps: It'll take much longer, you'll miss the easy shortcuts, and you'll never really know how far you've gone or how far you've left to go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Visually analyzing your energy-consumption data helps you to figure out where to start your energy-saving efforts, where to go next, and how to monitor ongoing progress.  It creates the core of all serious energy-saving efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Conceptually
     </em>
     it's a simple process.  However, doing this analysis manually (or using only Excel) tends to get complicated, and the tedious data manipulation takes up precious time...time that could be better spent doing something a computer
     <em>
      can't
     </em>
     do for you.
    </p>
    <p>
     The value in energy management software analysis is clear.  The extra value you'll receive from using Energy Lens is an ongoing savings in time, efficiency and overhead costs, as well as a much higher throughput of detailed analysis than comparable software offers.
    </p>
    <p class="subhead">
     Energy Lens is Clearly Different from Comparable Energy Management Software
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      It's
      <em>
       not
      </em>
      a super-advanced system that requires complicated installation and training.
     </li>
     <li>
      It
      <em>
       doesn't
      </em>
      have a million different report templates to navigate and understand.
     </li>
     <li>
      You
      <em>
       can't
      </em>
      configure it to pester people with automated alarms:
      <em>
       "Beep Beep! Someone's left the lights on on Floor 3!  Code Blue!"
      </em>
     </li>
     <li>
      It
      <em>
       won't
      </em>
      help you to check your building's energy consumption using your mobile phone from a beach in the Caribbean.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     No,
     <strong>
      Energy Lens is a simple
      <em>
       Excel add-in
      </em>
      that makes it easy to visually analyze detailed energy data
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But don't let the quick installation and simple interface fool you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the hood is a powerful and unique Excel add-in, with advanced analysis features you won't find in many high-end energy management software packages.
    </p>
    <p>
     But using it effectively is
     <em>
      far
     </em>
     from rocket science.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      You don't need a rigorous training course.
     </strong>
     Instead, we have compiled some
     <a href="http://www.energylens.com/videos/">
      quick online training videos
     </a>
     to help answer common questions and walk you through the initial paces.  But this software is intuitive and easy to understand, right out of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Here's how it works
     </strong>
     : You give Energy Lens your energy data.  Energy Lens displays a set of carefully-crafted analysis features to help you turn that data into useful charts and figures that are specific to your analytic and reporting needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Energy Lens works completely within Excel, you can seamlessly connect Energy Lens with your existing procedures, and build upon its outputs with further analysis of your own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many people have found everything they need in the Excel charts and tables that Energy Lens generates.  However, if you want to create a chart that Energy Lens doesn't offer as a point-and-click option, you'll usually find that Energy Lens can generate a table of figures that gets you started.

       What is Interval Energy Data?
      </h2>
      <p>
       It's a detailed record of energy usage that comes from automated meter readings made at regular intervals such as every 15-minutes or half hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.energylens.com/interval-data">

      </p>

    <p>
     Many energy management software packages focus on statistical analysis techniques to squeeze value out of low-resolution monthly meter readings.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Energy Lens focuses exclusively on the analysis of modern, high-resolution interval energy data
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The detail of interval energy data makes manual analysis a chore, but that's not a problem if you're using Energy Lens.  And interval data contains over 1000 times the detail of monthly meter readings, making analysis of this data exponentially more valuable for energy-management purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some organizations have this data available, and yet are still struggling to get useful energy-usage information from the old-school data-analysis techniques.  Most organizations will make much greater progress in significantly less time through analyzing interval data.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      <em>
       "But what about the meter readings I've been taking?"
      </em>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you
     <em>
      don't
     </em>
     have interval metering or the budget to invest in it, your only option is to read your meters manually, analyzing the data using traditional monitoring-and-targeting methods.
     <span id="mandt">
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Even with detailed interval data to analyze, it might make sense to do some traditional M&amp;T as well. Energy Lens helps with this by automatically turning your interval data into accurate weekly or monthly totals, freeing you from the chore of personally reading the meters.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Simple Fact:
     </strong>
     No amount of time spent analyzing weekly or monthly figures will reveal the patterns and energy-saving opportunities detailed interval data displays in
     <strong>
      <em>
       seconds
      </em>
     </strong>
     .
