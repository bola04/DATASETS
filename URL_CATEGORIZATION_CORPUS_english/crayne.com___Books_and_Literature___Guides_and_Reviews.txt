       Jake Dani wakes on Earth to find that everything he knew had changed. Gone were his clothes and his comm. Everyone he knew had attended his funeral. His girlfriend, Gancha, was wanted for murder. His friend Deek was suspended from the police department for tampering with evidence that Jake had provided. The Binger colony being setup in Telmot was in danger from the bigotry of anti-Bingers. His best buddy Ron had been killed. And a coup was being planned to take over the government of his adopted hometown. To top it all off, his nemesis wanted him deadand was powerful enough to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while Jake was a prisoner on Earth.

       Jake gets a call from his girlfriend Mimi after her arrest for protesting
