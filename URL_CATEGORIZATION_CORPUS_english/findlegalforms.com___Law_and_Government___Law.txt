        <li>
         <a href="#">
          Do I need special software to download or view the documents?
         </a>
         <div class="answer">
          No.  Standard computer software will allow you to download the forms.  In addition, we will send you an email with download links should you need to download your forms on another device.  Almost all the documents are provided in multiple formats including PDF, Word, and RTF - ensuring that you will be able to view and edit the document.
         </div>
        </li>
        <li>
         <a href="#">
          Can I use the form more than once?
         </a>
         <div class="answer">
          Yes.  You can use the forms for your personal or business use as many times as you wish.  You may not, however, redistribute or resell the forms without the permission of FindLegalForms.com.
         </div>
        </li>
        <li>
         <a href="#">
          When can I download my form?
         </a>
         <div class="answer">
          Immediately. As soon as your payment is processed you will be taken to a "Thank You" page which contains the download links for the forms that you ordered.
