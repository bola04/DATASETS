 find my rantings interesting in a sort of drug induced coma sort of way. Who am I to deny people their dosage of endorphins?  So 
 we will see. If the traffic and feedback indicate I may actually update this once in a while.</p>

     <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>01JAN07</b> - Lopht.com Lives! 
 Unfortunately with an Oh and not a zero, but we will take what we can get. Amazing what a spammer will pay for 
 a half decent domain. Or I suppose you could say it is amazing what someone will pay to recapture the past. Either way, 
 expensive. <a 
 href="http://www.lopht.com">lopht.com</a> is back online. </font>
 <p>
 <p> 
     <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>17DEC06</b> - Dildog threw his annual 
 Christmas bash with all of the usual suspects and a few unusual ones. Tame by L0pht party standards but hey, we're all gettin' 
 old. The Vegtable of Death actually stopped looking for dead people long enough to grace us with his presence. The Fish of 
 Tweet was still 5K miles away but still thought of. Mudge had his new girly girl and I don't think I saw a drink in his hand
 all night, WOW!</font>
 <p>
 <p>
     <font face<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>10NOV06</b> - Amazing what you can find in 
 your own website log files. Very surprising to see who is reading this site. Hi out there, I see you!</font>
 <p> 
 
     <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>17SEP06</b> - So one of the few tech reporters who 
 'gets it', Ted Bridis, over at the AP decides he needs a quote for a <a 
 href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/NWsbA9HlQtAc6Q/Used-Cell-Phones-May-Reveal-First-Owners-Personal-Data.xhtml">story</a> 
 about how old cell phones may still have data on them from their original owners. So he finds Mudge, and what does he say? "I'd 
 run over the phone..." Bwhahahaha!!!!.  Well, I thought it was funny anyway.</font>
 <p>
     <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>23AUG06</b> - Not a lot of people know where the 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0pht">L0pht</a> was physically.  It started out in an old artists co-op building near 
 South Boston and then moved to an old warehouse in Watertown. If you were lucky enough to attend one of the orginal legendary L0pht 
 parties you would not recognise either building now. The South End location has been remodeled into very trendy <a 
 href="http://www.useaboston.com/">artist open studios</a> While the Watertwon building was torn down shortly after we moved out 
 and in its place a biotech lab building was built. During the bio-tech slowdown they <a 
 href="http://www.boston.com/realestate/news/articles/2005/12/11/lab_space_revamped_as_loft_condos/">converted</a> the unused 
 building into loft (haha) condos, the project is called <a href="http://www.riverbanklofts.com/index.htm">RiverBank Condos</a> and 
 they are selling for about $400K each.</font> 
     <p>
     <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>08AUG06</b> - Blackhat and Defcon were as trippy as I 
 thought it would be. Rather tame by Defcon standards but then I think they say that every year. Not much in the way of 
 muli-colored hair or scantily clad women, but definately more women than I remember. KP was pimpin' out the <a 
 href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/08/defcon_badge_hacking_contest_p.html">Defcon badge</a> which I must 
 say was pretty cool. Had a beer or two with Jericho at the Silohette bar at Ceasers and talked about his work on the <a 
 href="http://www.osvdb.org/">OSVDB.</a> and of course reminised about the old HNN days. It was good see Tan, although some of the 
 stories he told me about what he has been up to over the last few years were scary to say the least, still good to diss the old 
 @Snake fiasco. And of course Mudge, still drunk, not sure if things will ever be the same there but at least we're talking. 
 Unfortunately other people can't seem to deal with the real world and like to pretend it doesn't exist, whatever. I just wanted 
 to say hi. </font>
     <p>
     <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>19JUL06</b> - I see that Spaceronics will live a long 
 and illustrious life. Long Live Spaceronics! (Please, don't ask, or I will be forced to tell you the Bangkok story.)</font>
     <p>
     <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>17JUL06</b> - OK, so now that I am blogging, not 
 that I wasn't blogging before they called it blogging, what the hell do I write about? HOPE is coming up but I doubt I 
 will be in attendance, to much work. I may head off to Defcon this year, that will be a trip. Been five years or so since 
 I have seen any of those folks. <p> If anyone asks me to create a MySpace page I will seriously bitch slap them.</font>
