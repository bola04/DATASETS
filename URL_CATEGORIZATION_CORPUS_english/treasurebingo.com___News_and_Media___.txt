     <strong>
      FULL TERMS:
     </strong>
     <ol>
      <li>
       The promotion is ongoing, currently without an end date. We will provide reasonable notice of when it will come to an end.
      </li>
      <li>
       The offer is for 18+ non-funded players only.
      </li>
      <li>
       This offer may not be combined with any other offer.
      </li>
      <li>
       In order to qualify for the 300% Welcome bingo bonus, you must deposit a minimum of £5. No promo code required.
      </li>
      <li>
       The Welcome bingo bonus is 300% of your deposit. The maximum total bonus funds you can receive from the promotion is £60.
      </li>
      <li>
       The offer is limited to a player’s first deposit and therefore is only valid once per player.
      </li>
      <li>
       The bonus will be credited in bingo bonus funds to your bingo bonus bankroll. Bingo bonus funds cannot be converted to real money and can only be used to buy additional bingo cards.
      </li>
      <li>
       Real money winnings generated as a result of purchases of bingo cards will be credited to your real money bankroll. Bingo bonus winnings generated as a result of purchases of bingo cards will be credited to your bingo bonus bankroll.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you request a withdrawal from your real money bankroll before fulfilling the following wagering requirements you will lose all bingo bonus funds: you must wager 4x the amount of your deposit used to redeem the bingo bonus plus 4x the bingo bonus funds received from that deposit (for example, if you deposit £10 and get a £30 bingo bonus, you must wager £160).
      </li>
      <li>
       Wagering must be done on bingo games only and only wagering with bingo bonus funds will count towards the wagering requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
       Wagering order: when purchasing a bingo card, real money funds will always be used before bingo bonus funds.
      </li>
      <li>
       Withdrawing funds: The amount you are able to withdraw from your account is subject to a minimum of £5. If your withdrawal request is for less than £5, the amount you have requested to withdraw will be returned to your Bankroll. You can find more details about our withdrawal limits in our

         <p>

         <h4>
          Can I pre-purchase cards?
         </h4>
         <p>
          Yes! Cards can be purchased up to one month in advance for our guaranteed jackpots. Once you have bought your cards they will be stored until the game is played.
         </p>
         <h4>
          Can I keep my card numbers from game to game?
         </h4>
         <p>
          Unfortunately not. To keep things fair, all cards are randomly generated at the time you request them. If you do not like the numbers of your issued cards, you can click on Get New Cards to get a better batch.

Whether it's the bingo ball selection, a roll of a dice, a hand of cards, or a spin of the wheel, in each event a Random Number Generator (RNG) is utilized to ensure that the outcome is random. The system has been rigorously tested by running millions of rounds and examining their results. The system is also systematically tested by Treasure Bingo.

          Getting Started
         </h1>
         <h3>
          Start a game
         </h3>
         <p>
          Click on any Play button to play and join in the fun with Treasure Bingo. The bingo lobby area will load, where you'll find a huge variety of games to choose from including FREE bingo, 5p bingo, 10p bingo, guaranteed jackpots and instant games.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Choosing a game
         </h3>
         <p>
          Once you're in lobby area you will be able to choose from a whole host of games. The bingo games are separated by tabs in the lobby, so all you have to do is choose what type of game and bingo you want to play and then click on the tab.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Each ticket shows the price of the card, what type of bingo (75 ball or 90 ball), when the next game will begin, how many players are in the room and if the room has a chat host.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Buying cards
         </h3>
         <p>
          24 randomly generated bingo tickets will be displayed on the screen in batches of six tickets at a time. To scroll through the tickets, use the left and right arrow buttons at the top left of the card display area.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The current batch will be shown in the left navigation panel, for example, 'cards 7-12 of 24'. To select or deselect a card, simply click on the card. The number of cards that you have selected will also be displayed on the navigation panel. You can choose different cards by clicking the 'GET NEW CARDS' button at the top of the card display area.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This will provide you with a set of 24 new randomly generated unselected cards.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You can auto-select card in batches of 6, 12, 18, 24 or the maximum number of cards, this means you don't have to click on each card.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Once you are happy with your selected cards, click on the 'BUY SELECTED CARDS' button situated on the left of the screen. Subject to funds, this will complete your card purchase. Please note that card purchases are non-refundable and all sales are final. The navigation panel also displays the number of cards you have purchased for the next game.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Each purchased card will display a number at the bottom of the card, for example, 122235761. This number is a reference for both yourself and our customer services team. You have until 10 seconds prior to the start of next game to purchase bingo cards for that game.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You can pre-buy cards to some of our jackpot games. To get your cards in advance, enter the room and purchase your cards the same way you'd buy into a normal game. At the top of the screen you will find the number of players, jackpot and time remaining until the game starts. The game name and card to complete is displayed at the top.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Playing bingo
         </h3>
         <p>
          The screen will announce when a game is about to begin. The room shows the cards you have purchased in batches of 6. You can scroll between your cards by clicking the left and right arrow buttons above the cards. The current batch of cards is also displayed as, for example, 'cards 1-12 of 24'.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You can see how many people have bought into the game and the jackpot amount at the top of the screen. You can choose to display from 3TG by clicking the 'OPTIONS' menu at the top and selecting the 'In Game' option. Then you can tick "Show 3TG". This shows when you have three numbers to go before your card has been completed a BINGO! After being selected, all cards with 3, 2 or 1 number to go will be indicated.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In order to select Autodaub, simply click on the 'OPTIONS' menu at the top of the card display area and selecting the 'In Game' option.  Then you can tick 'Autodaub'. When it's on, the game automatically marks or "daubs" your card every time your numbers are called out so you don't have to! When this button is off, your card numbers are not automatically daubed, so you can mark them manually by clicking the number on the card.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Called numbers are marked in white if they form part of the required Bingo pattern for the current game played. Bear in mind that whether you daub the numbers or not, and how you daub them has no effect on the game outcome. IF YOU HAVE A WINNING BINGO CARD YOU WILL WIN!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          When the game starts, a slight pause will occur before the balls are called out. After being randomly drawn, the balls are shown at the top left of the screen, accompanied by a voice announcing the numbers if you have your sound switched on. Each ball called is displayed on the bingo board, and the last 5 calls are displayed to the left.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          At the end of the game, "BINGO!" will be announced and the winning alias(es) will be presented. When you win, your winnings will automatically be added. You will then automatically be shown the next game screen after a short time, or after you click "OK".
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A few other things to note - you can alternate between having the sound on and off. Simply click on the sound icon in the top right hand section of the screen. If you need any assistance during the game, click on '?' in the top right hand section of the screen. Once you have finished playing bingo then simply click 'x' in the top right hand corner to exit.

In the event that we decommission a jackpot across all of our brands before it is won and the game concerned is also offered to players who play in the UK, we may either: (i) use any outstanding contributions (from both UK and non-UK players) to fund a separate progressive jackpot which UK players are eligible to win; (ii) use any outstanding contributions from UK players to fund a separate progressive jackpot which only UK players are eligible to win; or (iii) refund UK players the amount of their outstanding contributions.

               How will I receive funds once I have requested a withdrawal?
              </strong>
              <p>
               How we pay you requested amounts will depend on the payment method(s) used by you previously to make deposit(s) and the amounts that you have deposited using those payment method(s).
              </p>
              <p>
               Your "Transaction Balance" for each payment method (other than those detailed in 'Are there any deposit methods that do not have a Transaction Balance?') is the total sum that you have deposited into your account via that method, less any previous withdrawals and/or refunds made to the same payment method, measured over the past 4 months. When you request a withdrawal of more than your total Transaction Balance (aggregated across all relevant payment methods), the remainder is what we call the "Remaining Withdrawal Balance". For example, if you deposited £/$/€300 in total and requested to withdraw £/$/€450, your Transaction Balance would be £/$/€300 and your Remaining Withdrawal Balance would be £/$/€150.
              </p>
              <p>
               When you request a withdrawal, amounts equaling the Transaction Balance of each payment method will be paid automatically to the applicable payment method(s). Your Remaining Withdrawal Balance will be paid to the payment method you select from those available in the withdrawal page in the cashier.
              </p>
              By way of example, if on:
              <br/>
              <ul>
               <li>
                Monday you deposited £/$/€100 by Visa credit card;
               </li>
               <li>
                Tuesday you deposited £/$/€50 by Entropay;
               </li>
               <li>
                Wednesday you deposited another £/$/€50 by Visa credit card;

              </ul>
              <p>
               your total Transaction Balance would equal £/$/€300, which would be allocated to each payment method as follows:

              <ul>
               <li>
                the Transaction Balance of your Visa credit card would be £/$/€150;
               </li>
               <li>
                the Transaction Balance of your Entropay account would £/$/€50;
               </li>
               <li>
                the Transaction Balance of your Neteller account would be £/$/€50;

               <li>
                the Transaction Balance of your PayPal account would be £/$/€50; and

              </ul>
              <p>
               If on Sunday you requested a withdrawal of £/$/€450, then the first £/$/€300 of this amount (the Transaction Balance) would be paid automatically to the applicable payment method as follows:

              <ul>
               <li>
                £/$/€150 to your Visa credit card;

                £/$/€50 to your Entropay account;

         Protection of minors
        </h3>
        <p>
         In line with the Government of Gibraltar's Gaming Ordinance and UK Gambling Act, The Company does not allow anyone under the age of 18 to play on the Site (as defined in the User Agreement).
        </p>
        <p>
         The Site is not designed to attract children or adolescents. We actively discourage and track persons under the age of 18 who attempt to play at the Site. We use sophisticated verification systems which can identify minors who log in to our software.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, we recognise that the internet is readily accessible in many homes around the world. As a result, gaming companies and parents must work together to protect children from underage gaming. To ensure the safety of your children, we recommend installing filtering software to block minors from accessing certain websites and programs.

        <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 14px;">
         <li>
          Do not leave children unattended near your computer when the Site is running. You must take special care to ensure that they do not access our services via your devices.
         </li>
         <li>
          Protect your gaming programs with password access.
         </li>
         <li>
          Do not allow persons under 18 to participate in any gaming activity.
         </li>
         <li>
          Keep your username, password and deposit method details out of the reach of children.
         </li>
         <li>
          Educate your children about the legality and the potential damage of underage gaming.
         </li>
         <li>
          Limit the length of time your children spend online.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, no system is foolproof. If you know a person under the age of 18 who is registered with the Company, please notify our Operations Department at operations@cassava.net.

         Preventing Compulsive Gaming
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Company recognises that while most people play for entertainment, a small number of people can become obsessed with the potential monetary gains our games offer. Even though studies suggest that only a very small percentage of the adult population encounters compulsive gaming problems we take this matter exceedingly seriously and have accordingly implemented a number of measures to address this problem:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px; list-style-type:decimal; margin-left: 14px;">
         <li>
          The Company's training program incorporates methods and techniques that assist our employees in recognising and taking appropriate actions when they identify compulsive or underage gaming.
         </li>
         <li>
          We have implemented an easy to use self-exclusion program for those who may need our assistance. Upon your request, we will cancel your membership and will prevent you from entering the Site.
         </li>
         <li>
          We let you set your own maximum allowed deposit amount.
         </li>
         <li>
          Upon your request, we will remove your name from our email list.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Remember!
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
         <li>
          Gaming is a form of entertainment. It is not a way to get rich quickly and pay off your debts.
         </li>
         <li>
          Gaming is a game of chance. There are no formulas that guarantee winnings.
         </li>
         <li>
          Make sure that the decision to play is your choice.
         </li>
         <li>
          Never try to chase your losses.
         </li>
         <li>
          Check the amounts you spend on a regular basis.
         </li>
         <li>
          Make sure you know the rules of the games you play.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Like many things, what is enjoyable in moderation can be disastrous in excess.

         Game Time Reminder and AUTOPLAY Limits (for UK players only)

          Game Time Reminder
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to keep track of the time spent actively playing an instant game, you are provided with the opportunity to activate a game time reminder through the Settings tab. A new game time interval will begin for each instant game that you open, and will operate independently of any other instant game that may be open at the same time. If you change the game timing when you are playing in an instant game, the new timing will only be effective on the following instant game opened.
        </p>
        <p>
         The game time reminder must be set per account with the Site, it will not be automatically applied to any other account which you may have with us.
        </p>
        <p>
         Please note that in order to set or change the game time reminder for the Evolution Live Casino games you will need to do so through the Evolution Live Casino Settings menu.

          AUTOPLAY Limits

        <p>
         AUTOPLAY automatically plays the game for you, for the number of rounds you select. You can select the number of rounds you can play in one batch. The maximum number of rounds which you may select will not be more than 100 on the games where AUTOPLAY is offered. Once you have selected the number of rounds and hit the SPIN button you will be prompted to select your Loss Limit. During AUTOPLAY if you reach your Loss Limit, the AUTOPLAY will automatically stop. You may also set a single Win Limit and if you hit the Win Limit the AUTOPLAY will automatically stop. Regardless of the Loss Limit or Win Limit that you set, AUTOPLAY will automatically stop when you hit the jackpot or the limit on the number of AUTOPLAY rounds you have set is reached.

         Withdrawal Policy Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
         The method by which you withdraw is directly dependent on the payment method by which you have submitted your deposit(s) in the past in accordance with the following terms:
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
         <li>
          The minimum withdrawal amount in Bingo is £5 and subject to minimum limits imposed by available payment methods.
         </li>
         <li>
          If you used one of your credit/debit cards to deposit funds to your account, the relevant withdrawal will be paid back to that particular card;
         </li>
         <li>
          If you used a variety of payment methods to deposit into your account and the requested withdrawals are equal to or less than the deposit(s), then the withdrawals are refunded based on the payment methods used and the amounts deposited for each payment method in the following order:
          <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
           <li>
            Visa cards
           </li>
           <li>
            UK MasterCard
           </li>

           <li>

           </li>
          </ol>
         </li>
         <li>
          If your withdrawal amounts are higher than the deposit(s), then following payment in accordance with Sub-Section (ii) above, the remaining withdrawal balance will be paid to you according to your chosen payment method(s).
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         However, in case you used a Entropay, Paysafecard, a non UK MasterCard or an invalid card which we are unable to send payments to and therefore*, your withdrawal will be returned to you via wire transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
         * Please see Credit/debit cards Exceptions below.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Can I reverse a withdrawal request?
        </h3>
        <p>
         Once your withdrawal request is submitted (by clicking the 'Confirm withdrawal' button in the Bingo cashier) it will be processed in two business days. During this time you may cancel your withdrawal request by clicking the 'Reverse Withdrawal' button in the Cashier and returning the funds to your Bingo account.
        </p>
        <p>
         After two business days, the status of your withdrawal request will change to 'Completed' and you will no longer be able to cancel it.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Will I need to provide certain documents before making a withdrawal?
        </h3>
        <p>
         During the withdrawal process you may be required to provide documents to confirm your identity or ownership of the credit/debit cards used to deposit to your Bingo account thereby ensuring, that withdrawals are paid to the right person.

         One of the main concerns of online gaming operations is to guarantee fair gaming. The Company (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) understands the importance of explaining how this is actually done:
        </p>
        <p>
         With the exception of LIVE games, which are broadcast in real-time with live dealers via webcam, the "dealer" on the website is really a computer. To assure the integrity of our games, a trusted Random Number Generator (RNG) is always used to determine the outcomes of our games. Whether it's the bingo ball selection, a roll of a dice, a hand of cards, or a spin of the wheel, in each event a RNG is utilized to ensure compliance with relevant standards. The system has been rigorously tested by running millions of rounds and examining their results. The system is systematically tested by the Company.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Company offers a variety of games, including some that are developed by third party companies, allowing us to offer our members a wider selection of gaming experiences. Where the games provided are not "in house" games of our own development, a number of additional procedures are undertaken to ensure that they adhere to our own standards. In addition, our game providers utilize their own, separate in house testing processes, including testing of the RNG.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also provide our members with an easy to use online log of their game results via your device where available or via customer support. This information may be reviewed at any time, and includes bingo game results, as well as deposit and withdrawal records.

        <h2>
         I have been asked to provide proof of income, is this genuine?
        </h2>
        <p>
         Yes, this would be a genuine request that we will come from either our Cassava security team or your Account Manager.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Why am I being asked to provide proof?
        </h2>
        <p>
         We understand that this is a sensitive request but it is a clear licencing requirement from the Gambling Commission of Great Britain. CostaBingo is not alone in seeking this type of information from customers, and regardless where you play online, you will also be requested to provide this information from you when your spend/play reaches equivalent levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a betting operator, licenced and regulated to trade in the UK, we have a licencing obligation to know that the source of the funds that customers use to play with us is legitimate. Therefore, at times when certain limits and thresholds are reached it may become necessary for us to ask customers to provide evidence to confirm the source(s) of funds they use to play with us.
        </p>
        <h2>
         What information do I need to provide?
        </h2>
        <p>
         We will need evidence to identify and support the source and value of the funds you use to bet/play with. This could be:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          A recent bank statement/savings account that clearly shows consistent incoming values from an identifiable source.
         </li>
         <li>
          Dated proof of an award/payment made to you;
         </li>
         <li>
          Proof of earnings: Payslip/Director remuneration/Dividends/Pension
         </li>
         <li>
          Any document showing you are employed, with details of your employment.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
         I’ve been playing for years, why am I only being asked for this now?
        </h2>
        <p>
         UK gambling and licencing regulations are constantly evolving in order to better protect consumers; this is a relatively new requirement that effects all (licensed) legal operators in the UK market. Operators are obliged to obtain this information once a player has reached a certain threshold of deposits – in many cases this amount takes years to reach. We understand this can seem intrusive and will always do our best to deal with this issue sensitively and confidentially.
        </p>
        <h2>
         How will the information be used?
        </h2>
        <p>
         We would like to assure you that any information provided will be treated in the strictest confidence in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We have a small, dedicated, secure department who perform the assessments and strictly control the process. The information you provide will not be used by ourselves for any purpose other than to establish that the money you use to play comes from legitimate sources, such that we can discharge our regulatory obligation. We understand that you may find this process intrusive; however, we must adhere to the Gambling Commissions licencing requirements.
        </p>
        <h2>
         What will happen if I do not send in proof of my source of funds?
        </h2>
        <p>
         Unfortunately if you cannot provide us with sufficient information, we will need to limit your deposits with us for three months following the source of funds request. Should information still not be provided after 3 months we would need to suspend your account. We would gladly review this if you are able to provide the requested information at any point in the future.
        </p>
        <h2>
         How do I send my documents to you?
        </h2>
        <p>
