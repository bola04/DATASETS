         , soma is a pleasureable cure-all; but it underwrites a static, philistine, loveless society where intellectual progress of any kind has been abolished. Surely we don't want to end up as brave new worlders?

         The second stereotype of life-long bliss strikes us as even more degrading than pharmacological hedonism. It features an intra-cranially self-stimulating
         <a href="https://www.wireheading.com/wired.html">
          rat
         </a>
         . The little creature's enraptured frenzy of lever-pressing is eventually followed by death from inanition, self-neglect and immunological collapse. Not just rats, but also fish, chickens, rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, monkeys and humans have all been found to exhibit electrical self-stimulatory behaviour when given the opportunity to do so. The pleasure-pain axis is an invariant feature of the vertebrate line - and

       - and of all the pitfalls that "unnatural" pleasure entails.
       <p>
        Rats, of course, have a very poor image in our culture. Our mammalian cousins are still widely perceived as "vermin". Thus the sight of a blissed-out, manically self-stimulating rat does not inspire a sense of vicarious

        </a>

        </i>
        of stimuli an organism finds rewarding. Novelty-seeking is normally heightened. Dopaminergics aren't just euphoriants: they also enhance "incentive-motivation". On this basis, our future is likely to be

        INTRA-CRANIAL SELF-STIMULATION
       </h3>
       The story of the biochemical roots of
       <a href="https://www.paradise-engineering.com/paradise-history.html">
        paradise
       </a>
       is illuminating, but it's not very edifying. In the 1950s,
       <a href="https://www.wireheading.com/james-olds.html">
        James Olds
       </a>
       and his colleagues invented a procedure known as intracranial self-stimulation. By implanting a permanent thin wire-electrode in a rat's brain, the captive rodent was given the ability to
       <a href="https://www.wireheading.com/hypermotivation.html">
        self-administer
       </a>
       a small electric shock. The current used is typically less than 0.0005 amperes. The pulse lasts for less than a second: the rodent wirehead must press the lever again to get another hit. Different placements of the electrode elicit different intensities of response. Rates of up to 10,000 bar-presses an hour may be recorded - but only for pulses delivered to the most rewarding brain-areas. An animal will self-stimulate for a whole day and night without rest, and cross a powerfully electrified grid, to gain access to the lever when its reward-centres are wired up.
       <p>
        Olds mapped the whole brain. Stimulation of some areas - the
        <a href="https://www.wireheading.com/neg-stim/">
         periaqueductal
        </a>
        grey matter, for instance - proved aversive: an animal will work hard to avoid it. "Aversive" is probably a euphemism: electrical pulses to certain neural pathways may be terrifying or excruciating. Euphemisms aside, our victims are being
        <a href="https://www.animal-rights.com/">
         tortured
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Happily, more regions in the brain are rewarding to stimulate than are unpleasant. Yet electrical stimulation of most areas, including the great bulk of the neocortex, is motivationally neutral.
       </p>
       <p>
        One brain region in particular does seem especially enjoyable to stimulate: the medial forebrain bundle. The key neurons in this bundle originate in the ventral tegmental area (
        <a href="https://www.amphetamines.org/vta/">
         VTA
        </a>
        ) of the basal ganglia. VTA neurons manufacture the catecholamine neurotransmitter
        <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/dopapharm.htm">
         dopamine
        </a>
        . Dopamine is transported down the length of the neuron, packaged in synaptic vesicles, and released into the synapse. Crucially, VTA neuronal pathways project to the
        <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/dopamine.htm">
         nucleus accumbens
        </a>
        . VTA dopaminergic neurons are under continuous inhibition by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (
        <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/gaba-ergic.htm">
         GABA
        </a>
        ) system.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent years, a convergence of neuropharmacological evidence,
        <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/mesod2d3.htm">
         clinical research
        </a>

If rats or monkeys have the opportunity to self-administer cocaine without limit, however, they will do virtually nothing else. They continue to push a drug-delivery lever for as long as they are physically capable of doing so. Within weeks, if not days, they will lose a substantial portion of their body weight - up to 40%. Within a month, they will be dead.

        Humans don't have this problem. So what keeps our mesolimbic dopamine and opioidergic systems so indolent? Why does a "hedonic treadmill" stop us escaping from a genetically-predisposed "

       </p>
       <p>
        Evolutionary biology provides some plausible answers. A capacity to experience many different flavours of unhappiness - and short-lived joys too - was adaptive in the ancestral environment. Anger, fear, disgust, sadness, anxiety and other core emotions each played a distinctive information-theoretic role, enhancing the reproductive success of our forebears. Thus at least a partial explanation of endemic human misery today lies in ancient selection pressure and the state of the unreconstructed vertebrate genome. Selfish DNA makes its throwaway survival-machines feel discontented a lot of the time. A restless discontent is typically good for promoting its "inclusive fitness", even if it's bad news for us. Nature simply doesn't care; and

        The mesolimbic dopamine pathway passes from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens and ascends to the frontal cortex where it innervates the higher brain. This architecture is explicable in the light of evolution. Raw limbic emotional highs and lows - in the absence of represented objects, events or properties to be (dis)satisfied about - would be genetically useless to the organism. To help self-replicating DNA differentially leave more copies of itself, the textures of subjective niceness and nastiness must infuse our representations of the world, and - by our lights -

Thus we can eventually get bored of anything - with a single exception. Stimulation of the pleasure-centres of the brain never palls. Fire them in the right way, and boredom is neurochemically impossible. Its substrates are missing. Electrical stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system is more intensely rewarding than eating, drinking, and

       "?
       <p>
        Natural selection has previously been "blind". Complications aside, genetic mutations and meiotic shufflings are quasi-random i.e. random with respect to what is favoured by natural selection. Nature has no capacity for foresight or contingency-planning. During the primordial Darwinian Era of life on Earth,
        <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/object27.htm">
         selfishness
        </a>
        in the technical genetic sense has closely overlapped with selfishness in the popular sense: they are easily confused, and indeed selfishness in the technical sense is unavoidable. But in the new reproductive era - where (suites of) alleles will be
        <i>
         societally
        </i>
        chosen and actively designed by quasi-rational agents in
        <i>
         anticipation
        </i>
        of their likely behavioural effects - the character of fitness-enhancing traits will be radically different.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a start, the elimination of such evolutionary relics as the
        <a href="https://www.supercentenarian.com/archive/antiaging.html">
         ageing
        </a>
        process will make any form of (post-)human reproduction on earth - whether

         momentous
        </a>

        <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/misc/merchimmort.html">
         post-ageing
        </a>

        <i>
         weren't
        </i>
        regulated, then the Earth would soon simply exceed its

         carrying capacity
        </a>
        - whether it is 15 billion people or even 150 billion. If reproduction on earth does cease to be a personal affair and becomes a (democratically accountable?) state-sanctioned choice, then a major shift in the character of typically adaptive behavioural traits will inevitably occur. Taking a crude genes' eye-view, a variant allele coding for, say, enhanced
        <a href="https://www.oxytocin.org/cuddle-hormone/">

         higher
        </i>
        payoff in the technical selfish sense - hugely increasing the likelihood that such alleles and their customised successors will be differentially
        <i>
         pre-

        selected in preference to alleles promoting, say, anti-social behaviour.

        Told like this, of course, the neurochemical story is a simplistic parody. It barely even hints at the complex biological, socio-economic and
        <a href="delgado/index.html">
         political
        </a>
        issues at stake. Just who will take the decisions, and how? What will be the role in shaping post-human value systems, not just of exotic new technologies, but of alien forms of emotion whose metabolic pathways and substrates haven't yet been disclosed to us? What kinds, if any, of inorganic organisms or non-DNA-driven states of consciousness will we want to design and implement? What will be the nature of the
        <i>
         transitional
        </i>
        era - when our genetic mastery of emotional mind-making is still incomplete? How can we be sure that unknown unknowns won't make things go wrong? True, Darwinian life may often be

        <a href="https://www.utilitarianism.com/biotech.html">
         biosphere
        </a>
        could still be morally "wrong" - even if it strikes its inhabitants as self-evidently right?
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, we will only begin to glimpse the implications of Post-Darwinism when paradise-engineering becomes a mature scientific discipline and mainstream research tradition. Yet as the vertebrate genome is rewritten, the two senses of "selfish" will foreseeably diverge. Today they are easily conflated. A tendency to quasi-psychopathic

         callousness

        to other sentient beings did indeed enhance the inclusive fitness of our DNA in the evolutionary past. In the new reproductive era, such traits are potentially maladaptive. They may even disappear as the
        <a href="https://www.reproductive-revolution.com/index.html">

        </a>
        matures.
       </p>
       <p>
        The possibility that we will become not just exceedingly happier, but nicer, may sound
        <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/heaven.htm">
         too good to be true
        </a>
        . Perhaps we'll just become happier
        <i>
         egotists
        </i>
        - in every sense. But if a genetic predisposition to niceness becomes systematically fitness-enhancing, then genetic selfishness - in the technical sense of "selfish" - ensures that benevolence will not just triumph; it will also be evolutionarily stable, in the games-theory sense, against "defectors".
       </p>
       <p>
        Needless to say, subtleties and technical complexities abound here. The very meaning of being "nice" to anyone or anything, for instance, is changed if well-being becomes a generic property of mental life. Either way, once suffering becomes biologically optional, then only sustained and systematic

        From an
        <a href="https://www.utilitarianism.com/">
         ethical
        </a>
        perspective, the task of hastening the Post-Darwinian Transition has a desperate moral urgency - brought home by studying just how

         resist
        </a>
        the demise of unpleasantness may be asked: is it really permissible to
        <i>
         compel
        </i>
        others to suffer when
        <i>
         any
        </i>
        form of distress becomes purely optional? Should the metabolic pathways of our evolutionary past be
        <i>
         forced
        </i>
        on anyone who prefers an odyssey of life-long happiness instead? If so, what means of coercion should be employed, and by whom?
