           Mark had known his life would change after high school, but he had expected the changes to wait until graduation, at least.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then he killed the sheriff's son in self-defense.  Sheriff Creston   wasn't going to believe that his son had turned into a monster with   fangs, fur, and claws, so Mark rushed to escape through the gate into   Elsewhere and hide for a while.  However things turned worse from the   moment he reached the gate, and now it seems as though everything in the   magical realm is out to get him -- and it has nothing to do with what happened back in the human world.

           So welcome to the crazy life of Mark   Ward, his fae-employed cousin Maggie, and Edmond, the talking cat.  They   -- and you -- are in for an adventure or two.

How is she supposed to deal with   someone like him in her own home?

           Welcome to Grey Station 9....
           <br/>
           <br/>
           When Ra wakes up on the cold metal   floor, he fears past deeds have caught up with him. The truth is worse:   his boss, the Head of Security, drugged him and stole his travel chit.    Ra didn't know the ship was the last one scheduled to visit Grey Station   9.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Now he is trapped in a disaster waiting to happen.  The   station itself was never completed.  Many of the crew have left along   with the man who drugged him.  Thousands of colonists  were transported   here on their way to a new world then abandoned.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And now it is up to Ra, as the new Head of Security, to keep things from getting worse.
           <br/>
          </p>
          <p>
           He's not happy.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           No one is happy.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Things are going to get worse.

           The Gods are returning and bringing chaos with them.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The only   hope of survival the desert tribes have lies with the ancient Standard   of the Gods and the mysterious powers it holds.  However, getting the   Standard to the sacred city of Tiamarta isn't going to be an easy   journey, especially for Gareth, a man born in the northern lands of   mountains and snow, and now one of the two men who has taken an oath to   see the Standard to safety.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           With enemies on all sides and chaos   closing in, anything can happen. The future is written in the sand, and a   change of wind can change -- or erase -- everything.

           Circe's sacred forest is a place where wounded and hunted animals can   find sanctuary.  She and her long-time companions -- a one-eyed wolf, a   cat with a limp, and a tailless mouse -- have lived quietly until a   wounded young man wanders into her woods, followed by those who are   hunting him.
          </p>
          <p>
           When the All-Mother lets Circe know that she must help   Tiernan, the best she can do is to send her friends to protect him,   though they cannot go in their animal forms.

           Lord Micalus Raventower is a genius at creating clockwork creatures and tinkering with steampunk engines, but that doesnt explain why Atiran assassins are suddenly intent on killing him. Lt.  Merriweather is assigned to protect Lord Raventower, a role she initially resents since it takes her away from the castle and any chance of advancement to the King's Guard.
          </p>
          <p>
           Trouble is brewing for the city of Kamere.  Atrian warships stand off the coast, and there are enemies even within the ranks of the nobility itself. Merriweather and the eccentric young lord will have quite a job keeping him alive as well as hiding his more unusual secrets.  She soon learns there may be very good reasons for the Atrians to want Lord Raventower dead.

           <p>
            War has come to the city of Kamere.  The Atrian ships are blockading the   coast and occasionally landing troops in attempts to either take the   city or to capture some of Sedina's coastline.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The villages   inland are in chaos, food supplies are already growing scarce, and   several areas of the city are in ruins.  However, the Sedina forces --   Army, Navy, and Air Patrol -- are keeping the mass of Atrians out.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Atrian   assassins are still trying to kill Lord Raventower.  More worrisome   than that, however, is the Atrian's dangerous interest in the object   lying on the ocean floor near Raventower itself.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Giant   clockwork spiders, glowing women -- family dinner gatherings with the   Merriweathers -- Micalus Raventower is not certain even the redoubtable   Captain Merriweather and his clockwork creations can keep him safe from   all the trouble he's attracting.

           Lee went to prison for the murder of a young woman, but five years later the true killer had been found and he was free again.
                 His wife had remarried and taken their son with her.  His parents had gone back to Greece.  With nothing to tie him to the East Coast, Lee heads for the American Southwest on a whim.
          </p>
          <p>
           There he meets Cheveyo Rey, the owner of a piece of land others want to bulldoze for a new high-end elitist community.
                 
                 Lee and Chev are willing to fight to protect the land and the unusual archeology finds discovered there.

           Unfortunately, the Red Sun Corporation is willing to kill for what they want.

           Kostin Helena
           <br/>
           has been assassinated!
          </h2>
          <p>
           The death of such an influential man affects not only the powerful Five Families that control the world of Caine’s Hold, but also creates trouble for the off-world appointed Chief Magistrate, Tartina Altay.  While she works to contain the riots and worse that tear apart the capital city, Baran Helena, Kostin’s unpopular successor, pushes to take command of the entire world, no matter what the cost.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, Kostin had a second son.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kostanos Helena escaped Helena House the night his father died.  Addicted to the drug Soft, and living precariously as a street singer, Kostanos survives because Baran believes his brother has escaped off-world, while Altay is convinced the younger Helena must be dead.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unfortunately, as long as Helena House stays in Baran’s hands, nothing will get better, and it may be that Kostanos is the only hope of survival for Caine’s Hold.
