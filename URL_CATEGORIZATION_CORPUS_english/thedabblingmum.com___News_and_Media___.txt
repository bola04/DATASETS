      Hello, Aloha, Bienvenidos, Buongiorno, Czesc, Jambo, Zdravstvuite, Konichiwa, and Ni hao.
     </h3>
     <p>
      I'm Alyice (uh-lease) Edrich and I am a dabbler at heart. But don't let the idea of dabbling fool you! I am a firm believer in the powers of dabbling as a way to finding our unique purpose in life. I believe that taking the time to try new things, to experience new adventures, and to explore new possibilities allows us the opportunity to not only change our own lives, but impact the lives around us—in a very positive and fulfilling way.
     </p>
     <h3>
      A Little Background
     </h3>
     <p>
      I currently make my home in Sioux Falls, South Dakota where I enjoy writing, making art, and spending time with my loved ones.
     </p>
     <p>
      From 2000 to 2015, I ran a homebased freelance business with an award-winning online magazine for
      <i>
       BUSY
      </i>
      parents while living my dream of being the quintessential housewife/stay-at-home mom.
     </p>
     <p>
      The magazine was a place of refuge for
      <i>
       BUSY
      </i>
      moms who wanted to find their place in the world without losing sight of what really mattered to them—their families. It was also a place where moms could feel comfortable with the choices they made, and the changes they wanted to make, and not feel guilty because they were not living up to someone else's ideals.
     </p>
     <p>
      After 13 years of running the magazine, I closed it and the newsletters down and took a much needed break from the world of business. Though I kept the website online, and picked up a few odd jobs from time to time, I didn't devote much time to running the business. In fact, I spent my days working a part-time job. (
      <i>
       Yeah, I couldn't believe it either!
      </i>
      ) It was refreshing to wake up each morning and not have to worry about where the next paycheck was coming from—and, I was surprisingly happy!
     </p>
     <p>
      By 2015, I realized that I no longer wanted to run a homebased business and longed to work for a company that allowed me the opportunity to utilize all the talents and skills I learned over the years... so I closed the business for good.

     <h2>
      In Search of a Job
     </h2>
     <p>
      Today, I am in search of a company that believes in hiring hard-working people and treating them with respect and integrity because that's when employees do their best work and provide the best customer service.
     </p>
     <h3>
      What I Offer
     </h3>
     <p>
      I give any company I work for the best I have to offer while I'm on the clock. I can adapt to nearly any situation, I have experience managing others as well as managing projects, and I can work independently or with a team.
     </p>
     <p>
      I believe in the power of a positive customer experience. Throughout my career, I’ve come to understand the importance of good customer relationships, of resolving customer complaints quickly, and ensuring customers are well cared for.
     </p>
     <p>
      I also understand how happy customers increase profits through repeat purchases and unhappy customers can hurt profits through word-of-mouth marketing.
     </p>
     <h3>
      My Greatest Strength
     </h3>
     <p>
      Aside from being highly organized and detail oriented, I am a problem solver. Show me a problem that needs to be solved and I will find a solution that works best for all parties involved.
     </p>
     <h3>
      My Greatest Weakness
     </h3>
     <p>
      While I have many skills, most of them aren't necessarily transferable to traditional jobs. This is both a weakness and a challenge that I have to overcome every time I apply for a position I feel I am capable of doing.
     </p>
     <img alt="Happy Employees" src="images/happyemployees.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; float: right; width:250px;"/>
     <p>
      I have learned, however, that although I may not have the exact experience—or on-the-job training—a company is looking for, I can often utilize the skills I do possess to help me quickly learn and grow in my position.
     </p>
     <h3>
      My Ideal Job
     </h3>
     <p>
      For me, the ideal job would be one where I woke up every morning excited to go to work because when I’m excited about my job, I perform at optimal levels—which results in happy customers and happy employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      On a day-to-day basis, my ideal job would offer a nice level of activity, interaction with customers and/or other employees, and if possible, a combination of desk work and physical labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’d like a job that offers some flexibility and variety in my shift as I don’t want to be tied to a desk or the phones all day—without the ability to get up and move around a bit.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’m also looking for a job that makes me feel like I'm making a real contribution to the company. I want to work with a company that offers open communication between management and its employees, believes in educating and advancing from within, has good team spirit, and lifts its employees up.
     </p>

      I have no doubt that your PR work was a major contributing factor to the success of the show. Buyers seemed to be on a mission to get to our booth.
