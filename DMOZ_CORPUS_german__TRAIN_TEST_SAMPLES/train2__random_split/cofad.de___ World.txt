          The Trade Development Programme (TDP) supports both the public and private sector to take advantage of new trading opportunities and to create sustainable economic growth in Myanmar. It is implemented by GIZ on behalf of the EU with a budget of €10 million, plus €500,000 in co-funding from the BMZ. Its goals are to support the reform of trade policies, improve customs procedures, promote exports, and ensure quality standards for food safety and consumer protection - and these are to be attained by strengthening human capacities and institutional, political and technical framework conditions.
         </p>
         <p>
          This support intervention is essentially a short-term expert pool with 1,300 expert days, for the last nine months of the TDP that started in January 2015 and runs until August 2018. Experts mobilised by our consortium will cover the following four components:
         </p>

          <li>
           Trade Reform

          COFAD in consortium with GOPA has been awarded a 3 years project component in Madagascar by GIZ. The project component "pond aquaculture" is part of the country package "Development of Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture in Madagascar" (CP MAD) under the "Global Program Support to Sustainable Fishery and Aquaculture (GV Fish). It is part of the special initiative "One World - No Hunger (SEWOH)" of the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development.
         </p>
         <p>
          Aim of the project is to develop the freshwater aquaculture sector in the highlands of Madagascar. The inception phase will last 6 months starting in December; the milestones and focus areas of the project will be determined in this phase.
         </p>
         <p>
          The CP MAD consists of 3 actions areas divided between the French NGO APDRA, GIZ and private consultancy (COFAD):
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           improving the production of fish from rice-fish culture and employment in the sector,
          </li>
          <li>
           improving the production of fish from pond-aquaculture and employment in the sector,
          </li>
          <li>
           creating the required framework for a successful implementation of sustainable aquaculture practices.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Targets of the CP MAD: "The undersupplied population in the selected regions in the highlands of Madagascar and in the area of Antananarivo has more fish products available and an increased income from sustainable and resource-conserving small and medium scale aquaculture production."

          COFAD was commissioned a study on aquaculture by GIZ in the framework 'Private Sector Development South Caucasus' (PSD SC): 'SME Development and DCFTA' in Georgia'. The first part of this programme aims to assess the trout farming sector in Georgia and design a programme plan for the development and support of this aquaculture.
         </p>
         <p>
          Georgian trout farming is quite an old sector  needing some support in technology, organisation and structuring as much as financial support and veterinary care. The first field mission in Georgia is planned in December 2016 and the first report on results will be delivered to GIZ early in 2017.

          Three years after the start of the aquaculture development project in Karakalpakstan (KKP, Uzbekistan), the contract between COFAD and GIZ is coming to the end.
         </p>
         <p>
          After several international expert missions in Uzbekistan and some training/workshops for fish farmers, COFAD designed some materials for helping the future pond farming development in KKP and other regions of Uzbekistan. Various 'fact sheets' on good aquaculture practises were designed and published for GIZ. Some educational videos on fish breeding were also edited and delivered.

          The Fisheries Area 'Fischereihafen Bremerhaven' is existing since the EFF funding period. However, a new integrated local development strategy needs to be worked out to realise further funding in the EMFF period. COFAD, which has together with AFC Public Services GmbH (consortium leader) already acquired extensive experiences from their study on the fish and food industry in Bremerhaven, was commissioned with the elaboration of the development strategy for the Fisheries Area.
         </p>
         <p>
          At two meetings with the Local Fisheries Action Group (FLAG) and other local stakeholders, the development objectives and the framework of actions were defined; various ideas for projects were collected. The results of the meetings form the basis of the new strategy. Further arrangements regarding the strategy were made in writing with the FLAG and other local stakeholders.

In a consortium with AFC Public Services GmbH and the University of Rostock, COFAD will carry out this study.
         </p>
         <p>
          The study aims to understand better the different aquaculture actors by conducting surveys, a SWOT analysis, value chain evaluations, and sector interviews during the year 2016.

         <p>
          A final report will be drafted and sent to the BLE in early 2017.

          The fisheries areas of Niedersachsen North Sea continue to exist in the funding period, 2014-2020, in the same form as before. As in the previous funding period, COFAD was commissioned to establish the strategy of the territory, which creates the basis for funding under the EMFF Regulation.
         </p>
         <p>
          During two meetings and brainstorming of over 30 actors from different sectors in the region, the development objectives and a framework were discussed, as well as ideas for projects, which formed the basis for the strategy. Some field trips over the region and different fisheries actions were also done.
         </p>
         <p>
          The strategy was presented to the members of the newly elected local fisheries action group and finalised in a report adopted by the fishery committee.

          The majority of fisheries in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, which operate with gill nets and traps fishing for herring, are currently seeking an MSC certification for this fishery. The first step on this path is the pre-assessment, which is carried out by Acoura and accompanied by the German side by the COFAD.
         </p>
         <p>
          COFAD provided assistance in applying for funding and is responsible for communication with the English certifier, translations, research data on fisheries, environmental impact, the collection of fisheries data by the National Fisheries Office Rostock and the ministry of agriculture and nutrition and for obtaining expert opinions on the German side. The information gathered were given to the certifier in the form of text, bullet points and finished evaluations in GIS maps and images available. The first draft report was forwarded for further discussions with representatives of the fishing industry. The final report will be provided by Acoura, as expected in late January / early February.

          In the new programming period (2014-2020), the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) have adopted a stronger result orientation. This implies that the Operational Programmes of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) should be subject to regular monitoring and evaluation in order to improve their quality and demonstrate their achievements.
         </p>
         <p>
          In line with this, the EMFF Regulation includes for the first time a Common Monitoring and Evaluation System (CMES) for the purpose of measuring the performance of the EMFF and its contribution to the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP) and the EU2020 Strategy.
         </p>
         <p>
          To support the implementation of this new requirement, the Commission has set up the Fisheries and Aquaculture Monitoring and Evaluation (FAME) initiative. Its aim is to foster the development of the CMES and to ensure that the required capacity is progressively built across all components of the CMES, so that effective and efficient systems are in place and deliver the information required by the Common Provision Regulation (CPR) and the EMFF Regulation.
         </p>
         <p>
          In this context, DG MARE has commissioned COFAD and GOPA Com. with the establishment of the
          <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/emff/fame/index_en.htm">

          that brings together a network of experts with a wide range of experience relevant to the goals of the EMFF. The core team of the FAME Support Unit is based in Brussels and will provide support at both the EU level and in the Member States, with the assistance of further thematic experts and of geographical experts working in each Member State.

          The programme includes all significant instruments of promotion of the fisheries sector and is financed by European an national funds. Whereas the assistance of the fish processing industry and the fleet played a central role in previous programmes, the current programming period focuses more on measures of common interest and, among these, particularly on those intended to protect and develop aquatic fauna and flora and on pilot operations. New in the present programme is priority axis 4, sustainable development of fisheries areas.
         </p>
         <p>
          The evaluation analysed the progress of the programme as well as the achieved and expected impact so far. Emphasis was put on the estimation of the administrative effort associated with the implementation of the Operational Programme. In conclusion, a series of recommendations were developed for the current and eventually subsequent programme.

          Brown shrimp fishery has a long tradition in the coastal municipality of Neuharlingersiel. It characterises the overall appearance of the village and contributes to the popularity of this place among tourists.
         </p>
         <p>
          Neuharlingersiel belongs to the most important fisheries locations on the German North Sea coast. However, the number of cutters has been constantly decreasing. Therefore, COFAD has been commissioned by the municipality of Neuharlingersiel to carry out a study on the future of the local brown shrimp fishery.
         </p>
         <p>
          The study analyses options to safeguard fisheries in Neuharlingersiel and presents a series of opportunities for action. It is based on intensive discussions with representatives of several local interest groups and economic sectors.

          , the Institute for Tourism and Recreational Research in Northern Europe (N.I.T.) and COFAD examine the importance of fisheries on the tourism sector in the localities of Ditzum and Greetsiel. Several types of surveys are carried out for this purpose, including a personal population representative survey among 2.000 German over 14 years, visitors’ surveys at the ports of Ditzum and Greetsiel and in two reference sites as well as qualitative focus group studies with North Sea coast visitors.
         </p>
         <p>
          This assessment presents for the first time detailed information on the importance of fisheries for the tourism sector and the causal chains behind this. In addition, information e. g. on the guest structure and on value added of tourism in the localities has been generated.
         </p>
         <p>
          The analysis shows that harbours do play an overall important role in the perception of attractiveness on the North Sea coast, with cutter harbours being particularly attractive, especially when they are embedded in an attractive locality setting and when real fishermen can be seen on their boats. It is exactly the fishermen with their cutters who confer the authenticity to the harbours, and this is what tourists are looking for.

           GOPA Consultants

Since 1965, GOPA Consultants has implemented over 3,000 management and training projects for national and international funding agencies as well as private industry in more than 130 countries.

          In addition, there are changes in COFAD's Management: Suitbert Schmüdderich became new Managing Director in November 2008. He took over from Roland Beck, who retired for health reasons. Suitbert, who has been working for COFAD since 1989, was already appointed authorized signatory (“Prokurist”) in 2004 and has thus been fully involved in the overall management of the company. Roland Beck remains shareholder of COFAD and will continue to support the company, his health permitting. This will ensure continuity in the provision of our services and in maintaining our high standard of delivery.

         <ul>
          <li>
           to optimise the allocation of budgetary resources and to improve programming quality through independent judgment and recommendations.
          </li>
          <li>
           to shed light on choices assessing the feasibility, the effectiveness of different objectives and their coherence with the overall strategy and shall take into account the relevance of objectives compared to needs and inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
           to check if lessons learnt from past experiences have been taken into account and will assess the quality of the diagnostic, the expected impacts and the implementation system.
          </li>
          <li>
           to appraise the community added-value and the extent to which the Community’s priorities have been taken into account.
          </li>
          <li>
           to establish the basis for effective monitoring, ongoing, mid-term and ex post evaluations by ensuring that there are explicit, quantified objectives and appropriate indicators reflecting the strategic and operational objectives of the programme.
          </li>
         </ul>

           Dear visitor of the COFAD website,
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
          After a longer (much too long) period of silence, we have published again a series of news on our web page (see middle column). The delay is due to our intensive dedication to a number of interesting projects in the last months. You will find a brief description of some of them on our site.
         </p>
         <p>
          Besides, there have been some internal developments in our company, among others the integration into the GOPA Consulting Group, our new management and the moving of office from Tutzing to Weilheim. By doing so, COFAD has set the course for assuring the future viability of the company.
         </p>
         <p>
          More news coming soon on our web page, that we firmly intend to update more regularly in future.
         </p>

          <em>
