      This is the virtual home of the Finke Family.
 We are Claudia, Christian and Nicole, happily married since 1993, a family since 1995.
 We live in Germany, in Northrhine-Westphalia since summer 2008. We both were born in Berlin, grew up there and in 1997 we moved to a small community just outside the cityline. Hubby's job has been transferred from Berlin to the Wuppertal location, after our company was taken over by another company, the one with the pills against pains, starting with A and ending with spirin :).

      We love to travel and enjoy exploring new places. You can read about our journeys on my
      <a href="./trips.html">
       traveling page
      </a>
      , and you can see pictures on my
      <a href="http://pix.finke-family.de" target="_blank">
       picture page
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      I've decided to slim down this website and put it back to its original purpose, sharing pictures and travel reports. The personal stuff has to go.
     </p>
     <p>
      Take a cup of coffee or tea, make yourself comfortable, come on in and be part of us for a while.
      <br/>
      We hope you will enjoy your stay and if you have, come back!
