             LPC is a very old bytecode language, invented around 1990, specifically
 to implement multi user virtual environments on the internet. It is not
 the first of its kind, there have been MUDs and MOOs around before, but
 it was the first that used the stack machine principle, these days also
 known as byte code.

            <p class="text">
             LPC can still be a very efficient choice for network server applications.
 Another very special feature about LPC is it's natural integration of object
 orientation without clumsy class syntax. Since every class is by definition
 in its own file, calling methods feels like "calling a function in an other
 file," thus tremendously intuitive.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
             In the mid 90s there was a reimplementation of LPC which now goes by the
 name of
             <a href="http://www.gotpike.org">
              pike
             </a>
             . This language has been quite
 successful with the web servers roxen and
             <!-- its current follow-up -->

              caudium
             </a>
             , but at the same time developed
 even into the user desktop with Gtk support. So today, if you have no
 specific reason to work with LPC, give

 The LPC driver isn't very big and doesn't come with a huge library, so
 it's not like you're installing another large language to your system.
 It comes with bindings for a couple of important C libraries, and that's it.
 You can use
             <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclpce/">
              Eclipse for LPC
