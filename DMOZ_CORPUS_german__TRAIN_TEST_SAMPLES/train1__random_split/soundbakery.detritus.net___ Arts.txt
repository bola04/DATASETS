 i just listened to the sound bakery. it was really fun! I like your
 vision, your work. I like the samples of whistling the best. All those
 people whistling, wowo. 
 
 It got me thinking, it really is like a bakery. It's like beig
 inside an oven with all the sounds bouncing, baking around. I kind of
 thought about you, about how hearin all the sounds around and registering
 them al, it reminded me of how it's about noticing everything, passing
 through, and that's what the bakery is like, all the changing and the
 spaciousness.
