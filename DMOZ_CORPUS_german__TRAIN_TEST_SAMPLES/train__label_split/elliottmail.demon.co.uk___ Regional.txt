          round the headland is a gem. It is very sheltered, completely undeveloped and shelves away gently. It has just one taverna and nothing else (no neon signs, jetskis, disco music, shops or nearby villas or houses). Pissouri Beach, an energetic walk away, has an E.E.C. blue flag award for its vast sweep of a bay. It is a little more commercialised with a half dozen tavernas, a hotel and a good range of water sports facilities for hire including a windsurfing school.

          Pissouri Village is midway between Paphos and Limassol and an easy 20 minutes or so by car from both. Paphos airport is less than 20 minutes and Larnaca about 80 minutes.

           Car hire
          </b>
          for some part of your stay is
          <b>
           strongly recommended
          </b>
          but you can get by on foot with an occasional taxi if you prefer. (The village centre is pedestrianised and more accessible on foot but the hill to the beach is very long and  steep.) A Ford Focus size car will cost you, high season, Ł18.40 per day all inclusive and includes a
          <b>
           chauffeur drive
          </b>
          from Paphos airport to your villa at no extra charge. (A single charge of Ł10 each way covers journeys to and from Larnaca).
