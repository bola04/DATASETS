       Chandimal to miss Barbados Test as Judicial Commissioner rejects appeal

       Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal will miss the day/night Barbados Test, which commences on Saturday 23 June.

         <em>
          Mr Beloff QC to hold hearing on 10 July to determine the appropriate sanction in respect of the admitted Level 3 charges

         <em>
          Hathurusinghe and Gurusinha available to coach and manage Sri Lanka cricket team respectively for Barbados Test starting on Saturday
         </em>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Judicial Commissioner, The Hon Michael Beloff QC, has dismissed Dinesh Chandimal’s appeal after the Sri Lanka captain was found guilty of changing the condition of the ball in breach of clause 41.3 of the ICC’s Standard Test Match Playing Conditions during the second day’s play in the second cricket Test against the Windies in St Lucia on Saturday.  Mr Beloff’s written reasoned decision will be provided on Wednesday 27 June.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, the original decision of the ICC Match Referee Mr Javagal Srinath, handing Chandimal the maximum punishment available under the code, i.e. two suspension points and a fine of 100 per cent of his match fee, will stand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chandimal will therefore miss the day/night Barbados Test, which commences on Saturday. Furthermore, and because two suspension points correspond to four demerit points, these will remain on Chandimal’s disciplinary record.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Beloff QC, who is also the Chairman of the ICC Code of Conduct Commission, heard the appeal on Friday in a four-hour hearing in which both parties were represented by legal counsel.
       </p>
       <p>
        In announcing his decision, Mr Beloff QC said: “I express my gratitude to all who, though located in four different places, London, Colombo. Dubai and Barbados, collaborated in enabling me to reach a decision in time for the third test between the West Indies and Sri Lanka.''
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, Mr Beloff QC also held a preliminary hearing to establish the procedural schedule on the Level 3 charges after Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha admitted to breaching Article 2.3.1, which relates to “
        <em>
         conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game
        </em>
        ”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The preliminary hearing determined that the hearing will take place on 10 July by way of video/telephone conference, with the decision on sanction to follow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Until the hearing takes place and Mr Beloff QC determines the appropriate sanctions for the Level 3 breaches, Mr Hathurusinghe and Mr Gurusinha can continue to perform their professional responsibilities, including in the Barbados Test.
       </p>
       <p>
        All Level 3 breaches carry an imposition of between four and eight suspension points.
       </p>
       <p>
        The three were charged by the ICC Chief Executive David Richardson on Tuesday for their involvement in the Sri Lanka cricket team’s refusal to take to the field in St Lucia at the start of Saturday’s play, which caused a two-hour delay in the start of play.
       </p>
       <p>
        This action was alleged to amount to a serious breach of the Laws of Cricket and to be contrary to the spirit of the game.

       Costly Mistakes: The Great Escape and Wasted Time

      <p>
       The West Indies and Sri Lanka played to a draw in the second Test of what is turning out to be a series for the record books. It was a match of five days, two tales, and countless twists. The hosts were in complete control for the first 120 overs; finding themselves at 118-2 at stumps on day 2, replying to Sri Lanka’s 253 all out. But, the complexion of the match changed on the third day, when the Sri Lankans refused to take the field after they were informed of the umpires’ decision to change the ball; delaying the start of play by two hours. Although the ball was changed, the Asians were presented with an advantage that was nonexistent at the end of day 2 – making the West Indian batsmen wait – returning to the field of play seemingly psyched up. Though the mind-games may not have been intentional, they were without a doubt effective. The West Indies were only able to add 182 for the remaining 8 wickets as Sri Lanka went from taking two wickets in 44 overs to eight within the next 56. The visitors then dominated the remainder of the game, only meeting fierce resistance in the form of Kraigg Brathwaite, who returned to his usual assiduous self. He had help from Shai Hope who showed fight Caribbean fans had not witnessed for some time, staying at the wicket with his fellow Bajan for a total of 36 overs, even while carrying a stomach injury from being hit in the with the ball by Lahiru Kumara.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially, one could have been forgiven for seeing the first innings' scorecard and thinking it was a comprehensive bowling performance from the hosts. After all, Shannon Gabriel and Kemar Roach did restrict the opposition (who won the toss) on Day 1; with figures of 5/59 and 4/49, respectively. Nevertheless, Windies bowlers were found wanting, both in line and length. For much of the 79 overs, the hosts were found guilty of perusing too short a length on a wicket which was rewarding a good length and a line which forces a batsmen to play.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be said that the Caribbean seamers were good in the 1st innings, but they were nowhere near their best. Therefore, merely being ‘good’ meant they had to be near perfect in the field. Case in point, there was a dropped catch and seven extras, which included two no-balls. Being deceived, they returned to the second innings and continued to bowl short of a good length, almost surrendering the Test because of same. Although, this time around they conceded thirty-four extras including eleven no-balls of which three were wicket-taking deliveries. Two of these wicket-taking no-balls were during the match-changing partnership of 117 between Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis. Thus, there is work to be done by the hosts and going into the final Test on June 23, one would hope that the West Indies will make sufficient changes to see out this series and go on to make permanent adjustments for Bangladesh’s visit to the Caribbean next month.

       Hope takes lions share of prizes
      </h2>
      <p class="date">

      <p>
       Batsman Shai Hope took away the lion’s share of prizes at the Cricket West Indies (CWI) and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) held their awards ceremony on Wednesday night in Barbados.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope collected three top awards in front of many former legendary Barbados cricketers, who were invited to the gala affair. The right-hander was voted Test Cricketer of the Year, ODI Cricketer of the Year and the prestigious Cricketer of the Year award, which drew loud applause from those gathered for the function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope’s drive to the Test award was as a result of a great performance over the 12-month period considered. He scored back to back centuries at Headlingly Leeds to take the Windies to a very popular victory over England last September. His 147 in the first essay and 118 not out in the second gave his team an unlikely win. In all he scored 727 runs in the nine Tests he played over the period.
      </p>
      <p>
       His form in the Test arena spilt over to the ODIs and he was very consistent over the last year, scoring his maiden ODI century in Zimbabwe.
       <a href="http://www.guardian.co.tt/sports/2018-06-21/hope-takes-lion%E2%80%99s-share-prizes">
        The only award that he did not pick up was that of T20 player of the Year and that went to the explosive Trinidadian batsman Evin Lewis
       </a>
       . The left-hander scored 234 runs in three T20s for the Windies at an average of 117.0.

       ICC Release: Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha have admitted to breaching Article 2.3.1, a Level 3 offence, which relates to “conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game”.
       <br/>
       Following their admission, the ICC, in accordance with Article 5.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct, has appointed The Hon Michael Beloff QC as the Judicial Commissioner to hear the case to determine the appropriate sanction.
       <br/>
       Mr Beloff has been appointed as the Judicial Commissioner to hear Mr Chandimal’s appeal against the match referee’s decision for changing the condition of the ball and, as per Article 5.2.3, will use Friday’s hearing in that appeal to hold a preliminary hearing to establish the procedural schedule on the Level 3 charges.
       <br/>
       The three were charged by the ICC Chief Executive David Richardson on Tuesday for their involvement in the Sri Lankan cricket team’s refusal to take to the field in St Lucia at the start of Saturday’s play, which caused a two-hour delay in the start of play.
       <br/>
       This action was alleged to amount to a serious breach of the Laws of Cricket and to be contrary to the spirit of the game.
       <br/>
       All Level 3 breaches carry an imposition of between four and eight suspension points.
