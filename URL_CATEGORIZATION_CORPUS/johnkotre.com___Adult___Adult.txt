          "There  is nothing new under the sun," was Ecclesiastes' lament.  But the poet Wislawa Szymborska, a Nobel  laureate, would have none of it.  “You  yourself were born new under the sun,” she tells Ecclesiastes . . .
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <p align="left" class="smaller">
           And the poem you  created is also new under the sun, since no one wrote it down before you.  And all your readers are also new under the  sun, since those who lived before you couldn't read your poem.  And that cypress you're sitting under hasn't  been growing since the dawn of time. . . .
          </p>
          <p align="left" class="smaller">
           And, Ecclesiastes,  I'd also like to ask you what new thing under the sun you're planning to work  on now?  A further supplement to the  thoughts you've already expressed?  Or  maybe you're tempted to contradict some of them now.  Have you taken notes yet, do you have  drafts?  I doubt you'll say, "I've  written everything down, I've got nothing left to add."

          is an extended parable based on the Ten Oxherding Pictures of Zen  Buddhism.  I tell the story as a  Westerner who answered an invitation to simply
          <em>
           look
          </em>
          at the pictures.  The  story that resulted is one in which Spirit does not come down from above but  rises up from below.  It’s about the  creativity in each of us, which reflects the creativity of a universe which waited  some 13.7 billion years to generate ideas.   There was a secret in that original singularity.

          is a tale of creation and evolution—a “philosophical parable,” if you will.  It’s about quarks and bugs and spirits and  stars, not to mention science, religion, and philosophy.  So it’s longer than most parables.  But it’s not that complicated.  There's a Speaker.  There's a Story.  Each has a life.  Each makes a journey.   “You  come from the breath of God,” a boy is told at the beginning of his life.  “You come from stardust,” he says at the  end.  But his is not the last word.

          I described  autobiographical memory as both a keeper of archives and a maker of myth, one  laboring by day, the other by night.   Together, they fashion a life narrative that reveals a self, even  creates a self.
         </p>
         <p>
          In recent visits to the Universities of Arizona and Sao Paulo I tried to illustrate how we put  memory to another use: creating ancestors.   The story of the white gloves is a perfect example: here memory creates  a grandfather with a soul for art, a soul he sacrifices for his family.  In the seven-minute audio clip “
          <a href="season_shorts/20_A_Family_Remembers.mp3" target="_blank">
           A Family Remembers
          </a>
          ,” a family’s four generations make  a hero of their deceased great-grandfather, an epic of his escape from massacre.   “This guy survived that great attack,” a  descendant says.  “I’m going to  survive.”  In the storytelling you can  hear the mythmaker at work, creating ancestral help.

          There  comes a point when listening to a life story when you ask yourself, how much of  this is true?  Truth is not a simple  notion, as I suggested in a
          <a href="the_story_is_it_true_does_it_help.pdf" target="_blank">
           recent talk
          </a>
          .  Historical truth is not  narrative truth, the keeper of archives not the maker of myth.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each kind of truth  has its own methods of verification.  The  critical moment for narrative truth comes when the story you’ve fashioned is  shown to its teller.
