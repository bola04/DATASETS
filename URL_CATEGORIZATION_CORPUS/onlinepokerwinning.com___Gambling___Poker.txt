        Online Poker Winning
       </h1>
       <p>
        Poker is perhaps the most 
recognized card game around. Its popularity cuts across cultures and national 
borders and it is played by millions of people around the world. Nobody can pinpoint 
the exact origins of this game, with some theories claiming that it sprang from 
the Persian game of as nas, while others believing that it shares its roots with 
similar games played in Europe such as primero and the French brelan. By the beginning 
of the nineteenth century, poker was being played in the United States, becoming 
a classic symbol of the westward bound pioneers and their cultural ethos.
       </p>
       <p>
        Poker 
quickly worked its way into the American landscape and was played for decades 
in gambling halls, casinos and informally in private circles. By the 1970's, the 
game took off to even great heights with the introduction of strategy books and
        <a href="http://www.onlinepokerwinning.com/Poker_Tournament_Strategy.php">
         poker 
tournaments
        </a>
        , with many players dreaming of winning poker competitions and 
striking it rich.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the single most important benchmark in the entire 
history of poker was certainly the introduction of internet gambling. With the 
technology in place, in no time at all, the game of poker made a seamless transition 
to the world of the Internet.
        <a href="http://www.onlinepokerwinning.com/Online_Poker.php">
         Online

        </a>
        became an overnight success and opened the doors of this exciting game 
to literally millions of players around the globe. Software companies tried to 
create the same realistic and fast paced action found around
        <a href="http://www.onlinepokerwinning.com/setup_game.php">
         poker 
tables
        </a>
        and players flocked to sites that offered the best games and tournaments 
around, in a bid to win at poker.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the years that followed, the worlds 
of
        <a href="/">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://www.onlinepokerwinning.com/home_poker.php">
         traditional 
poker
        </a>
        meshed even further, as
        <a href="http://www.onlinepokerwinning.com/Online_Poker.php">
         Internet 
poker rooms
        </a>
        regularly fed top land-based poker tournaments, such as the annual 
World Series of Poker event, with some of the best players in the industry. Players 
such as Chris Moneymaker, the 2003 WSOP Main Event champion who shot his way to 
a $2,500,000 victory by investing only $40 in a PokerStars online poker room competition, 
grabbed the attention of amateurs who rushed to try their luck at online poker 
tournaments themselves.

        The success of
        <a href="http://www.onlinepokerwinning.com/Online_Poker.php">
         online

        </a>
        however, grabbed the attention of authorities as well, who feared that 
the very nature of the internet did not allow sufficient regulation and only encouraged
        <a href="problematic_gambling.php">
         problematic gambling habits
        </a>
        . As a result, 
many countries around the world, with the United States spearheading the campaign, 
began moves to clamp down or even ban online gambling, with poker online being 
included in the deal. In 2006, the United States passed its controversial Unlawful 
Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which essentially barred financial institutions 
from transferring money to or from US-based players. This law has been challenged 
on several fronts, both on home ground and in the international arena. Organizations 
such as the Poker Player's Alliance have been taking steps to get poker recognized 
as a skills game, therefore removing the need to classify it as a gambling pastime 
and including it in the UIGEA.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, the United Kingdom has 
recently adopted a more lenient approach to
        <a href="Online_Poker.php">
         online 
poker
        </a>
        and casino gambling by making it a legal form of entertainment, subject 
to strict regulations. As a result of these dynamic changes in the industry, the 
focus of the poker industry has shifted slightly more towards the United Kingdom 
and Europe, although it still remains a strong game in the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        While 
poker suffered a minor setback in the US due to new legislation governing the 
game, it continues to attract large communities of online players from around 
the world.
