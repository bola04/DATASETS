      Ebooks are digitised versions of paper books. That is to say,
they are computer files. The ebooks available from Project
Gutenberg Australia, all of which are free of charge, are usually
provided in 'txt' or 'html' format and can be read on any personal
computer or laptop, using a text editor such as
      <i>
       Notepad
      </i>
      ,
which comes bundled with every copy of Microsoft
      <i>
       Windows,
      </i>
      or
with a web browser such as
      <i>
       Internet Explorer
      </i>
      or
      <i>
       Firefox
      </i>
      . However, when this basic method is used to read
ebooks one is not able to bookmark pages for future reference or
jump to a particular chapter from the Table of Contents.

      These shortcomings, have been overcome by the development of
software specifically designed to read ebooks on personal computers
and laptops. Good examples are
      <i>
       Tom's eTextReader
      </i>
      from
Fellnersoft and
      <i>
       yBook
      </i>
      and
      <i>
       yRead
      </i>
      from Spacejock
Software. This software boasts many features to make the experience
of reading ebooks more rewarding. The
      <i>
       yRead
      </i>
      software will
even read the book back to you, using a synthesised voice. You want
more, I hear you say. Well, both offerings are free of charge and
can be downloaded directly from the internet.
      <i>
       Microsoft
Reader
      </i>
      software, for both PC an PocketPC is also very popular.
The meaning of words can be looked up in a dictionary, and
bookmarks can be added. Check out the Microsoft Reader site. Go to
the Download page for free downloads. There is more information on

      Of course, books are not usually read while one is sitting in
front of a computer. We want to be able to carry them with us and
read them while sitting on a train, or while resting in an easy
chair or at the beach. This need for mobility precipitated the
development of proprietary ebook reading devices (ereaders). Such
devices have been around for quite a few years now, with varying
degrees of success. Recently we have seen the release of several
new offerings, including the
      <i>
       Sony Reader
      </i>
      and the
      <i>
       Amazon
Kindle
      </i>
      . The
      <i>
       iRex iLiad, iRex DR1000S, HanLin
      </i>
      and
      <i>
       Cybook
      </i>
      are ebook readers which are also available in
Australia, at the time of writing this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      The software available for use with these devices often allows
for ebook files to be converted into a format which makes the
ebooks easier to read on a particular device. The '
      <i>
       epub
      </i>
      '
format, a free and open standard set by the International Digital
Publishing Forum (IDPF), may, in time, become a universal standard
for ebook publishing so that ebooks published in epub format can be
read on any ereader.
     </p>

      Many people use a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a tablet
or mobile phone, such as the
      <i>
       iPhone
      </i>
      , to read ebooks. One
usually needs to convert the basic text file or html file, which
comprises the ebook, into a file format more suitable for display
on the device's screen.
      <i>
       Calibre
      </i>
      software was specifically
developed for just this purpose and may be downloaded from the
      <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">
       Calibre web site
      </a>
      , free of
charge.
     </p>
     <p>
      The HTML format is used universally on web sites to display
content. Many of the ebooks available from Project Gutenberg
Australia are provided in html format. By using this format, it is
possible to display images in the ebooks and to provide a Table of
Contents from which users can jump to the start of any chapter in
the ebook. The use of coloured text and different printer fonts can
also be used to enhance the appearance, readability and utility of
the ebook. Some of the software and devices mentioned above support
html files, however images which are displayed in the html files
often cannot be seen on those devices. There is more information on
this subject on our
