Choosing the right one will depend on your circumstances, spending and saving habits, as well as your saving goals. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about ING savings accounts.</p>\n<h3>Who is ING?</h3>\n<p>ING has been trading in Australia since 1999, making them a relatively new player in the banking scene. However, their parent company, ING Group, has a much longer history, originating in the Netherlands and tracing back as far as 1845.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, ING offers Australian consumers one alternative to the big four banks. They have only one branch, located in Sydney and advertised as the &ldquo;ING Lounge&rdquo;. The majority of their customers&rsquo; banking is done online, with the use of both online banking and the ING mobile app.</p>\n<h3>What is a savings account?</h3>\n<p>A savings account is an additional bank account that many consumers hold, in addition to their everyday transaction accounts.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is that a savings account is a separate account to store and accrue money that you wish to save. We all know that if we leave our savings in our transaction account, they often don&rsquo;t stay savings for long.</p>\n<p>Having a savings account makes it easier to keep track of your savings, and harder to &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; dip in when money gets tight. Many savings account also deliberately come without ATM access, making it even harder to spend your savings (although certainly not impossible.)</p>\n<h3>What should I look for in a savings account?</h3>\n<p>The goal of your savings account is &ndash; unsurprisingly &ndash; to help you maximise the money you save, while minimising your chances of spending your savings.</p>\n<p>The main thing to look for in a savings account is a high interest rate. You want the money that you are saving to accrue as much interest as possible, in order to grow your savings. Many banks offer savings account with introductory or &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; interest rates for the first three months or so. These may seem enticing, but remember to check the base interest rate too, as this is what you&rsquo;re signing up for in the long term.</p>\n<p>You should also check for any additional fees. These might include account-keeping, transaction or even deposit fees. Make sure that you&rsquo;re not signing up for an account that will drain your savings in fees.</p>\n<h3>What can I expect from an ING savings account?</h3>\n<p>ING has won multiple awards for their savings accounts, which is a promising start. Because ING banking is done predominantly online, overall operations costs are lower than a traditional &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; bank. These savings can then be passed onto consumers, with lower account-keeping fees and higher interest rates.</p>\n<p>ING offers a range of savings options, including traditional savings accounts and term deposits. Start by comparing savings options and their interest rates, and make sure to take into account both the standard and variable interest rates.</p>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the difference between standard and variable interest rates?</h3>\n<p>The variable interest rate is another name for a honeymoon or bonus interest rate. As previously mentioned, this higher interest rate could be applied to your savings account for the first few months. This is common practice among many banks, to entice new customers to switch banks.</p>\n<p>A variable interest rate could also be applied to your savings account as an incentive for certain activities. For example, your bank might apply the variable interest rate if you deposit a certain amount of money each month, and make no withdrawals. These activities encourage more savings for you, and also mean that the bank is handling more of your money, so they are happy to incentivise them.</p>\n<p>The standard interest rate is, to put it simply, the interest rate on your savings account when the variable rate no longer applies. This could be because you&rsquo;ve reached the end of the honeymoon period, or you haven&rsquo;t met the required activity to be rewarded with the variable interest rate. Make sure to take the standard interest rate into account when considering a savings account, as it is usually significantly lower than the variable interest rate.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to remember that interest rates - both standard and variable - are at the bank&rsquo;s discretion and can change at any time.</p>\n<h3>Is an ING savings account right for me?</h3>\n<p>Whether a particular bank or account is the right option for you will always depend on your personal circumstances, income and spending and saving habits.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re considering an ING savings account, be sure to compare this account with other competitors too, to make sure you&rsquo;re getting the right account for you.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to bank online, ING could be a good option for you. But make sure to consider all of your options before making a decision.</p>","hasContent":true,"hasRepaymentWidget":false,"logo":"//production-ultimate-assets.ratecity.com.au/ratecity/image/upload/v1502328878/company/nz4eowupbneh7xupca6x.png","metadata":{"google":{},"og":{},"textContent":"<p>ING offers two standard savings accounts – Savings Maximiser and Savings Accelerator.

Here&rsquo;s a helpful guide on savings accounts in Australia.</p>\n<h3>What is a savings account?</h3>\n<p>A savings account helps you grow your savings by offering a compound interest rate that is higher than the rate on your everyday transaction account.</p>\n<p>Designed to accrue money, a savings account usually does not come with a key card for ATM access. To withdraw money, you need to transfer it across to a linked transaction account.</p>\n<p>There are some pros and cons to weigh up before deciding whether a savings account is right for you.</p>\n<p><strong>The pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High interest rates &ndash; </strong>Savings accounts generally come with competitive interest rates that help you reach your financial goals faster, especially given it&rsquo;s a compound interest rate on offer. Many lenders also offer bonus rates for an introductory period, or if certain conditions are met.</li>\n<li><strong>Investment protection &ndash; </strong>Unlike other investments, which come with some risk, a savings account is unlikely to give you a negative return. The government also protects deposits of up to $250,000 in authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs). This means that if your lender is an ADI and it goes bankrupt, your money is safe.</li>\n<li><strong>No lock-in period &ndash; </strong>Savings accounts in Australia typically don&rsquo;t have a lock-in period, so you can move your money at any point. Some people use this feature to opt in and out of different products &ndash; taking advantage of bonus introductory rates on the market, then switching products once the introductory period is over.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fluctuating interest rates &ndash; </strong>Savings account interest rates are variable, which means they fluctuate &ndash; and potentially decrease &ndash; depending on the <a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/rba-cash-rate\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rc-keyword\">cash rate</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Conditions around bonus interest rates &ndash; </strong>Although bonus interest rates are appealing, they often come with conditions such as a limited number of withdrawals, a minimum monthly deposit, or getting a linked transaction account with the same lender. Similarly, bonus introductory rates only last for a certain period before the account reverts to a lower base rate. Take the time to check what conditions are attached to any bonus rate on offer.</li>\n<li><strong>Temptation to spend</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> Most savings accounts allow you to transfer your funds into your transaction account for easy access. While some prefer this flexibility, others may find it a temptation to spend impulsively, rather than save.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there alternatives to a savings account?</h3>\n<p>One alternative to a savings account, which can also come with competitive interest rates, is a term deposit account.</p>\n<p>A term deposit invests your money for a certain period &ndash; usually between one month to five years &ndash; at a fixed rate of interest. It suits savers who want to lock away their money for a period, although the downside is if you want to access your money before the term is over, you may need to pay a penalty.</p>\n<p>In many cases, banks and credit unions require a minimum amount to invest your money in a term deposit account.</p>\n<h3>What should you look for when choosing a savings account?</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s always worth comparing different savings accounts on the market and what they offer. Key questions to ask include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is the interest rate offered the most competitive on the market?</strong> You can use the <span><a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/compare\">RateCity website</a></span> to compare different rates on the market.</li>\n<li><strong>What is the base rate?</strong> An advertised introductory rate only lasts for a certain period. Check the base rate to find out how much interest you will earn once the introductory period is over. This also applies to bonus rates that come with special conditions, as the base rate is what you will earn if those conditions aren&rsquo;t met.</li>\n<li><strong>How accessible is the account?</strong> It&rsquo;s worth finding out if the lender allows you to manage your savings account online, if there is a cheque facility, or if you need to open a transaction account with the same lender to access your money.</li>\n<li><strong>What fees do they charge?</strong> Take the time to check what fees come attached to any product you are considering. You can find them on the product&rsquo;s terms and conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Savings accounts at Bankwest</h3>\n<p><a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/bankwest\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rc-keyword\">Bankwest</a> offers a range of savings accounts with different features that can help you reach your financial goals.</p>\n<p>For more information, you can visit the <span><a href=\"https://www.bankwest.com.au/\">Bankwest website</a></span> and follow the online prompts.

Most of us already have a savings account in some form, but may not be using it to its fullest potential. </span></p>\n<p><span>Depositing money into a savings account for future access might seem like a no-brainer, however there&rsquo;s now more to the art of saving money due to the huge choice of savings accounts available. </span></p>\n<p><span>The type of savings account you choose is dependent on your savings goals and how you spend your money. No two savings accounts are created equal.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, if you wanted to split your income between an amount for saving and a budget for spending, you could do this by using different savings accounts. </span></p>\n<h3>Savings accounts v transaction accounts</h3>\n<p><span>Regular transaction accounts are good for spending. A transaction account (because you&rsquo;re likely to use it frequently) generally has no or low monthly account-keeping fees.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many transaction accounts offer you the choice of a debit card, along with a regular bank card and free use of specific ATMs throughout Australia. </span></p>\n<p><span>These extra benefits are designed so that you can access your money regularly and at little or no cost. The downside is they generally don&rsquo;t pay a good rate of interest on your savings principal.</span></p>\n<p><span>That&rsquo;s OK because there are savings accounts available that are designed for saving not spending. These differ in the fees and charges associated with the type of account. </span></p>\n<p><span>Savings accounts that are specifically for parking money may have small disincentives so you&rsquo;re less likely to withdraw your money. </span></p>\n<p><span>A common type of non-spending savings account is a term deposit. Other interest-bearing savings accounts include reward savers, esvaers, isavers and netbank accounts.</span></p>\n<p><span>These accounts pay a variable base rate of interest and often a bonus rate too. The rate of interest, minimum opening and ongoing deposits depends on what type of savings account you opt for.</span></p>\n<h3>How do I choose a NAB savings account?</h3>\n<p><span><a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/nab\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rc-keyword\">NAB</a> understands the nuances of saving money and offers a diversity of savings accounts to cater for a range of needs.</span></p>\n<p><span>NAB has select savings accounts that are designed for the saver and spender within us all. These accounts acknowledge that you want to earn interest on savings but may need spending money too. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you want to access your savings whenever you want, without affecting your interest rate, there&rsquo;s a savings account option for you. </span></p>\n<p><span>This savings account returns slightly less interest than its counterpart that gives you bonus interest every month that you don&rsquo;t make withdrawals.</span></p>\n<p><span>Both accounts, however, charge no monthly account-keeping or transaction fees and let you withdraw and transfer money whenever you want. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re serious about stashing cash and maximising your interest-earning potential, there&rsquo;s a range of savings accounts to choose from. </span></p>\n<p><span>These accounts cater to the needs of self-managed superannuation fund account-holders and larger cash investments. </span></p>\n<p><span>Compared to the save/spend accounts mentioned, these accounts do have minimum deposit requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span>The great thing about these accounts is they offer higher rates of interest and no account-keeping or transaction fees.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, there&rsquo;s a regular transaction account if you wanted to split your spending off from your savings profile. </span></p>\n<p><span>The beauty of the transaction account is that you won&rsquo;t be charged overdrawn fees if you happen to go over your account balance.</span></p>\n<h3>What are the benefits of a NAB savings account?</h3>\n<p><span>NAB has devised savings accounts that are flexible by providing options that pay interest on your principal while letting you make regular withdrawals anywhere, anytime at no cost. </span></p>\n<p><span>NAB also provides the next level of savings account, offering higher rates of interest on larger sums of money if you&rsquo;re not wanting to touch your savings pile. </span></p>\n<p><span>Or you can have the best of both worlds and connect a regular transaction account to a savings account type and move money between them at no cost. </span></p>\n<h3>How do I apply for a savings account?</h3>\n<p><span>The good news is that you don&rsquo;t have to be an existing NAB customer to apply for a savings account. You can apply online (or in a branch) for any of the NAB savings accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span>Before you get started with an online application though you&rsquo;ll need the following information on-hand to streamline the process:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Passport, driver&rsquo;s licence or Medicare card for identification </span></li>\n<li><span>Proof of age (applicants must be at least 18 years old)</span></li>\n<li><span>Proof of permanent residency (Australian citizenship)</span></li>\n<li><span>If you&rsquo;re an existing NAB customer, you'll need your NAB ID number</span></li>\n<li><span>For some accounts you may need your tax file number</span></li>\n</ul>","hasContent":true,"hasRepaymentWidget":false,"logo":"//production-ultimate-assets.ratecity.com.au/ratecity/image/upload/v1506320485/company/vetn6qa0xuizog8rhhpm.png","metadata":{"google":{},"og":{},"textContent":"<p><a class=\"rc-keyword\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/nab\">NAB</a>’s Reward Saver account has no monthly fees and no transaction fees.

Products like a <a class=\"rc-keyword\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/citibank\">Citibank</a> savings account can help you reach short- and long-term financial goals. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, there are some savings account limitations you should be aware of before signing the dotted line. We&rsquo;re going to look at the key traits of products like <a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/citibank\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rc-keyword\">Citibank</a> savings accounts, and how these play an important role in any saver&rsquo;s broader financial strategy. </span></p>\n<h3>How does a savings account work?</h3>\n<p><span>Savings account are designed to help your money grow, without exposing funds to market risk. Typically, a bank savings account will offer higher interest rates than a transaction account, and will have mechanisms in place to make your money more difficult to access. </span></p>\n<p><span>Many people open an online savings account in conjunction with their everyday transaction account, transferring funds into the savings account regularly to take advantage of the superior interest rate. </span></p>\n<h3>What different bank accounts are available?</h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for the best savings account, most financial institutions like Citibank will have multiple options available. Bank account comparison can be difficult, but it&rsquo;s important to test the market so you have the right product to suit your financial goals. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Savings account &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to store money you won&rsquo;t need straight away, a savings account could be an ideal solution. High-interest savings accounts can be a convenient, easy way to increase your wealth, without exposing it to market risk. It is important to note, however, these accounts are generally not as accessible as traditional transactional accounts, and often require a minimum deposit amount when opening. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Transactional account &ndash;</span></strong><span> These bank accounts are set up to make managing the money you use on a day-to-day basis simple. Your money can be easily accessed via debit cards, ATMs or the internet to meet regular expenses, although these accounts typically offer inferior interest rates when compared to savings account options. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Term deposits &ndash;</span></strong><span> These financial products are set up a little differently to traditional bank accounts, and there are advantages and disadvantages. A term deposit keeps your money in an account for a set period of time. You won&rsquo;t be able to access your funds during that period, but you will earn a fixed rate of interest on this money. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What should I look for when choosing a savings account?</h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a savings account from Citibank or any other financial institution, there are several factors you should consider before signing the dotted line:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>What&rsquo;s the interest rate? &ndash;</span></strong><span> The savings account interest rate should be a key factor when deciding upon which account is the best fit for you. It&rsquo;s important to note interest rates vary. Some financial institutions offer superior rates as an &lsquo;introductory bonus&rsquo; that expire after a few months. Read the fine print, and make sure you&rsquo;re comfortable with the interest rate.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Are there fees? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Regular admin and account-keeping fees can chew into any interest you&rsquo;ve earned on your account. Test the market and make sure you&rsquo;ve selected a savings account with fees that you can manage, and that won&rsquo;t jeopardise your ability to earn interest. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>What are the minimum and maximum account balances? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Many high-interest savings accounts have minimum and maximum account balances you&rsquo;re required to uphold. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Will it require a linked account? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Many savings accounts require a linked transactional account, which will help the account owners manage their funds. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Is the account offered by an authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI)? &ndash;</span></strong><span> These accounts are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and authorised by the government to offer bank account products to consumers. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of savings accounts?</h3>\n<p><span>The best savings accounts can find a place in many people&rsquo;s personal financial plan, but it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the positives and negatives of these financial products.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Pros</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Higher interest rate &ndash;</span></strong><span> Savings accounts provide an effective way to boost your account, typically offering higher interest rates than normal transactional accounts. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Accessibility &ndash;</span></strong><span> Savings accounts generally let you withdraw money whenever you want, however you may lose bonus interest when making withdrawals. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Features &ndash; </span></strong><span>Many savings accounts offer features like automatic savings plans, which can potentially make it easier to manage your personal finances. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Relatively safe &ndash;</span></strong><span> If your savings account is opened with an ADI, the government will guarantee up to $250,000 if the lender goes bust. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>Cons </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Variable interest rates &ndash; </span></strong><span>Savings account interest rates are subject to change, and depend upon announcements from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and each lender&rsquo;s policies. Potentially, this could see your savings account receiving a lower interest rate down the track. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Accessibility &ndash;</span></strong><span> The temptation to spend money in a highly accessible savings account might be high, which reduces the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll save it. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>No lock-in periods &ndash;</span></strong><span> This can potentially reduce the incentive to commit to regular deposits.</span></li>\n</ul>","hasContent":true,"hasRepaymentWidget":false,"logo":"//production-ultimate-assets.ratecity.com.au/ratecity/image/upload/v1506319727/company/mldtlhvwzr3xhimwqel7.png","metadata":{"google":{},"og":{},"textContent":"<p><a class=\"rc-keyword\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/citibank\">Citibank</a> gives customers the choice of two savings accounts – Online Saver and Ultimate Saver.

It is an account separate from your everyday transaction account where you can set aside money for your savings plan. It can also be used as an emergency fund, should you need the extra cash.</p>\n<p>A savings account generally has no monthly fee, along with a competitive and ongoing interest rate. There are different types of savings accounts, some with withdrawal restrictions and others with a bit more withdrawal flexibility.</p>\n<p>Deciding which savings account is for you depends on your savings plan.</p>\n<h3>What are the types of HSBC savings accounts?</h3>\n<p>Many banks, including <a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/hsbc\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rc-keyword\">HSBC</a>, offer certain types of savings accounts that would best suit your specific saving plans, whether you want to buy a gadget, a car, a house&mdash;or even something as simple as a nice pair of shoes.</p>\n<p><strong>High-interest savings accounts</strong></p>\n<p>High-interest savings accounts usually offer relatively high interest rates and often don&rsquo;t have account service fees either. Commonly, there are certain conditions you have to meet if you want to earn the highest level of interest. These conditions can come in the form of meeting a certain net balance requirement or having withdrawal restrictions. But if you do meet the conditions, you&rsquo;re likely to become a better saver and meet your savings goals faster.</p>\n<p>HSBC offers savings accounts that do require a certain net balance before interest is paid, while other accounts will not pay you interest if you withdraw.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some HSBC accounts also offer higher interest rates that directly correspond to how much money you put in. This encourages customers to put in more money so they can benefit from a higher interest rate, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum-deposit savings account</strong></p>\n<p>This is also a common type of savings account offered in banks. HSBC has its own name for this, of course, but it essentially functions the same way. With a minimum-deposit savings account, you will only receive interest &ndash; or even a bonus interest, depending on the specific product &ndash; if you meet a minimum deposit requirement.</p>\n<p>Many lenders also have a type of savings account that will require you to increase your net balance by a particular amount by the last business day of every month. Failure to do so usually means you will not be paid the interest rate for that month and you might even be faced a penalty or fee.</p>\n<p>The good news is that this gives you an incentive to consistently contribute, which will in turn boost your savings in the long run. Regularly contributing to this account also ensures that your savings goals will be met eventually &ndash; and it will make you a better saver in the long run, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Term deposit account</strong></p>\n<p>A term deposit account would be a good option for customers who are looking for a fixed interest rate for a fixed period of time (often called a &lsquo;term&rsquo;). Whatever amount is deposited there will stay in the account for the entire term, which could be anywhere from one month to five years. Over this period of time, the interest rate is guaranteed to remain the same.</p>\n<p>You may only withdraw the amount you have placed into this account at the end of the nominated period. However, if you do choose to withdraw before the nominated period, there are usually penalties attached. This is ideal for customers who want to protect their investments from the fluctuations of the share market.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard savings account</strong></p>\n<p>HSBC, like many other banks, also offers an everyday savings account. Although the interest rates aren&rsquo;t as high as other types of savings accounts, getting a standard savings account is still a good way to start off your financial planning.</p>\n<p>A good number of HSBC&rsquo;s various savings accounts allow you easy access to your money. Their online banking system allows you to monitor and manage your finances from anywhere, anytime, be it through a laptop or a mobile phone.</p>\n<p>RateCity has its very own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/hsbc\">HSBC savings account interest calculator</a> should you be interested in looking at different borrowing scenarios. You may also compare the HSBC savings accounts with other products to see what would best suit your financial goals.</p>\n<p>The HSBC website also offers an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://partners.leadfusion.com/tools/hsbc2/savings02/tool.fcs\">online tool</a> which will help you figure out how much your savings will be worth should you get an HSBC savings account.

It is an account separate from your everyday transaction account where you can set aside money for your savings plan. It can also be used as an emergency fund, should you need the extra cash.</p>\n<p>A savings account generally has no monthly fee, along with a competitive and ongoing interest rate. There are different types of savings accounts, some with withdrawal restrictions and others with a bit more withdrawal flexibility.</p>\n<p>Deciding which savings account is for you depends on your savings plan.</p>\n<h3>What are the types of HSBC savings accounts?</h3>\n<p>Many banks, including <a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/hsbc\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rc-keyword\">HSBC</a>, offer certain types of savings accounts that would best suit your specific saving plans, whether you want to buy a gadget, a car, a house&mdash;or even something as simple as a nice pair of shoes.</p>\n<p><strong>High-interest savings accounts</strong></p>\n<p>High-interest savings accounts usually offer relatively high interest rates and often don&rsquo;t have account service fees either. Commonly, there are certain conditions you have to meet if you want to earn the highest level of interest. These conditions can come in the form of meeting a certain net balance requirement or having withdrawal restrictions. But if you do meet the conditions, you&rsquo;re likely to become a better saver and meet your savings goals faster.</p>\n<p>HSBC offers savings accounts that do require a certain net balance before interest is paid, while other accounts will not pay you interest if you withdraw.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some HSBC accounts also offer higher interest rates that directly correspond to how much money you put in. This encourages customers to put in more money so they can benefit from a higher interest rate, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum-deposit savings account</strong></p>\n<p>This is also a common type of savings account offered in banks. HSBC has its own name for this, of course, but it essentially functions the same way. With a minimum-deposit savings account, you will only receive interest &ndash; or even a bonus interest, depending on the specific product &ndash; if you meet a minimum deposit requirement.</p>\n<p>Many lenders also have a type of savings account that will require you to increase your net balance by a particular amount by the last business day of every month. Failure to do so usually means you will not be paid the interest rate for that month and you might even be faced a penalty or fee.</p>\n<p>The good news is that this gives you an incentive to consistently contribute, which will in turn boost your savings in the long run. Regularly contributing to this account also ensures that your savings goals will be met eventually &ndash; and it will make you a better saver in the long run, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Term deposit account</strong></p>\n<p>A term deposit account would be a good option for customers who are looking for a fixed interest rate for a fixed period of time (often called a &lsquo;term&rsquo;). Whatever amount is deposited there will stay in the account for the entire term, which could be anywhere from one month to five years. Over this period of time, the interest rate is guaranteed to remain the same.</p>\n<p>You may only withdraw the amount you have placed into this account at the end of the nominated period. However, if you do choose to withdraw before the nominated period, there are usually penalties attached. This is ideal for customers who want to protect their investments from the fluctuations of the share market.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard savings account</strong></p>\n<p>HSBC, like many other banks, also offers an everyday savings account. Although the interest rates aren&rsquo;t as high as other types of savings accounts, getting a standard savings account is still a good way to start off your financial planning.</p>\n<p>A good number of HSBC&rsquo;s various savings accounts allow you easy access to your money. Their online banking system allows you to monitor and manage your finances from anywhere, anytime, be it through a laptop or a mobile phone.</p>\n<p>RateCity has its very own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/savings-accounts/hsbc\">HSBC savings account interest calculator</a> should you be interested in looking at different borrowing scenarios.

No two savings accounts are created equal.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, if you wanted to split your income between an amount for saving and a budget for spending, you could do this by using different savings accounts. </span></p>\n<h3>Savings accounts v transaction accounts</h3>\n<p><span>Regular transaction accounts are good for spending. A transaction account (because you&rsquo;re likely to use it frequently) generally has no or low monthly account-keeping fees.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many transaction accounts offer you the choice of a debit card, along with a regular bank card and free use of specific ATMs throughout Australia. </span></p>\n<p><span>These extra benefits are designed so that you can access your money regularly and at little or no cost.

Products like a <a class=\"rc-keyword\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/citibank\">Citibank</a> savings account can help you reach short- and long-term financial goals. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, there are some savings account limitations you should be aware of before signing the dotted line. We&rsquo;re going to look at the key traits of products like <a href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/citibank\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rc-keyword\">Citibank</a> savings accounts, and how these play an important role in any saver&rsquo;s broader financial strategy. </span></p>\n<h3>How does a savings account work?</h3>\n<p><span>Savings account are designed to help your money grow, without exposing funds to market risk. Typically, a bank savings account will offer higher interest rates than a transaction account, and will have mechanisms in place to make your money more difficult to access. </span></p>\n<p><span>Many people open an online savings account in conjunction with their everyday transaction account, transferring funds into the savings account regularly to take advantage of the superior interest rate. </span></p>\n<h3>What different bank accounts are available?</h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re on the hunt for the best savings account, most financial institutions like Citibank will have multiple options available. Bank account comparison can be difficult, but it&rsquo;s important to test the market so you have the right product to suit your financial goals. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Savings account &ndash;</span></strong><span> If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to store money you won&rsquo;t need straight away, a savings account could be an ideal solution. High-interest savings accounts can be a convenient, easy way to increase your wealth, without exposing it to market risk. It is important to note, however, these accounts are generally not as accessible as traditional transactional accounts, and often require a minimum deposit amount when opening. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Transactional account &ndash;</span></strong><span> These bank accounts are set up to make managing the money you use on a day-to-day basis simple. Your money can be easily accessed via debit cards, ATMs or the internet to meet regular expenses, although these accounts typically offer inferior interest rates when compared to savings account options. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Term deposits &ndash;</span></strong><span> These financial products are set up a little differently to traditional bank accounts, and there are advantages and disadvantages. A term deposit keeps your money in an account for a set period of time. You won&rsquo;t be able to access your funds during that period, but you will earn a fixed rate of interest on this money. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What should I look for when choosing a savings account?</h3>\n<p><span>If you&rsquo;re in the market for a savings account from Citibank or any other financial institution, there are several factors you should consider before signing the dotted line:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>What&rsquo;s the interest rate? &ndash;</span></strong><span> The savings account interest rate should be a key factor when deciding upon which account is the best fit for you. It&rsquo;s important to note interest rates vary. Some financial institutions offer superior rates as an &lsquo;introductory bonus&rsquo; that expire after a few months. Read the fine print, and make sure you&rsquo;re comfortable with the interest rate.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Are there fees? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Regular admin and account-keeping fees can chew into any interest you&rsquo;ve earned on your account. Test the market and make sure you&rsquo;ve selected a savings account with fees that you can manage, and that won&rsquo;t jeopardise your ability to earn interest. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>What are the minimum and maximum account balances? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Many high-interest savings accounts have minimum and maximum account balances you&rsquo;re required to uphold. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Will it require a linked account? &ndash;</span></strong><span> Many savings accounts require a linked transactional account, which will help the account owners manage their funds. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Is the account offered by an authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI)? &ndash;</span></strong><span> These accounts are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and authorised by the government to offer bank account products to consumers. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the pros and cons of savings accounts?</h3>\n<p><span>The best savings accounts can find a place in many people&rsquo;s personal financial plan, but it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the positives and negatives of these financial products.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Pros</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Higher interest rate &ndash;</span></strong><span> Savings accounts provide an effective way to boost your account, typically offering higher interest rates than normal transactional accounts. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Accessibility &ndash;</span></strong><span> Savings accounts generally let you withdraw money whenever you want, however you may lose bonus interest when making withdrawals. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Features &ndash; </span></strong><span>Many savings accounts offer features like automatic savings plans, which can potentially make it easier to manage your personal finances. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Relatively safe &ndash;</span></strong><span> If your savings account is opened with an ADI, the government will guarantee up to $250,000 if the lender goes bust. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>Cons </span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Variable interest rates &ndash; </span></strong><span>Savings account interest rates are subject to change, and depend upon announcements from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and each lender&rsquo;s policies. Potentially, this could see your savings account receiving a lower interest rate down the track. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Accessibility &ndash;</span></strong><span> The temptation to spend money in a highly accessible savings account might be high, which reduces the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll save it. </span></li>\n<li><strong><span>No lock-in periods &ndash;</span></strong><span> This can potentially reduce the incentive to commit to regular deposits.</span></li>\n</ul>","hasContent":true,"hasRepaymentWidget":false,"logo":"//production-ultimate-assets.ratecity.com.au/ratecity/image/upload/v1506319727/company/mldtlhvwzr3xhimwqel7.png","metadata":{"google":{},"og":{},"textContent":"<p><a class=\"rc-keyword\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.ratecity.com.au/companies/citibank\">Citibank</a> gives customers the choice of two savings accounts – Online Saver and Ultimate Saver.

No-one comes after you with a big stick. Instead what they’ll typically do is start applying the standard interest rate on what’s likely to be a significant credit card debt.</p>\n<p>“The card provided will also go back to asking for just the minimum repayments, which could see your debt spiral out of control.</p>\n<p>“One alternative for big ticket items is to take out a low rate <a href=\"https://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/best?pl_showAll=true&ab_test_id=0\">personal loan</a>. They force people to make regular repayments to pay off the debt in full, without the temptation to rack up more debt.</p>\n<p>“Buy now, pay later services, such as Afterpay, are another option. With no interest and no upfront fees, it’s a cheap way to secure credit – provided you don’t miss any repayments.</p>\n<p>“The problem with Afterpay is that the service is predominantly used for non-essential items. It’s one thing to borrow money to replace a broken fridge or to pay the gas bill, but when it comes to luxury items, we’d recommend people finance it the old fashion way – save up for it,” she said.</p>\n<h4>Credit card repayment plans &#8211; potential traps</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Not meeting a repayment, and getting charged the standard purchase rate.</li>\n<li>Failing to clear the debt within the repayment period.</li>\n<li>Losing your interest free days on purchases you put on a repayment plan.</li>\n<li>Paying fees to use the service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Note: the terms and conditions are different for each card.

No-one comes after you with a big stick. Instead what they’ll typically do is start applying the standard interest rate on what’s likely to be a significant credit card debt.</p>\n<p>“The card provided will also go back to asking for just the minimum repayments, which could see your debt spiral out of control.</p>\n<p>“One alternative for big ticket items is to take out a low rate <a href=\"https://www.ratecity.com.au/personal-loans/best?pl_showAll=true&ab_test_id=0\">personal loan</a>. They force people to make regular repayments to pay off the debt in full, without the temptation to rack up more debt.</p>\n<p>“Buy now, pay later services, such as Afterpay, are another option. With no interest and no upfront fees, it’s a cheap way to secure credit – provided you don’t miss any repayments.</p>\n<p>“The problem with Afterpay is that the service is predominantly used for non-essential items. It’s one thing to borrow money to replace a broken fridge or to pay the gas bill, but when it comes to luxury items, we’d recommend people finance it the old fashion way – save up for it,” she said.</p>\n<h4>Credit card repayment plans &#8211; potential traps</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Not meeting a repayment, and getting charged the standard purchase rate.</li>\n<li>Failing to clear the debt within the repayment period.</li>\n<li>Losing your interest free days on purchases you put on a repayment plan.</li>\n<li>Paying fees to use the service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Note: the terms and conditions are different for each card.
