However, You won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the membership fee paid for the then-current membership period. By purchasing the 1 (one) calendar month membership, You authorize AsianDate.com to charge Your credit card, debit card or other payment method at such time and again, as Your membership will automatically renew at the beginning of any subsequent membership period, unless canceled by You prior to the expiration of any membership period, including any sales or similar taxes imposed on Your membership payments. Unless otherwise indicated in any applicable additional terms or communications AsianDate.com sends to Your registered email address, the renewal membership will be at the same membership fee as when you first subscribed (unless your first month was purchased at a promotional rate), plus any applicable taxes, unless AsianDate.com notifies You at least 10 days prior to the end of your current term that the membership fee will increase. You acknowledge and agree that your payment method will be automatically charged for such membership fees, plus any applicable taxes, upon each such automatic renewal. You acknowledge that your membership is subject to automatic renewals and You consent to and accept responsibility for all recurring charges to your credit or debit card (or other payment method, as applicable) based on this automatic renewal feature without further authorization from You and without further notice except as required by law. In the event Your credit card, debit card or other payment method chosen by You to renew Your membership is declined, You authorize Amolatina.com to charge any other credit card, debit card or bank account listed on file with your membership account. You further acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may change if the applicable tax rates change or if you are notified that there will be an increase in the applicable membership fees. Upon the renewal of Your membership, if AsianDate.com does not receive payment, You agree that AsianDate.com may either terminate or suspend your membership and continue to attempt to charge Your payment method provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new membership commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received). Upon de-activation of Your membership, all privileges associates with Your membership shall be revoked, provided that Your profile shall remain searchable by other Members. You shall retain the right to browse other Members’ profiles and to make changes to Your own profile. You may re-activate your membership by signing up and paying the membership fee.

Furthermore, the Correspondent shall not be entitled to any unused credits with respect to his correspondence with such female Member. AsianDate may, at its discretion, issue 10 credits back to Correspondent’s account for Correspondent's last letter to the female Member, if this letter was the last one in their correspondence.

          Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to the Websites or to products or services sold or distributed by AsianDate or through AsianDate will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.
         </b>
         The arbitration shall take place in the city of New York, state of New York. New York law will govern the rights and obligations of the parties hereto with respect to the matters in controversy.
         <b>
          There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. But an arbitrator can award you the same damages and relief, and must honor the same terms in this agreement, as a court would.

         To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitrator will allocate all costs and fees attributable to the arbitration between the parties hereto equally.

THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

If parties are unable to resolve the dispute, You must use the dispute resolution mechanism discussed above in this Section 14. You specifically acknowledge and agree that You will not attempt to chargeback any charges you authorized if you used the goods and/or Services provided. You further agree that should AsianDate demonstrate that a chargeback was unjustifiable, You shall incur an additional administrative charge of five cents ($ .05) cents per dollar of the amount of the chargeback. Such charge is not intended as a penalty, rather it shall be used to cover the administrative expenses incurred by AsianDate in connection with the chargeback. You shall also be required to pay any and all fees assessed by a credit card, bank or any other third party with respect to the chargeback which may range from $20 to $200 per chargeback, together with any reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs incurred by AsianDate with respect to the reversal of said chargeback. Please also note should you chargeback any transactions billed to your account, AsianDate may be required to disclose any and/or all private communications sent/received by You through our Service in order to prove the validity of the charges billed to Your account and AsianDate’s privacy policy will therefore not restrain any such disclosures.

       Anti-Scam Policy
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div id="ucContent_cPLHldrAuthPageMaster_pnlContent">
       <div class="padTop10">
        Adoreasia.com is a division of the Anastasia International Group of Introduction and Romance Tour companies, a dedicated leader in the fight against fraudulent activity and dating scams. Built upon 17 years of expertise, Adoreasia spearheads the ongoing fight against scam activities and formulates strong and enduring policies to tackle fraudulent practices.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Scammers are a terrible blight to our industry and can cause distress and financial loss to those looking to date and possible marry an Asian lady. In cooperation with clients, agencies, law enforcement and other legislative bodies, Adoreasia goes to great lengths to ensure all measures are in place to punish offenders and prevent fraud. The dedication, dependability and vigilance are of great service to our customers and put us right at the top of the industry.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        The global matchmaking network comprises a majority of trustworthy agencies who endeavor to provide customers with high-quality, reliable services. Unfortunately over time a number of crooked agencies have become involved and made an attempt to poison an otherwise honest industry with malpractice.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Drawing on the knowhow of Anastasia, Adoreasia leads the way in anti-scam policy and technology. Other anti-scam agencies may adhere to honest practices, but Adoreasia has a far more intensive approach to tackling fraud. Integrity is not the only quality necessary to fight scam; Adoreasia operates a watertight scheme to weed out scam suspects and bring down the full force of the law on those who step out of line.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Tracking the movements of fraud and taking immediate action is the key to effective anti-scam policy. Adoreasia operates a highly advanced system that makes it the industry's most comprehensive anti-scam option available in the world today. Large agencies draw from a number of satellite agencies across Asia that signup ladies and fulfill customer requests on a local level. Therefore, if the main agency undertakes duties on behalf of a paying client, it is usually subject to the cooperation of several satellite agencies that carry out the work in the lady's own town or city in Asia. So even if the main agency is respectable, there's still reliance upon the agencies further down the ladder. If these smaller agencies, or indeed the women onsite, act unlawfully and undertake scam practices, then the customer will experience problems even if the 'home' agency is completely above board. This is why it's essential that all agencies have more than just honesty to tackle scam and ensure an untarnished name.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Adoreasia operates the tried and tested anti-scam strategy of Anastasia, who has invested the last 10 years and over one million dollars on this mission. This leading anti-scam strategy operates to uncover harmful agencies while commending those agencies that are praiseworthy. This company mission of setting up a powerful anti-scam project to protect clients has been a scrupulous and high-cost challenge. However, we believe it has been vital as a guiding light to bring justice and fairness to the industry. Adoreasia.com takes a winning anti-scam approach and consistently applies it to a range of agencies, resulting in unmatched client safety and fraud prevention.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10 redText b">
        Anti-Scam Mission
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        The comprehensive capital and hard work pumped into this project is unparalleled. Based on these efforts, Adoreasia will never relent in its anti-scam endeavor and continually appraises its agencies throughout Asia to ensure they abide by US law such as the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act (IMBRA) of 2005. It is this mission that has led Adoreasia to frequently review and upgrade its good practice.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        <ul class="text">
         <li>
          Adoreasia, in tandem with its associated websites, is the solitary agency with a specialized, proactive team that observes chat and letters in order to detect irregular practice and take steps to tackle scam in response to customer complaints.
         </li>
         <li>
          Upon detection of likely scam or fraud onsite, Adoreasia acts fast to strike at the root of the problem with a direct investigation. A full report is carried out, following which the customer is informed of the action taken.
         </li>
         <li>
          If actual scam is detected, the offending profile is struck off the list and her agency penalized. The customer is reimbursed for the loss they suffered due to the direct fraud involving the guilty party.
         </li>
         <li>
          If we discover an agency is guilty of further offences they then face even higher penalties.
         </li>
         <li>
          After four cases of fraud an agency is completely deleted from our system and Adoreasia will never work with them again.
         </li>
         <li>
          Our customer care department screens every lady signed up to Adoreasia.com. The checking process involves (1) proof of the lady's ID (2) notification that the lady has been entered into our system (3) verification that the lady would like to find a husband from the West.
         </li>
         <li>
          Adoreasia is a member of the only network to fully screen all ladies in its system. Other agencies connected to global matchmaking only use their satellite agency to confirm a woman's ID.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        The global matchmaking industry has shifted dramatically since it first began. The birth of the industry came from an abundance of specialty agencies helping Western men to find a lady using
        <i>
         postal mail
        </i>
        contact. In the beginning, such mini agencies profited by supplying the postal addresses of registered women to American agencies, who would then relay the details to their gentlemen clients. This system all changed when the internet began to dominate, with a surge of dating sites based on email exchange. Because the postal addresses were no longer required, agencies were not able to continually sell on such information.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Now times have changed, these mini agencies are now required to have day-to-day cooperation with lady clients to encourage them to check and reply to mail, and have an onsite presence. Such agencies cannot rest on their laurels and wait for repeated income; they now have to work hard to achieve success. However, a small percentage of agencies became displeased with the altered business model. Some saw our business conditions of fraud prosecution and penalties as overbearing.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        The reality is that the power balance has shifted and such agencies are no longer able to benefit from selling a
        <i>
         product
        </i>
        (i.e. lady's addresses), and they must offer different services to our customers. Although it's inevitable that a minority of agencies will be dissatisfied, the majority have adapted to the new rules and found them to be very successful. These agencies see the changes as a positive step forward for customers loaded with new opportunities.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        We have kept the same stance with all agencies from the beginning — scamming our customers is the same as scamming us and will be continually penalized. Most agencies have done well out of the system with larger offices and expansion into other cities. Therefore, Adoreasia is a cheerleader for all those agencies who are upbeat, hands on and thriving. They are an inspiration to everyone and great for the industry as a whole.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10 redText b">
        Getting the Lowdown
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        A high number of men wrongly believe that getting in touch through the internet is the only step required to find a Woman. This approach is well wide of the mark. Communicating through live online chat or mail is highly valuable but should be used carefully; it gives you a chance to screen Asian women before you spend money travelling to Asia. Once you take your potential relationship offline there can never be any absolute certainties.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Face-to-face contact should be the ultimate aim for any relationship once you've made progress using emails and phone calls. Online communication can NEVER be considered as a replacement for a real relationship. A high number of men perceive emails and live chat as the start of something but this is a risky state of play.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        The start to a fulfilling relationship is more complex than sending a few messages from a computer and expecting a lady to appear as if by magic. In order to move from first contact with an Asian lady to the dream of walking up the aisle on your wedding day, it's FUNDAMENTAL that you meet up with her early on. Getting in touch beforehand is a good way to whittle down your options and choose whether to travel and meet or not. It's a necessary step to take after a period of online communication between a man and a woman. Until you reach this point a real relationship will not exist between you and your chosen lady.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        The method used to get in touch for the first time is the same for men and women – create an online profile that offers an insight into your personality and interests. Once this has been set up, it's necessary to compose a more in-depth "introduction letter" that contains more personal information, dreams and aspirations.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        These introduction letters serve the purpose to target men and women and give a more individual feel than is possible through a personal profile. It constitutes a speedy method for gentlemen to contact as many women as possible. And this contact is the sole purpose of such practice.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        All parties involved dispatch large numbers of letters in order to ascertain the man or woman they wish to pair off with. The global matchmaking industry was founded on this basis and continues to operate in such a manner. Adoreasia is one of the proactive agencies that leave no stone unturned until a match is found, with dynamic circulation of introduction letters an extra service.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Adoreasia carries out a letter introduction service that pairs American men with women from a large number of satellite agencies across Asia. These agencies sign up and add all qualifying ladies to a central database. Many of these satellite agencies then undertake elite matchmaking services for their lady members by reviewing the Adoreasia database of men and dispatching a lady's introduction letter to those men who seem compatible. Adoreasia believes this to be a worthy and helpful service – one that brings together men and women in a positive way. On the other hand, if an agency then sends more letters for a lady member after the initial letter, Adoreasia regards this as scamming which is duly punished.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Some clients mistakenly assume that an agency can control a lady's behavior just because her photo is on their site. Unfortunately, this is not the case as no agency can instinctively know any registered man or woman has a good character. It's impossible to psycho-analyze someone and predict with complete certainty that they will behave badly and commit fraud.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        The most effective agency is one that constantly monitors online activity and takes immediate action if anything fraudulent occurs. Adoreasia has an open door policy that welcomes any customer to report suspicious activity involving any member. Once a complaint has been logged, we look into the matter and take action where necessary. Lessons are learned from every incident of suspected scam, and extra measures are put into place if required.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        In all occurrences of suspected or actual fraud, Adoreasia advises that members should use this experience in a beneficial way as part of the process of weeding out suspicious members. Such disrespectful activity gives you the whole picture of how to approach your dating strategy. If you discover that a lady is not being candid and open with you then clearly she's not worth pursuing any further. It's important that you learn this early on with the assistance of the Adoreasia anti-scam policy.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        To inform Adoreasia of a bad experience involving someone you're in contact with, just email the details to us immediately. It's our duty to investigate your complaint and let you know the outcome and any action taken. If we do not find proof of fraud then this will be set out with a clear and fair explanation. If we do detect evidence of scam, then we'll reimburse any loss of credits or money and penalize the offender in question who will be removed from our database. Such action is the only way any agency can make a difference and successfully address fraud. Adoreasia is at the forefront of scam busting and will forever remain vigilant.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10 redText b">
        Summary
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        To rid the industry of fraud completely is an impossible aim even with a leading anti-scam strategy like ours. This is why the best approach is to clamp down heavily on offenders every step of the way and make an example of them. They should know that such behavior simply won't be tolerated.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        To date Adoreasia has stopped countless episodes of scam and punished the perpetrators accordingly. However, it's never possible to foresee such criminal behavior in advance. The best way to tackle scam is to kill it dead as soon as it appears. For instance, each week we process in the region of 400,000 emails and a non-stop flow of live chat messages. From this number, around 20-30 scam incidents are reported every week, with 50% of complaints lacking evidence or justification.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Adoreasia has a great responsibility on its shoulders when it comes to policing online communication and the related social issues. Dealing with a huge number of agencies is a titanic task and achieving a successful balance has been a minefield. The reality is we've tackled scam and kicked out the guilty parties.
       </div>
       <div class="padTop10">
        Our paramount achievement is that customers keep coming back due to our attention to detail, unique service and protective environment. We plan to make it stay that way.
