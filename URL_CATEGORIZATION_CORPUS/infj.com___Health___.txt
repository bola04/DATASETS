               It's worth
noting that I don't include much "ISs do this" and "TJs do that" on this site.  This is the wrong site if
that's what you're
looking for. I work with type as a depth psychology rather than as a descriptive psychology the way most people use it.  I
feel type is systemic and wholistic, and too much letter talk ends up being
restrictive rather than empowering.  That especially goes for that last letter -- J/P -- which
has all manner of inaccurate stereotypes associated with it.

               I utilize a
slightly different approach to type than most type users.  I don't box people in
using four dichotomies the way the MBTI is designed to do.  I'm trying to
get people
               <i>
                out
               </i>
               of boxes they may be in without realizing it! I strive to
treat the functions as verbs, and believe we all have the
potential to develop those verbs.  (I dislike restricting anyone's
potential!)  At the same time, I believe we're born a certain type, and we
flower into that type through the course of our lives and through its many
seasons.  (Perhaps this seems
like a paradox, but isn't that the nature of being human?)

               Type is an
organized model of consciousness, so I look to it as a model of
development.  It also describes our limitations, so you won't find much "alphabet soup" here, and I treat the code as
a starting point rather than an end-point.   I also don't wax lyrical about "the test," because it's highly fallible (especially those
online freebies that misrepresent type).

              web project?  Okay, twist my arm and I'll tell
you.  #1 Because I got tired of people
misunderstanding what the INFJ pattern looks like or how it manifests. 
      #2 It seems that people are hungry to learn more about type, but they
      don't know how to access or utilize this knowledge on a day-to-day
      basis.  #3 Because I got tired of type being treated like "trait"
theory, and wanted to fight back against broad, sweeping (need I say
inappropriate?) generalizations based on limited understandings of type. As you will soon discover, I have some passion around
      applying type, especially
when it comes to exploring my own particular type code, and this website seems like
the best outlet for expressing myself.  So I'm
really creating this site for myself as much as
      anything.  I'll be quoting and citing a variety of sources, so it's not just my
      voice you'll hear!  (I confess I also sneak a little bit of life
coaching in along the way.)

               I add
additional data whenever the spirit moves me -- I have little collections, computer
documents, varied scraps of paper, and xeroxes piled around that someday may coalesce into a
new page, a new paragraph, a new phrase.  I started this site in 2001, and probably have some of the most sophisticated type information available (I get plagiarized a lot!).  But there's no grand strategy -- the
100+ pages on this site somehow mushroomed into what you see now.

      those who want to be on the "cutting edge" of Type theory, let me recommend
      my Virtual Type Workshop.  I'm one of the first individuals to promote the eight-function model of type, and I created a program drawing on expert knowledge that teaches the eight functions of psychological types.  (This is superior to speculation about the functions that I've encountered all over the internet -- for the price of one typical visit to Target you can learn from real experts, and not the fake ones!)
