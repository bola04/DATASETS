    Required properties are:
      og:url, og:type, og:title, og:description, og:image, and fb:app_id
    If og:image is not used, Facebook will notice the Twitter meta tags below 
    and use a twitter icon for the page's image, which is undesirable, so I put 
    in an empty og:image for now.

         Information is neither matter nor energy, although it needs matter to be embodied and energy to be communicated. Why should it become the preferred basis for all philosophy?
         <p>
         </p>
         As most all of us know, matter and energy are
         <i>
          conserved
         </i>
         . This means that there is just the same total amount of matter and energy today as there was at the universe origin.
         <p>
         </p>
         But then what accounts for all the change that we see, the new things under the sun? It is
         <i>
          information
         </i>
         , which is
         <i>
          not conserved
         </i>
         and has been increasing since the beginning of time, despite the second law of thermodynamics, with its increasing entropy, which destroys order.
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         What is changing is the
         <i>
          arrangement
         </i>
         of the matter into what we can call
         <i>
          information structures
         </i>
         . 
What is
         <a href="/knowledge/emergence.html">
          emerging
         </a>
         is
         <i>
          new information
         </i>
         . What idealists and holists see is that emergence of
         <i>
          immaterial
         </i>
         information.
         <p>
         </p>
         Living things, you and I, are dynamic growing
         <i>
          information structures
         </i>
         ,
         <i>
          forms
         </i>
         through which matter and energy continuously flow. And it is information processing that controls those flows!
         <p>
         </p>
         At the lowest levels, living information structures blindly replicate their information. At higher levels, natural selection adapts them to their environments. At the highest levels, living things develop behaviors, intentions, goals, and
         <a href="/mind/agency/">
          agency
         </a>
         , introducing
         <a href="/mind/purpose/">
          purpose
         </a>
         into the universe.
         <p>
         </p>
         Information is the modern
         <i>
          spirit
         </i>
         , the
         <i>
          ghost in the machine
         </i>
         , the
         <a href="/mind/">
          <i>
           mind
          </i>
         </a>
         in the body. It is the
         <i>
          soul
         </i>
         , and when we die, it is our information that perishes, unless the future preserves it. The matter remains.
         <p>
         </p>
         If we don't remember the past, we don't deserve to be remembered by the future. This is especially true for the custodians of knowledge.

          isomorphism
         </i>
         of the information structures in the external world. Information philosophy is a

         .
         <p>

         Sadly, there is no isomorphism, no information in common, between

         and
         <i>

         Although language is an excellent tool for human communication, it is arbitrary, ambiguous, and ill-suited to
         <i>

         the world directly.  Human languages do not picture reality.

         . Words stimulate neurons to start firing and to play back those experiences that include relevant objects.

         </p>
         Neurons that were wired together in our earliest experiences fire together at later times, contextualizing our new experiences, giving them
         <a href="/knowledge/meaning/">
          meaning
         </a>
         . And by replaying
         <i>
          emotional
         </i>
         reactions to similar earlier experiences, it makes then "subjective experiences," giving us the feeling of "what it's like to be me" and solving the "hard problem" of

         Without words and related experiences previously recorded in your mental experience recorder, we could not comprehend words. They would be mere

         By comparison, a diagram, a photograph, an animation, or a moving picture can be seen and mostly understood by human beings, independent of their native tongue.  The basic elements of information philosophy are
         <i>
          dynamical models of information structures
         </i>
         . They go far beyond logic and language as a
         <i>
          representation
         </i>
         of the fundamental,
         <a href="http://metaphysicist.com/">
          metaphysical
         </a>
         , nature of reality.
         <br/>
         Visual and interactive models "write" directly into our mental experience recorders.
         <p>
         </p>
         Computer animated models must incorporate all the laws of nature, from the differential equations of quantum physics to the myriad information processes of biology. Simulations are not only our most accurate knowledge of the physical world, they are among the best teaching tools ever devised. We can transfer knowledge non-verbally to coming generations in most of the world's population via the Internet and nearly ubiquitous smartphones.

         information, from your original DNA to your latest experiences, will be with you for your lifetime.

         Anyone with a serious interest in philosophy should understand how information is created and destroyed, because information is much more fundamental than the logic and language tools philosophers use today. Information philosophy goes "beyond logic and language."

         should actually be the preferred basis for the critical analysis of current problems in a wide range of disciplines - from information creation in
         <a href="/introduction/creation/">

         to information in
         <a href="/quantum/">

         and the problem of
         <a href="/problems/consciousness/">

         </a>
         . And of course in philosophy, where failed language analysis can be replaced or augmented by
         <i>
          immaterial
         </i>
         information analysis as a basis for justified
         <a href="/knowledge/">

         Above all, information philosophy hopes to replace

         Why has philosophy made so little progress? Is it because
         <i>
          philosophers prefer problems
         </i>
         , while
         <i>
          scientists seek solutions
         </i>
         ? Must a philosophical problem once solved become science and leave philosophy?
         <a href="/solutions/philosophers/russell/">
          Bertrand Russell
         </a>
         thought so. The information philosopher thinks not.
         <p>
         </p>
         Russell said:
         <blockquote>
          "as soon as definite knowledge concerning any subject becomes possible, this subject ceases to be called philosophy, and becomes a separate science...while those only to which, at present, no definite answer can be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy."

         But in order to remain philosophy, interested philosophers must examine our proposed information-based solutions and evaluate them as part of the philosophical dialogue.

         It also turns out that the methodology of information philosophy can be productively applied to some outstanding problems in physics. Philosophers of science might take an interest in the proposed information-based solutions to these problems in the "foundations" of physics.

          What is information?

         <p>
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          A common definition of information is the act of informing - the communication of knowledge from a sender to a receiver that informs (literally shapes) the receiver. Often used as a synonym for knowledge, information traditionally implies that the sender and receiver are human beings, but many animals clearly communicate. Information
          <i>
           theory
          </i>
          studies the
          <i>
           communication
          </i>
          of information.
          <p>
          </p>
          Information
          <i>
           philosophy
          </i>
          extends that study to the communication of information content between material objects, including how it is changed by energetic interactions with the rest of the universe.
          <p>
          </p>
          We call a material object with information content an
          <i>
           information structure
          </i>
          . While information is communicated between inanimate objects, they do not
          <i>
           process
          </i>
          information, which we will show is the defining characteristic of living beings and their artifacts.
          <p>
          </p>
          The sender of information need not be a person, an animal, or even a living thing. It might be a purely material object, a rainbow, for example, sending color information to your eye.
          <p>
          </p>
          The receiver, too, might be merely physical, a molecule of water in that rainbow that receives too few photons and cools to join the formation of a crystal snowflake, increasing its information content.
          <p>
          </p>
          Information
          <i>
           theory
          </i>
          , the mathematical theory of the
          <i>
           communication of information
          </i>
          , says little about
          <i>
           meaning
          </i>
          in a message, which is roughly the
          <i>
           use
          </i>
          to which the information received is put. Information
          <i>
           philosophy
          </i>
          extends the information flows in human communications systems and digital computers to the natural information carried in the energy and material flows between all the information structures in the observable universe.
          <p>
          </p>
          A message that is certain to tell you something you already know contains no
          <i>
           new
          </i>
          information. It does not increase your knowledge, or reduce the
          <a href="/freedom/uncertainty.html">
           uncertainty

          If everything that happens was certain to happen, as
          <a href="/freedom/determinism.html">
           determinist
          </a>
          philosophers claim, no new information would ever enter the universe. Information would be a universal constant. There would be "nothing new under the sun." Every past and future event could in principle be known by a god-like super-intelligence with to a fixed totality of information (
          <a href="/freedom/laplaces_demon.html">
           Laplace's Demon
          </a>
          ).
          <p>
          </p>
          Physics tells us that the total amount of mass and energy in the universe is a constant. The
          <i>
           conservation of mass and energy
          </i>
          is a fundamental law of nature. Some mathematical physicists erroneously think that information should also be a conserved quantity, that information is a constant of nature. This includes some leading mathematical physicists.
          <p>
          </p>
          But information is neither matter nor energy, though it needs matter to be embodied and energy to be communicated. Information can be created and destroyed. The material universe creates it. The biological world creates it
          <i>
           and utilizes
          </i>
          it. Above all, human minds create, process, and preserve information, the
          <a href="/knowledge/sum/">
           <i>
            Sum
           </i>
          </a>
          of human knowledge that distinguishes humanity from all other biological species and that provides the extraordinary power humans have over our planet.
          <p>
          </p>
          Information is the modern spirit, the ghost in the machine, the mind in the body. It is the soul, and when we die, it is our information that perishes. The matter remains.
          <!-- A typical calorie of energy spends less than a minute in our bodies. A typical gram of matter passes through the body in a bit over a week. We are not matter and energy. We are the personal information that persists a lifetime. -->
          <p>
          </p>
          We propose information as an objective
          <a href="/value/">
           value
          </a>
          , the ultimate
          <i>
           sine qua non
          </i>
          .
          <p>
          </p>
          Information philosophy claims that
          <i>
           man is not a machine
          </i>
          and the
          <i>
           brain is not a computer
          </i>
          . Living things
          <i>
           process
          </i>
          information in ways far more complex, if not faster, than the most powerful information processing machines. What biological systems and computing systems have in common is the
          <i>
           processing
          </i>
          of information, as we must explain.
          <p>
          </p>
          Whereas machines are assembled, living things assemble themselves. They are both information structures, patterns, through which matter and energy flows, thanks to flows of negative entropy coming from the Sun and the expanding universe. And they both can create new information, build new structures, and maintain their integrity against the destructive influence of the second law of thermodynamics.
          <p>
          </p>
          Biological evolution began when the first molecule replicated itself, that is, duplicated the information it contained. But
          <i>
           duplication
          </i>
          is mere copying. Biological
          <i>
           reproduction
          </i>
          is a much more sophisticated process in which the germ or seed information of a new living thing is encoded in a data or information structure (a genetic code) that can be communicated to processing systems that produce another instance of the given genus and species.
          <p>
          </p>
          Ontologically random imperfections, along with the deliberate introduction of random noise, for example in sexual recombinations, in the processing systems produce the variations that are selected by evolution based on their reproductive success. Errors are not restricted to the genetic code, occurring throughout the development of each individual up to the present.
          <p>

          How is information created?
         </b>
         <blockquote>
          <i>
           Ex nihilo, nihil fit
          </i>
          , said the ancients,
          <i>
           Nothing comes from nothing
          </i>
          . But information is no (material) thing. Information is
          <i>
           physical
          </i>
          , but it is not
          <i>
           material
          </i>
          . Information is a
          <i>
           property
          </i>
          of material. It is the
          <i>
           form
          </i>
          that matter can take. We can thus create something (immaterial) from nothing! 
But we shall find that it takes a special kind of energy (
          <i>
           free
          </i>
          or available energy, with
          <i>
           negative entropy
          </i>
          ) to do so, because it involves the rearrangement of matter.
          <p>
          </p>
          Energy transfer to or from an object increases or decreases the heat in the object. Entropy transfer does not change the heat content, it represents only a different organization or distribution of the matter in the body. Increasing entropy represents a loss of organization or order, or, more precisely, information. Maximum entropy is maximum disorder and minimal information.
          <p>
          </p>
          As you read this sentence, new information is (we hope) being encoded/embodied in your mind/brain. Permanent changes in the synapses between your neurons store the new information. New synapses are made possible by free energy and material flows in your metabolic system, a tiny part of the negative entropy flows that are coursing throughout the universe. Information philosophy will show you how these tiny mental flows allow you to comprehend and control at least part of the cosmic information flows in the universe.
          <p>
          </p>
          Cosmologists know that information is being
          <a href="/introduction/creation/">
           created
          </a>
          because the universe began some thirteen billion years ago in a state of minimal information. The "Big Bang" started with the most elementary particles and radiation. How matter formed into information structures, first atoms, then the galaxies, stars, and planets, is the beginning of a story that will end with understanding how human minds
          <a href="/knowledge/emergence.html">
           emerged
          </a>
          to understand our place in the universe.
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          The relation between matter and information is straightforward. The embodied information is the organization or arrangement of the matter plus the laws of nature that describe the motions of matter in terms of the fundamental forces that act between all material particles.
          <p>
          </p>
          The relation between information and energy is more complex, and has led to confusion about how to apply mathematical information theory to the physical and biological sciences. Material systems in an equilibrium state are maximally disordered, have maximum entropy, no negative entropy, and no information other than the bulk parameters of the system.
          <p>
          </p>
          In the case of the universe, the initial parameters were very few, the amount of radiant energy (the temperature) and the number of elementary particles (quarks, gluons, electrons, and photons) per unit volume, and the total volume (infinite?). These parameters, and their changes (as a function of time, as the temperature falls) are all the information needed to describe a statistically uniform, isotropic universe and its evolution.
          <p>
          </p>
          Information philosophy will explain the process of information creation in three fundamental realms - the purely material, the biological, and the mental.
          <p>
          </p>
          The first information creation was a kind of "order out of chaos," when matter in the early universe opened up spaces allowing gravitational attraction to condense otherwise randomly distributed matter into highly organized galaxies, stars, and planets. It was the expansion - the increasing space between material objects - that drove the universe away from thermodynamic equilibrium (maximum entropy and disorder) and in some places created
          <i>
           negative entropy
          </i>
          , a quantitative measure of orderly arrangements that is the basis for all information.
          <p>
          </p>
          Purely material objects react to one another following laws of nature, but they do not in an important sense
          <i>
           create
          </i>
          or
          <i>
           process
          </i>
          the information that they contain. It was the expansion, moving faster than the re-equilibration time, and the gravitational forces, that were responsible for the new structures.
          <p>
          </p>
          A qualitatively different kind of information creation was when the first molecule on earth to replicate itself went on to duplicate its information exponentially. Here the prototype of life was the cause for the creation of the new information structure. Accidental errors in the duplication provided variations in replicative success. Most important, besides creating their information structures, biological systems are also
          <i>
           information processors
          </i>
          . Living things
          <i>
           use
          </i>
          information to guide their actions.
          <p>
          </p>
          With the appearance of life, agency and purpose appeared in the universe. Although some philosophers hold that life just gives us the "appearance of purpose."
          <p>
          </p>
          The third process of information creation, and the most important to philosophy, is human
          <a href="/freedom/creativity.html">
           creativity
          </a>
          . Almost every philosopher since philosophy began has considered the mind as something distinct from the body. Information philosophy can now explain that distinction. The mind can be considered the
          <i>
           immaterial
          </i>
          information in the brain. The brain, part of the material body, is a biological
          <i>
           information processor
          </i>
          . The stuff of mind is the information being processed and the new information being created.  As some philosophers have speculated,
          <br/>
          <i>
           mind is the software in the brain hardware
          </i>
          .
          <p>
          </p>
          Most material objects are
          <i>
           passive
          </i>
          information structures.
          <p>
          </p>
          Living things are information structures that
          <i>
           actively process
          </i>
          information. They communicate it between their parts to build, maintain, and repair their (material) information structure, through which matter and energy flow under the control of the information structure itself.
          <p>
          </p>
          Resisting the second law of thermodynamics locally, living things increase entropy globally much faster than non-living things. But most important, living things increase their information content as they develop. Humans learn from their experiences, storing knowledge in an
          <a href="/knowldge/ERR/">
           experience recorder and reproducer (ERR)
          </a>
          .
          <p>
          </p>
          Mental things (ideas) are pure abstractions from the material world, but they have control (downward causation) over the material and biological worlds. This enables
          <a href="freedom/agent-causality.html">
           agent causality
          </a>
          . Human minds create information structures, but their unique creation is the collection of abstract ideas that are the sum of human knowledge. It is these ideas that give humanity unparalleled extraordinary control over the material and biological worlds.
          <p>
          </p>
          It may come as a surprise for many thinkers to learn that the physics involved in the creation of all three types of information - material, biological, and mental - include the same two-step sequence of quantum physics and thermodynamics at the core of the
          <i>
           <a href="/introduction/creation/">
            cosmic creation process
           </a>

          .
          <p>
          </p>
          The most important information created in a mind is a recording of an individual's experiences (sensations). Recordings are played back (automatically and perhaps mostly unconsciously) as a guide to evaluate future actions (volitions) in similar situations. The particular past experiences reproduced are those stored in the brain located near elements of the current experience (association of ideas).
          <br/>
          Just as neurons that fire together wire together, neurons that have been wired together will later fire together.
          <p>
          </p>
          Sensations are recorded as the
          <i>
           mental effects of physical causes
          </i>
          .
          <br/>
          Sensations are stored as retrievable information in the mind of an individual self. Recordings include not only the five afferent senses but also the internal emotions - feelings of pleasure, pain, hopes, and fears - that accompany an experience. They constitute "what it's like" for a particular being to have an experience.
          <p>
          </p>
          Volitions are the
          <i>
           mental causes of physical effects
          </i>
          .
          <br/>
          Volitions begin with 1) the reproduction of past experiences that are similar to the current experience. These become
          <i>
           thoughts
          </i>
          about possible actions and the (partly random) generation of other alternative possibilities for action. They continue with 2) the evaluation of those freely generated thoughts followed by a willful selection (sometimes habitual) of one of those actions.
          <p>
          </p>
          Volitions are followed by 3) new sensations coming back to the mind indicating that the self has caused the action to happen (or not). This feedback is recorded as further retrievable information, reinforcing the
          <a href="/knowledge/">
           knowledge
          </a>
          stored in the mind that the individual self can cause this kind of action (or sometimes not).
          <p>
          </p>
          Many philosophers and most scientists have held that all knowledge is based on experience. Experience is ultimately the product of human sensations, and sensations are just electrical and chemical interactions with human skin and sense organs. But what of knowledge that is claimed to be mind-independent and independent of experience?

          Why is information better than logic and language for solving philosophical problems?
         </b>
         <blockquote>
          Broadly speaking, modern philosophy has been a search for
          <i>
           truth
          </i>
          , for
          <i>
           a priori
          </i>
          , analytic, certain, necessary, and provable truth.
          <p>
          </p>
          But all these concepts are mere ideas, invented by humans, some aspects of which have been discovered to be independent of the minds that invented them, notably formal logic and mathematics. Logic and mathematics are systems of thought, inside which the concept of demonstrable (apodeictic) truth is useful, but with limits set by
          <a href="/solutions/scientists/godel/">
           Kurt Gödel
          </a>
          's incompleteness theorem. The truths of logic and mathematics appear to exist "outside of space and time."
          <a href="/solutions/philosophers/leibniz/">
           Gottfried Leibniz
          </a>
          called then "true in all possible worlds," meaning their truth is independent of the physical world. We call them
          <i>
           a priori
          </i>
          because their proofs are independent of experience, although they were initially
          <a href="http://metaphysicist.com/problems/abstract_entities/">
           abstracted
          </a>
          from concrete human experiences.
          <p>
          </p>
          Analyticity is the idea that some statements, propositions in the form of sentences, can be
          <i>
           true
          </i>
          by the definitions or meanings of the words in the sentences. This is correct, though limited by verbal difficulties such as
          <a href="/solutions/philosophers/russell/">
           Russell

          's paradox and numerous other

           puzzles and paradoxes
          </a>
          . Analytic language philosophers claim to connect the words with objects, material things, and thereby tell us something about the world. Some modal logicians (cf.
          <a href="/solutions/philosophers/kripke/">
           Saul Kripke
          </a>
          ) claim that words that are
          <i>
           names
          </i>
          of things are necessary
          <i>

          , "true in all possible worlds." But this is nonsense, because we invented all those words and worlds. They are mere ideas.
          <p>

          Perhaps the deepest of all these philosophical ideas is
          <a href="/freedom/necessity.html">
           necessity
          </a>
          . Information philosophy can now tell us that there is no such thing as absolute necessity. There is of course an

           metaphysical

          , despite their invented "possible worlds," which are on inspection merely multiple "actual worlds." They are "
          <a href="/freedom/actualism.html">
           actualists

          <p>
          </p>
          Now chance, like truth, is just another idea, just some more
          <a href="/introduction/information/">
           information
          </a>
          . But what an idea! In a self-referential virtuous circle, it turns out that without the real possibilities that result from ontological chance, there can be no new information. Information philosophy offers cosmological and biological evidence for the
          <a href="/information/creation/">
           creation
          </a>
          of new information in the universe. So it follows that chance is real, fortunately something that we can keep under control. We are biological beings that have evolved, thanks to chance, from primitive single-cell communicating information structures to multi-cellular organisms whose defining aspect is the creation and communication of information.
          <p>
          </p>
          The theory of communication of information is the foundation of our "information age." To understand how we
          <i>

          things is to understand how knowledge
          <i>

          the material world of
          <i>
           embodied
          </i>
          "information structures" in the mental world of
          <i>
           immaterial

          ideas.
          <p>
          </p>
          All knowledge starts with the recording of
          <i>
           experiences
          </i>
          . The experiences of thinking, perceiving, knowing, believing, feeling, desiring, deciding, and acting may be bracketed by philosophers as "mental" phenomena, but they are no less real than other "physical" phenomena. They are themselves physical phenomena.
          <br/>
          They are just not
          <i>
           material things
          </i>
          .
          <p>

          Information philosophy defines human
          <a href="/knowledge/">
           knowledge
          </a>
          as
          <i>
           immaterial
          </i>
          information in a mind, or embodied in an external artifact that is an information structure (e.g., a book), part of the
          <a href="/knowledge/sum/">
           sum
          </a>
          of all human knowledge. Information in the mind about something in the external world is a proper subset of the information in the external object. It is
          <i>
           isomorphic
          </i>
          to a small part of the total information in or about the object. The information in living things, artifacts, and  especially machines, consists of much more than the material components and their arrangement (positions over time). It also consists of all the information processing (e.g., messaging) that goes on inside the thing as it realizes its entelechy or telos, its internal or external purpose.
          <p>
          </p>
          All science begins with information gathered from experimental observations, which are themselves mental phenomena. Observations are

          We shall see how information processes in the natural world use arbitrary symbols (e.g., nucleotide sequences) to

          , in which all information is lost, and given the best current model for the origin of the universe, which says everything began in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium some 13.75 billion years ago, how can it be that living beings are creating and communicating vast amounts of new information every day?

         None of these processes can work unless they have a way to get rid of the positive entropy (disorder) and leave behind a pocket of negative entropy (order or information). The positive entropy is either conducted, convected, or radiated away as waste matter and energy, as heat, or as pure radiation. At the quantum level, it is always the result of interactions between matter and radiation (photons). Whenever photons interact with material particles, the outcomes are inherently unpredictable. As
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/einstein/">
          Albert Einstein
         </a>
         discovered ten years before the founding of quantum mechanics, these interactions involve irreducible ontological

         .
         <p>
         </p>
         Negative entropy is an abstract thermodynamic concept that describes energy with the ability to do work, to make something happen. This kind of energy is often called free energy or available energy.
         <p>
         </p>
         In a maximally disordered state (called thermodynamic equilibrium) there can be matter in motion, the motion we call heat. But the average properties - density, pressure, temperature - are the same everywhere. Equilibrium is
         <i>
          formless
         </i>
         . Departures from equilibrium are when the physical situation shows differences from place to place. These differences are
         <i>
          information
         </i>
         .
         <p>
         </p>
         The second law of thermodynamics then simply means that isolated systems will eliminate differences from place to place until all properties are uniformly distributed. Natural processes spontaneously destroy information. Consider the classic case of what happens when we open a perfume bottle.

           The perfume molecules dissipate until they are uniformly distributed. Statistical physics mistakenly claims that if the velocities of all the particles were reversed at an instant, the molecules would return to the bottle. It assumes that the complete path information needed to return to the bottle is preserved. But
           <i>
            information is not conserved

         In the late nineteenth century,
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/boltzmann/">
          Ludwig Boltzmann
         </a>
         revolutionized thermodynamics with his kinetic theory of gases, based on the ancient assumption that matter is made up of collections of atoms. He derived a mathematical formula for entropy
         <i>
          S
         </i>
         as a function of the probabilities of finding a system in all the possible microstates of a system. When the actual macrostate is one with the largest number
         <i>
          W
         </i>
         of microstates, entropy is at a maximum, and no differences (information) are visible.
         <!-- The formula for negative entropy is just the <i>maximum possible entropy</i> minus the <i>actual entropy</i>.-->
         <p>
         </p>
         Boltzmann could not prove his "H-Theorem" about entropy increase.  His contemporaries challenged a "statistical" entropy increase on grounds of
         <a href="/problems/reversibility/">
          microscopic reversibility
         </a>
         and
         <a href="/problems/recurrence/">

         (both
         <a href="/quantum/problems/">

         </a>
         solved by information philosophy). He could not prove the existence of atoms.
         <p>
         </p>
         In the early twentieth century, Just before Boltzmann died,
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/einstein/">
          Albert Einstein
         </a>
         formulated a statistical mechanics that put Boltzmann's law of increasing entropy on a firmer mathematical basis. Einstein's work predicted the size of miniscule
         <i>
          fluctuations
         </i>
         around equilibrium, which Boltzmann had expected. Einstein showed that entropy does not, in fact, continually increase. It can decrease randomly in short bursts of local higher densities or organized motions. Though quickly extinguished, Einstein showed that the occasionally correlated motions of invisible atoms explains the visible "Brownian motion" of tiny particles like seed pollen.
         <p>
         </p>
         Einstein's calculations led to predictions that were confirmed quickly, proving the existence of discrete atoms that had been hypothesized for centuries. Sadly, Boltzmann may not have known of Einstein's proofs for his work.  Later Einstein saw the same fluctuation in radiation, proving his revolutionary
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/einstein/#light-quantum">
          hypothesis of light quanta
         </a>
         , now called photons. Although this is rarely appreciated, it was Einstein who showed that both matter and energy are discrete, discontinuous particles. His most famous equation shows they are convertible into one another,
         <i>
          E = mc
          <sup>
           2
          </sup>
         </i>
         . He also showed that the interaction of matter and radiation, of atoms and photons, always involves ontological
         <a href="/freedom/chance.html">
          chance
         </a>
         . This bothered Einstein greatly, because he thought his God should not "play dice."
         <p>
         </p>
         Late in life, Einstein said that if matter and energy cannot be described with the local continuous analytical functions in space and time needed for his field theories, that all his work would be "castles in the air." But the loss of classical
         <a href="/freedom/determinism.html">
          deterministic
         </a>
         ideas - which have ossified much of philosophy, crippling philosophical progress - is more than offset by the indeterministic of an open future and Einstein's belief in the "free creation of new ideas."
         <p>
         </p>
         In the middle twentieth century,
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/shannon/">
          Claude Shannon
         </a>
         derived the mathematical formula for the communication of
         <a href="/introduction/information/">
          information
         </a>
         .
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/neumann/">
          John von Neumann
         </a>
         found it to be identical to Boltzmann's formula for entropy, though with a minus sign (negative entropy). Where Boltzmann entropy is the number of possible microstates, Shannon entropy is the number of possible messages that can be communicated.
         <p>
         </p>
         Shannon found that new information cannot be created unless there are
         <a href="/freedom/possibilities.html">
          multiple possible messages
         </a>
         . This in turn depends on the ontological chance discovered by Einstein. In a deterministic universe, the total information at all times would be a constant. Information would be a conserved quantity, like matter and energy. "Nothing new under the Sun." But it is not constant, though many philosophers, mathematical physicists, and theologians (God's foreknowledge) still think so. Information is being
         <a href="/introduction/creation/">
          created constantly in our universe
         </a>
         . And we are co-creators of the information, including Einstein's "new ideas."
         <p>
         </p>
         Because "negative" entropy (order or information) is such a positive quantity, we chose in the 1970's to give it a new name - "
         <a href="/value/ergo/">
          Ergo
         </a>
         ," and to call the four phenomena or processes that create negative entropy "ergodic," for reasons that will become clear. But today, the positive name "information" is all that we need to do information philosophy.

         </div>
         How exactly has the universe escaped from the total disorder of thermodynamic equilibrium and produced a world full of information?
         <p>
         </p>
         It begins with the expansion of the universe. If the universe had not expanded, it would have remained in the original state of thermodynamic equilibrium. We would not be here.
         <p>
         </p>
         To visualize the departure from equilibrium that made us possible, remember that equilibrium is when particles are distributed evenly in all possible locations in space, and with their velocities distributed by a normal law - the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution. (The combination of position space and velocity or momentum space is called
         <i>
          phase space
         </i>
         ). When we open the perfume bottle, the molecules now have a much larger phase space to distribute into. There are a much larger number of phase space "cells" in which molecules could be located. It of course takes them time to spread out and come to a new equilibrium state (the Boltzmann "relaxation time.")
         <p>
          When the universe expands, say grows to ten times its volume, it is just like the perfume bottle opening. The matter particles must redistribute themselves to get back to equilibrium. But suppose the universe expansion rate is much faster than the equilibration or relaxation time. The universe is out of equilibrium, and in a flat, ever-expanding, universe it will never get back!
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         In the earliest moments of the universe, material particles were in equilibrium with radiation at extraordinarily high temperatures. When quarks formed neutrons and protons, they were short-lived, blasted back into quarks by photon collisions. As the universe expanded, the temperature cooled, the space per photon increased and the mean free time between photon collisions increased, giving larger particles a better chance to survive. The expansion red-shifted the photons. decreasing the average energy per photon, and eventually reducing the number of high energy photons that disassociate matter. The mean free path of photons was very short. They were being scattered by collisions with electrons.
         <p>
         </p>
         When temperature declined further, to  5000 degrees, about 400,000 years after the "Big Bang," the electrons and protons combined to make hydrogen and (with neutrons) helium atoms.
         <p>
         </p>
         <div style="float:right;margin:10px;width:350px">
          <img src="/images/Big_Bang_Timeline400.png"/>
         </div>
         At this time, a major event occurred that we can still see today, the farthest and earliest event visible. When the electrons combined into atoms, the electrons could no longer scatter the photons so easily. The universe became transparent for the photons. Some of those photons are still arriving at the earth today. They are now the red-shifted and cooled down cosmic microwave background radiation. While this radiation is almost perfectly uniform, it shows very small fluctuations that may be caused by random difference in the local density of the original radiation or even in random quantum fluctuations.
         <p>
         </p>
         These fluctuations mean that there were slight differences in density of the newly formed hydrogen gas clouds. The force of universal gravitation then worked to pull relatively formless matter into spherically symmetric stars and planets. Thus is the original
         <i>
          order out of chaos

         , although this phrase is now most associated with the work on deterministic chaos theory and complexity theory, as we shall see.

         , the

          Arrow of Time

         points not only to increasing disorder but also to increasing information.
         <p>
         </p>
         Two of our "ergodic" phenomena - gravity and quantum cooperative phenomena - pull matter together that was previously separated. Galaxies, stars, and planets form out of inchoate clouds of dust and gas. Gravity binds the matter together. Subatomic particles combine to form atoms. Atoms combine to form molecules. They are held together by quantum mechanics. In all these cases, a new visible information structure appears.
         <p>
         </p>
         In order for these structures to stay together, the motion (kinetic) energy of their parts must be radiated away. This is why the stars shine. When atoms join to become molecules, they give off photons. The new structure is now in a (negative) bound energy state. It is the radiation that carries away the positive entropy (disorder) needed to balance the new order (information) in the visible structure.
         <p>
         </p>
         In the cases of chaotic dissipative structures and life, the ergodic phenomena are more complex, but the result is similar, the emergence of visible information. (More commonly it is simply the
         <i>
          maintenance
         </i>
         of high-information, low-entropy structures.) These cases appear in far-from-equilibrium situations where there is a flow of matter and energy with negative entropy through the information structure. The flow comes in with low entropy but leaves with high entropy. Matter and energy are conserved in the flow, but information in the structure can increase (information is not a conserved quantity).
         <p>
         </p>
         Information is neither matter nor energy, though it uses matter when it is embodied and energy when it is communicated. Information is

         Both Bertalanffy and Schrödinger knew that the source of negative entropy was our Sun. Neither knew that the ultimate cosmological source of negative entropy is the expansion of the universe, which allowed ergodic gravitation forces to form the Sun. Note that the positive entropy radiation leaving the Sun becomes diluted as it expands, creating a difference between its energy temperature and energy density. This difference is information (negative entropy) that planet Earth uses to generate and maintain biological life.

         Note that the 300K (the average earth temperature) photons are dissipated into the dark night sky, on their way to the cosmic microwave background. The Sun-Earth-night sky is a heat engine, with a hot energy source and cold energy sink, that converts the temperature difference not into mechanical energy (work) but into biological energy (life).

          The Three Kinds of Information Emergence

            order out of chaos
           </i>
           when the randomly distributed matter in the early universe first gets organized into

            information structures
           </i>
           .
           <p>
           </p>
           This was not possible before the first atoms formed about 400,000 years after the Big Bang. Information structures like the stars and galaxies did not exist before about 400 million years. As we saw, gravitation was the principal driver creating information structures.
           <p>
           </p>
           Nobel prize winner
           <a href="/solutions/scientists/prigogine/">
            Ilya Prigogine
           </a>
           discovered another ergodic process that he described as the "self-organization" of "dissipative structures."  He popularized the slogan "order out of chaos" in an important book. Unfortunately, the "self" in self-organization led to some unrealizable hopes in cognitive psychology. There is no self, in the sense of a person or agent, in these physical phenomena.
           <p>
           </p>
           Both gravitation and Prigogine's dissipative systems produce a purely physical/material kind of order. The resulting structures
           <i>
            contain
           </i>
           information. There is a "steady state" flow of information-rich matter and energy through them. But they do not
           <i>
            process information
           </i>
           . They have no purpose, no "telos."
           <p>

           Order out of chaos can explain the

           <i>
            gross
           </i>
           kind of downward causal control. Explaining life and mind as "complex adaptive systems" has not been successful. We need to go beyond "chaos and complexity" theories to
           <i>
            teleonomic

           systems.

           In his famous essay, "What Is Life?,"
           <a href="/solutions/scientists/schrodinger/">
            Erwin Schrödinger
           </a>
           noted that life "feeds on negative entropy" (or information). He called this "order out of order."
           <p>
           </p>
           This kind of biological processing of information first emerged about 3.5 billion years ago on the earth. It continues today on multiple emergent biological levels, e.g., single-cells, multi-cellular systems, organs, etc., each level creating new information structures and information processing systems not
           <a href="/knowledge/reductionism.html">
            reducible
           </a>
           to (caused by) lower levels and exerting

           on the lower levels.
           <p>
           </p>
           And this downward causal control is extremely
           <i>
            fine

           , managing the motions and arrangements of individual atoms and molecules.
           <p>
           </p>
           Biological systems are cognitive systems, using internal "subjective" knowledge to recognize and interact with their "objective" external environment, communicating meaningful messages to their internal components and to other individuals of their species with a language of arbitrary symbols, taking actions to maintain themselves and to expand their populations by learning from experience.
           <p>
           </p>
           With the emergence of life, "purpose" also entered the universe. It is not the pre-existent "teleology" of many idealistic philosophies (the idea of "essence" before "existence"), but it is the "entelechy" of Aristotle, who saw that living things have within them a purpose, an end, a "telos." To distinguish this evolved telos in living systems from teleology, modern biologists use the term "teleonomy."

           when organisms with minds generate, store (in the brain), replicate, utilize, and then externalize some non-biological information, communicating it to other minds and storing it in the environment. Communication can be by hereditary genetic transmission or by an advanced organism capable of learning and then teaching its contemporaries directly by signaling, by speaking, or indirectly by writing and publishing the

           <p>
           </p>
           This kind of information can be highly abstract mind-stuff, pure Platonic ideas, the stock in trade of philosophers. It is neither matter nor energy (though embodied in the material brain), a kind of
           <i>
            pure spirit
           </i>
           or
           <i>
            ghost in the machine
           </i>
           . It is a candidate for the immaterial dualist "substance" of
           <a href="/solutions/philosophers/descartes/">
            René Descartes
           </a>
           , though it is probably better thought of as a "property dualism," since information is an
           <i>
            immaterial

           property of all matter.
           <p>
           </p>
           The information stored in the mind is not only abstract ideas. It contains a
           <i>
            recording
           </i>
           of the experiences of the individual. In principle every experience may be recorded, though not all may be reproducible/recallable.

         The negative entropy (order, or potential information) generated by the universe expansion is a tiny amount compared to the increase in positive entropy (disorder). Sadly, this is always the case when we try to get "order out of order," as can be seen by studying entropy flows at different levels of emergent phenomena.
         <p>
         </p>
         In any process, the positive entropy increase is always at least equal to, and generally orders of
magnitude larger than, the negative entropy in any created information structures, to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. The positive entropy is named for
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/boltzmann/">

         <a href="/solutions/scientists/shannon/">

         , since his theory of information communication has exactly the same mathematical formula as Boltzmann's famous principle;

when the falling temperature becomes low enough. These material particles are
attracted by the force of universal gravitation to form the gigantic

         Our solar radiation has a high color temperature (5000K) and
a low energy-content temperature (273K). It is out of equilibrium
and it is the source of all the information-generating negative
entropy that drives biological evolution on the Earth. Note that
the fraction of the light falling on Earth is less than a billionth of
that which passes by and is lost in space.

         A tiny fraction of the solar energy falling on the earth gets converted
into the information structures of plants and animals. Most
of it gets converted to heat and is radiated away as waste energy to
the night sky.

         Every biological structure is a quantum mechanical structure.
Quantum cooperative phenomena allow DNA to maintain its stable information structure over billions
of years in the constant presence of chaos and noise. And biological structures contain astronomical numbers of particles, allowing them to average over the random noise of individual quantum events, becoming "adequately determined."

          The Shannon Principle - No Information Without Possibilities
         </div>
         In his development of the mathematical theory of the communication of information,
         <a href="/solutions/scientists/shannon/">
          Claude Shannon
         </a>
         showed that there can be no new
         <a href="/introduction/information/">
          information
         </a>
         in a message unless there are multiple possible messages. If only one message is
         <a href="/freedom/possibilities.html">
          possible
         </a>
         , there is no information in that message.
         <p>
         </p>
         We can simplify this to define the Shannon Principle.
         <i>
          No new information can be
          <a href="/introduction/creation/">
           created
          </a>
          in the universe unless there are multiple possibilities
         </i>
         , only one of which can become actual.
         <p>
         </p>
         An alternative statement of the Shannon principle is that in a
         <a href="/freedom/determinism.html">
          deterministic
         </a>
         system, information is conserved, unchanging with time. Classical mechanics is a
         <i>
          conservative
         </i>
         system that conserves not only energy and momentum but also conserves the total information. Information is a "constant of the motion" in a determinist world.
         <p>
         </p>
         Quantum mechanics, by contrast, is
         <a href="/freedom/indeterminism.html">
          indeterministic
         </a>
         . It involves irreducible ontological

         An

         quantum system is described by a wave function ψ which evolves - deterministically - according to the unitary time evolution of the linear

         outcomes are indeterministic.
         <p>
         </p>
         This sounds a bit contradictory, but it is not. It is the essence of the highly non-intuitive quantum theory, which combines a deterministic "wave" aspect with an indeterministic "particle" aspect.

           This is as close as we get to a description of the motion of the "particle" aspect of a quantum system. According to von Neumann, the particle simply shows up somewhere as a result of a measurement.

           says that the particle shows up whenever a new stable information structure is created, information that can be observed.

         Quantum mechanics introduces real
         <i>
          possibilities
         </i>
         , each with a calculable
         <i>
          probability
         </i>
         of becoming an
         <i>
          actuality
         </i>
         , as a consequence of one quantum system interacting (for example colliding) with another quantum system.
         <p>
         </p>
         It is quantum interactions that lead to new information in the universe - both new information structures and information processing systems. But that
         <i>
          new information cannot subsist
         </i>
         unless a compensating amount of
         <i>
          entropy is transferred away
         </i>
         from the new information.
         <p>
         </p>
         Even more important, it is only in cases where information persists long enough for a human being to observe it that we can properly describe the observation as a "
         <a href="/problems/measurement/">
          measurement
         </a>
         " and the human being as an "observer." So, following von Neumann's "process" terminology, we can complete his admittedly unsuccessful attempt at a theory of the measuring process by adding an anthropomorphic
         <blockquote>
          <b>
           Process 3
          </b>
          - a conscious observer
          <i>
           recording
          </i>
          new
          <i>
           information
          </i>
          in a mind. This is only possible if the local reductions in the entropy (the first in the measurement apparatus, the second in the mind) are both balanced by even greater increases in positive entropy that must be transported away from the apparatus and the mind, so the overall change in entropy can satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.

         Biological systems are different from purely physical systems primarily because they create, store, and communicate information. Living things store information in a memory of the past that they use to shape their future. Fundamental physical objects like atoms have no history.

         Since the 1950's, the science of human behavior has changed dramatically from a "black box" model of a mind that started out as a "blank slate" conditioned by environmental stimuli. Today's mind model contains many "functions" implemented with stored programs, all of them information structures in the brain. The new "computational model" of cognitive science likens the brain to a computer, with some programs and data inherited and others developed as appropriate reactions to experience.

          The Experience Recorder and Reproducer
         </div>
         The brain should be regarded less as an algorithmic computer, with one or more central processing units addressing multiple data storage systems, than as a multi-channel and multi-track
         <a href="/problems/mind_body/#ERR">
          experience recorder and reproducer
         </a>
         with an extremely high data rate. Information about an experience - the sights, sounds, smells, touch, and taste - is recorded along with the emotions - feelings of pleasure, pain, hopes, and fears - that accompany the experience. When confronted with similar experiences later, the brain can reproduce information about the original experience (an instant replay) that helps to guide current actions.
         <p>
         </p>
         The ERR model stands in contrast to the popular cognitive science or “computational” model of a mind as a digital computer. No algorithms, data addressing schemes, or stored programs are needed for the ERR model.
         <p>
         </p>
         The physical metaphor is a non-linear random-access data recorder, where data is stored using
         <i>
          content-addressable memory
         </i>
         (the memory address is the data content itself). Simpler than a computer with stored algorithms, a better technological metaphor might be a video and sound recorder, enhanced with the ability to record - and replay - smells, tastes, touches, and critically essential, feelings.
         <p>
         </p>
         The biological model is neurons that wire together during an organism’s experiences, in multiple sensory and limbic systems, such that later firing of even a part of the wired neurons can stimulate firing of all or part of the original complex.
         <p>
         </p>
         A conscious being is constantly recording information about its
perceptions of the external world, and most importantly for ERR,
it is simultaneously recording its feelings. Sensory data such as
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations are recorded in
a sequence along with pleasure and pain states, fear and comfort
levels, etc.
         <p>
         </p>
         All these experiential and emotional data are recorded in
association with one another. This means that when the experiences
are reproduced (played back in a temporal sequence), the
accompanying emotions are once again felt, in synchronization.
         <p>
         </p>
         The ability to reproduce an experience is critical to learning
from past experiences, so as to make them guides for action in
future experiences. The ERR model is the minimal mind model
that provides for such learning by living organisms.
         <p>
         </p>
         The ERR model does not need computer-like decision algorithms
to reproduce past experiences. All that is required is that
past experiences “play back” whenever they are stimulated by
present experiences that resemble the past experiences in one or
more ways.
         <p>
         </p>
         Where neuroscientists have shown "neurons that fire together wire together," the ERR model of information philosophy simply is "
         <i>
          neurons that have been wired together will fire together
         </i>
         ."
         <p>
         </p>
         Neuroscientists and philosophers of mind have long asked how diverse signals from multiple locations in the brain over multiple pathways appear so unified in the brain. The ERR model offers a simple solution to this “binding” problem. Experiences are bound at their initial recording. They do not have to be re-associated by some central processing unit looking up where experiences may have been distributed among the various sensory or memory areas.
         <p>
         </p>
         The ERR model may also throw some light on the problem of "qualia" and of "what it's like to be" a particular organism.

          <a href="/solutions/scientists/eddington/">
           Arthur Stanley Eddington
          </a>
          . In his 1928
          <i>
           Nature of the Physical World
          </i>
          , Eddington argued that quantum indeterminacy had "opened the door of human freedom," and that the second law of thermodynamics might have some bearing on the question of objective good.

          In the 1950's, we studied the then leading philosophies of positivism and existentialism.

           Ludwig Wittgenstein
          </a>
          , proposed logic and language as the proper foundational basis, not only of philosophy, but also of mathematics and science. Wittgenstein's
          <i>
           Tractatus
          </i>
          imagined that a set of all true propositions could capture all the knowledge of modern science.

          </p>
          On the continent, existentialism was the rage. We read
          <a href="/solutions/philosophers/nietzsche/">
           Friedrich Nietzsche
          </a>
          ,

           Martin Heidegger

          , and
          <a href="/solutions/philosophers/sartre/">
           Jean-Paul Sartre
          </a>
          .
          <p>
          </p>
          The existentialist continentals argued that freedom exists, but there are no objective values. The utilitarian English argued that values exist, but human
          <a href="/freedom/">
           freedom
          </a>
          does not.
          <p>
          </p>
          We wrote that "
          <i>
           Values without freedom are useless. Freedom without values is absurd.
          </i>
          "
          <p>
          </p>
          This was a
          <i>
           chiasmos
          </i>
          like the great figure of

           Immanuel Kant

           Charles Sanders Peirce

          as "Idealism without Materialism is Empty. Materialism without Idealism is Blind."
          <p>
          </p>
          In the 1960's, we formulated arguments that cited "pockets of low entropy," in
          <i>
           apparent violation
          </i>
          of the second law, as the possible basis for anything with objective
          <a href="/value/">
           value
          </a>
          .  We puzzled over the origin of "negative entropy," since the universe was believed to have started in thermodynamic equilibrium and the second law of thermodynamics says that (positive) entropy can only increase.
          <p>
          </p>
          In the late 1960's, we developed a
          <a href="/freedom/cogito/">
           two-stage model
          </a>
          of free will and called it
          <a href="/freedom/cogito/">
           Cogito
          </a>
          , a term often associated with the mind and with thought.
With deference to Descartes, the first modern philosopher, we called "negative entropy"
          <a href="/value/ergo/">
           Ergo
          </a>
          . While thermodynamics calls it "negative," information philosophy sees it as the ultimate "positive" and deserving of a better name. We thought that Ergo etymologically suggests a fundamental kind of energy ("erg" zero), e.g., the "Gibbs free energy," G
          <sub>
           0
          </sub>
          , that is available to do work because it has low entropy.
          <p>
          </p>
          In the early 70's, we decided to call the sum of human
          <a href="/knowledge/">
           knowledge
          </a>
          the
          <a href="/knowledge/sum/">
           Sum
          </a>
          , to complete the triple wordplay on Descartes' proof of his existence.
          <p>
          </p>
          We saw a great battle going on in the universe - between originary chaos and emergent cosmos. The struggle is between destructive chaotic processes that drive a microscopic underworld of random events
          <em>
           versus
          </em>
          constructive cosmic processes that create information structures with extraordinary
          <a href="/knowledge/emergence.html">
           emergent
          </a>
          properties that include
          <a href="freedom/adequate_determinism.html">
           adequately determined
          </a>
          scientific laws - 
despite, and in many cases making use of, the microscopic chaos.
          <p>
          </p>
          Since the destructive chaos is
          <i>
           entropic
          </i>
          , we repurposed a term from statistical mechanics and called the anti-entropic processes creating information structures
          <i>
           ergodic
          </i>
          . The  embedded
          <a href="/value/ergod/">
           Ergod
          </a>
          resonated.
          <p>
          </p>
          Created information structures range from galaxies, stars, and planets, to molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles. They are the structures of terrestrial life from viruses and bacteria to sentient and intelligent beings. And they are the constructed ideal world of thought, of intellect, of spirit, including the laws of nature, in which we humans play a role as co-creator.
          <p>
          </p>
          Information is constant in a
          <a href="/freedom/determinism.html">
           deterministic
          </a>
          universe. There is "nothing new under the sun." The
          <a href="/introduction/creation/">
           creation of new information
          </a>
          is not possible without the
          <a href="/freedom/chance.html">
           random chance
          </a>
          and
          <a href="/freedom/uncertainty.html">
           uncertainty
          </a>
          of quantum mechanics, plus the extraordinary temporal stability of quantum mechanical structures.
          <p>
          </p>
          It is of the deepest philosophical significance that information is based on the mathematics of
          <a href="/freedom/probability.html">
           probability
          </a>
          . If all outcomes were
          <a href="/freedom/certainty.html">
           certain
          </a>
          , there would be no "surprises" in the universe. Information would be conserved and a universal constant, as some mathematicians mistakenly believe. Information philosophy requires the ontological uncertainty and probabilistic outcomes of modern quantum physics to produce new information.
          <p>
          </p>
          But at the same time, without the extraordinary
          <i>
           stability
          </i>
          of quantized information structures over cosmological time scales, life and the universe we know would not be possible. That stability is the consequence of an underlying digital nature.  Quantum mechanics reveals the architecture of the universe to be
          <i>
           discrete
          </i>
          rather than
          <i>
           continuous
          </i>
          , to be
          <i>
           digital
          </i>
          rather than
          <i>
           analog
          </i>
          . Digital information transfers are essentially perfect. All analog transfers are "lossy."
          <p>
          </p>
          Moreover, the "correspondence principle" of quantum mechanics and the "law of large numbers" of statistics ensures that macroscopic objects can normally average out microscopic uncertainties and probabilities to provide the "
          <a href="/freedom/adequate_determinism.html">
           adequate determinism
          </a>
          " that shows up in all our "Laws of Nature."
          <p>
          </p>
          Information philosophy explores some classical problems in philosophy with deeper and more fundamental insights than is possible with the logic and language approach of modern analytic philosophy.

          <em>

          Finally, a new philosophy of biology should be based on the deep understanding of organisms as information users, information creators, information communicators, and at the higher levels, information processors, including humans who have learned to store information externally and transfer it between the generations culturally. Except for organisms that can extract information by photosynthesis of the negative entropy (free or available energy) streaming from the sun, most living things destroy other cells to extract the information needed to maintain their own low entropy state of organization. Most life feeds on other life.
          <p>
          </p>
          And most life communicates with other life. Even single cells, before the emergence of multicellular organisms, developed communication systems between the cells that are still visible in slime molds and social amoebae today. In a multicellular organism, every cell has some level of communication with all the others. Most higher level organisms share communal information that makes them stronger as a social group than as independent individuals. The
          <a href="/value/sum/">
           sum

          of human knowledge has amplified the power of humanity, for better or worse, to a level that can control the environmental conditions on all of planet Earth.

          is the hypothesis that all biological evolution should be viewed primarily as the development of more and more powerful users, creators, and communicators of information. Seen though the lens of information, humans are the current end product of information
          <i>

The purpose of human populations then is to use, to add to, and to communicate human knowledge in order to maximize the human capital per person.
          <p>
          </p>
          Like love, the information that is shared by educating others is not used up. Information is not a scarce economic good. The more that information is communicated, the more of it there is, in human minds (not brains), and in the external stores of human

            Briefly, we find positive value (or good) in
            <a href="/introduction/information/">
             information
            </a>
            structures. We see negative value (or evil) in disorder and entropy tearing down such structures. We call energy with low entropy "

             Ergo
            </a>
            " and call anti-entropic processes "ergodic." We recognize that "ergodic" is itself too esoteric and thus not likely to be widely accepted. Perhaps the most positive term for what we value is just "information" itself!
            <blockquote>
             Our first categorical imperative is then "act in such a way as to create, maintain, and preserve information as much as possible against destructive entropic processes."
             <p>
             </p>
             Our second ethical imperative is "share knowledge/information to the maximum extent." Like love, our own information is not diminished when we share it with others
             <p>
             </p>
             Our third moral imperative is "educate (share the knowledge of what is right) rather than punish." Knowledge is virtue. Punishment wastes human capital and provokes revenge.

         All three ideas depend on understanding modern cosmology, physics, biology, and neuroscience, but especially the intimate connection between quantum mechanics and the second law of thermodynamics that allows for the creation of new information structures.
         <p>
         </p>
         All three are based on the theory of information, which alone can establish the existential status of
         <em>
          ideas

         , not just the ideas of knowledge, value, and freedom, but other-worldly speculations in natural religion like God and immortality.
         <p>
         </p>
         All three have been anticipated by earlier thinkers, but can now be defended on strong empirical grounds. Our goal is less to innovate than to reach the best possible consensus among philosophers living and dead, an intersubjective agreement between philosophers that is the surest sign of a knowledge advance.

         Philosophy is the love of knowledge or wisdom. Information philosophy (
         <em>
          I-Phi
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          ΙΦ
         </em>
         ) qualifies and quantifies knowledge as meaningful actionable information. Information philosophy reifies information as an immaterial entity that has causal power over the material world!

          <em>
           information
          </em>
         </a>
         that merits its use as the foundation of a new method of inquiry?
         <p>
         </p>
         Abstract information is neither matter nor energy, yet it needs matter for its concrete embodiment and energy for its communication. Information is the modern
         <em>
          spirit
         </em>
         , the
         <em>
          ghost in the machine
         </em>
         . It is the stuff of thought, the
         <i>
          immaterial
         </i>
         substance of philosophy.
         <p>
         </p>
         Information is a powerful diagnostic tool. It is a better abstract basis for philosophy, and for science as well, especially physics, biology, and neuroscience. It is capable of answering questions about
         <a href="/problems/metaphysics/">
          metaphysics
         </a>
         (the ontology of things themselves),
         <a href="/knowledge/">
          epistemology
         </a>
         (the existential status of ideas and how we know them), and idealism itself.
         <p>
         </p>
         Information philosophy is now more than the solution to three fundamental problems we identified in the 1960's and '70's.  I-Phi is a
         <i>
          new philosophical method
         </i>
         , capable of solving
         <a href="/problems/">
          multiple problems in both philosophy and physics
         </a>
         . It needs young practitioners, presently tackling some problem, who might investigate the problem using this new methodology.
         <p>
         </p>
         Note that, just as the philosophy of language is not linguistic philosophy, Information philosophy is not the philosophy
         <i>
          of
         </i>
         information, which is mostly about computers and cognitive science, the computational theory of mind.
         <p>
         </p>
         Philosophers like
         <a href="/solutions/philosophers/wittgenstein/">
          Ludwig Wittgenstein
         </a>
         labeled many of our problems “philosophical puzzles.”
         <a href="/solutions/philosophers/russell/">
          Bertrand Russell
         </a>
         called them “pseudo-problems.” Analytic language philosophers thought many of these problems could be “dis-solved,” revealing them to be conceptual errors caused by the misuse of language.
         <p>
         </p>
         Information philosophy takes us past logical puzzles and language games, not by diminishing philosophy and replacing it with science.
         <p>
         </p>
         Russell insisted that
         <blockquote>
          “questions which are already capable of definite answers are placed in the sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer can be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy.”
          <blockquote>
           <div class="breadcrumbs">
            (
            <i>
             The Problems of Philosophy

           </div>
          </blockquote>
         </blockquote>
         Information philosophy aims to show that problems in philosophy should not be reduced to “Russell’s Residue.”
         <p>
         </p>
         The language philosophers of the twentieth century thought that they could solve (or at least
         <i>
          dis-solve
         </i>
         ) the classical problems of philosophy. They did not succeed. Information philosophy, by comparison, now has cast a great deal of light on
         <a href="/problems/">
          some of those problems
         </a>
         . It needs more information philosophers to join us to make more progress.

         </p>
         To recap, when information is stored in any structure, two fundamental physical processes occur. First is a "collapse" of a quantum mechanical wave function, reducing multiple possibilities to a single actuality. Second is a local decrease in the entropy corresponding to the increase in information. Entropy greater than that must be transferred away from the new information structure to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.
         <p>
         </p>
         These quantum level processes are susceptible to
         <a href="/freedom/noise.html">
          noise
         </a>
         . Information stored may have errors. When information is retrieved, it is again susceptible to noise. This may garble the information content. In information science, noise is generally the enemy of information. But some noise is the friend of freedom, since it is the source of novelty, of
         <a href="/freedom/creativity.html">
          creativity
         </a>
         and invention, and of variation in the biological gene pool.
         <p>
         </p>
         Biological systems have maintained and increased their invariant information content over billions of generations, coming as close to immortality as living things can. Philosophers and scientists have increased our knowledge of the external world, despite logical, mathematical, and physical uncertainty. They have created and
         <i>
          externalized
         </i>
         information (
         <a href="/knowledge/">
          knowledge
         </a>
         ) that can in principle become
         <a href="/problems/immortality/">
          immortal
         </a>
         . Both life and mind create information in the face of noise. Both do it with sophisticated error detection and correction schemes.  The scheme we use to correct human knowledge is
         <em>
          science
         </em>
         , a two-stage combination of
         <a href="/freedom/">
          freely invented

         theories and
         <a href="/freedom/adequate_determinism.html">

          A web page may contain two extra levels of material. The Normal page is material for newcomers and students of the Information Philosophy. Two hidden levels contain material for teachers (e.g., secondary sources) and for scholars (e.g., footnotes, and original language quotations).
         </div>
         Teacher materials on a page will typically include references to secondary sources and more extended explanations of the concepts and arguments. Secondary sources will include books, articles, and online resources. Extended explanations should be more suitable for teaching others about the core philosophical ideas, as seen from an information perspective.

         Scholarly materials will generally include more primary sources, more in-depth technical and scientific discussions where appropriate, original language versions of quotations, and references to all sources.

         Footnotes for a page appear in the Scholar materials. The footnote indicators themselves are only visible in Scholar mode.
