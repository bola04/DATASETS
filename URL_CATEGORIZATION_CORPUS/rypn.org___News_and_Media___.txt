           It's been nearly 6 years since the last article/brief was published. Since then Railway Preservation News has essentially been running on autopilot.  It's high time that we fix this.
          </p>
          <p>
           Looking over the articles &amp; briefs it appears that we are missing a large number of images.  Between August 2006 and April 2007 the previous owner of the website had run out of space on rypn.org and had started hosting images on a third-party domain.  A few years after that the third-party domain was transferred to new ownership and the images hosted on it for RyPN were lost.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have searched though the files we inherited and scoured the archives of the web attempting to find these missing images.  Unfortunately we have come up empty handed.  In the hope of a miracle we are asking all visitors to this website to check and see if they might have saved any of those images over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you have any of those files on hand and would like to help restore these articles please send any and all pictures to
           <a href="mailto:articles@rypn.org">
            articles@rypn.org
           </a>
           and we will work to restore those images to their respective articles.  Alternatively the images cannot be found then in time we will be forced to remove many of those articles as the photos played a crucial role in many of those articles.

                      <p>Each chapter seems to have been written apart from every other one, and they all spend a lot of ink covering the same ground about how important the logging industry was to the area, how the railroad opened it up, and where the tracks ran. The chapters are titled geographically, based on the town along the line, and the book's authorship is credited to a society rather than to any individual, so it might have been written by a committee of separate people copying each other unintentionally.</p>

            	      	<p class="preamble">This focused and intensive book chronicles the technological and operating history of the Pacific Electric Railway's 500 class cars from inception through retirement and rebirth through replication.</p>
                      <p>Smatlak places the evolution of the cars within the framework of the changes undergone by the Pacific Electric system and the greater Los Angeles region as an organic part of the whole. Thus the book, while full of technical details about the cars, their equipment, and mode of use, also provides the contextual basis for understanding the wider and richer history of the railway system. It is profusely illustrated with historic photographs to build on the context, as well as illustrate the technical evolution of the cars. Along with the historic photos of the cars in use, drawings, shop documents, even the original bills of sale for the cars makes this one of the most complete histories of a single class of rolling stock I've had the pleasure of reviewing.</p>

The historian knows his history, there are many images covering a lot of ground to choose from, and the company lasted from the early days of the trolley era right into the recent preservation era, making a lot of interesting changes along the way.</p>
            		<p>Philadelphia Railroads is different - its structure is as much about the context and infrastructure and economic railroading history of Philadelphia as the rolling stock, of not moreso. One of the authors is an architectural historian, and the content is richer for it. Of course, it would be difficult to find a more fertile ground for railroad related history taken broadly in the US than Philadelphia.</p>

Like Volume 1, it is self published and bound with a plastic comb between clear acetate covers. 203 pages, with many illustrations, diagrams, tables, etc. Building on college level computer programming in engineeering stress analysis in the late '70's - early '80's, Doug has developed a program by which structural analysis of railway bridges can be calculated. A CD is included in the back cover, which will aid in computing the stresses in bridges or other large structures.</p>      	<p>Doug organized his book progressively, such that terms and concepts are presented, then joined in application, which helps in comprehension a great deal. Once structural analysis topics such as stresses , reactions and failure modes are covered, examples of calculations from structures Doug built or engineered tie it all together in very practical ways.</p>      	<ul class="meta"> 		            <li class="extended"><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=090915211158.txt" title="">Continue reading...</a></li>			            <li class="date">September 15th, 2009</li>				            <li class="authorinfo">Dave Lathrop</li>		        </ul>      </div>                <div class="entry">      	<h3><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=090906161056.txt" title="Book Review: Scranton Railroads ">Book Review: Scranton Railroads </a></h3>      	<p class="preamble">This is a recent installment from Arcadia Publishing in their IMAGES series of compilations of chapters of captioned images following short historic monographs.

At 9:15 pm that evening, 103 touched down on the rails of the Naugatuck Railroad in Waterville, Connecticut. The "Naugy" is the operating heritage railroad of the Railroad Museum of New England.</p>	<p>103 was built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in November 1925, for the Sumter & Choctaw Railroad, a small logging railway in northern Alabama. It has a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement. The engine worked there for over 30 years, and was sold in 1962 to the Empire State Railway Museum of Middletown, NY. 103 operated at Middletown until late 1966, and was moved to the new Valley Railroad at Essex in early 1971.</p>	<ul class="meta"> 		<li class="extended"><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=090626211118.txt" title="">Continue reading...</a></li>		<li class="date">July 6th, 2009</li>		<li class="authorinfo">Howard Pincus</li>	</ul></div><div class="entry"><h3><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=090420190358.txt" title="Book Review: Pelican Road">Book Review: Pelican Road</a></h3>  	<p class="preamble">We seldom see any fiction based in the world of historic railroading, and what little does get published is usually fraught with inaccuracies that spoil it for those of us with some understanding of the subject.</p>	<p>Howard Bahr has provided us with a book that takes place in a world we can understand without such problems, and with a richness and depth of color that brings us into his world.

In July, 1951, the Kansas (locally known as the Kaw) River crested nearly 15 feet above flood stage, causing nearly one billion dollars damage in 1951 figures in the Kansas/Missouri region. The area's railroads were devastated, with the worst damage at Topeka, where both the Santa Fe and Rock Island railroad bridges were lost.</p>	<p>Two Mikados and one 2-6-2 were lost, the Prairie type and one 2-8-2 sinking close by. The other Mikado was apparently swept further downstream and was never located.

This began during the spring and summer of 2004, roughly 16 years after its arrival, by TVRM member Robert Frye.</p>	<p>When the locomotive arrived in 1988, it had seen nearly 35 years of service, and taken on its share of wear and tear. Most certainly during its service life, it has undergone numerous running repairs and overhauls, but one thing it suffered badly from now was wiring fatigue. We cannot be sure how much, if any, of the wiring was ever replaced, but these problems were very evident in the electrical cabinets.</p>	<ul class="meta"> 		<li class="extended"><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=090202182645.txt" title="">Continue reading...</a></li>		<li class="date">February 2nd, 2009</li>		<li class="authorinfo">Mike Overlander</li>	</ul></div>  <div class="entry"><h3><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=090125220850.txt" title="Endangered: France's most beautiful railroad!">Endangered: France's most beautiful railroad!</a></h3>  	<p class="preamble">What started in 1870 as a means of transporting coal northwards from Alps in the Cevennes to Paris, has become a vital life-line for the peoples who still populate France's most remote mountain region. Yet a country that is rightly envied worldwide for the quality of its public services, is in danger of wielding the axe that would not only destroy a national railroading gem, along with the livelihoods of all those dependent on it, but also explode any pretensions France might have towards a commitment to sustainable development.</p>	<p>The Cevennes railway, or 'Le C&eacute;venol' as it is affectionately known, is located in south-central France. It links Nimes to Clermont Ferrand, a distance of around two hundred miles, in five hours. The railroad is a cross country, non-TGV route, and forms part of the longer Paris to Marseille line along which trains run daily to the Mediterranean port. It took between six and seven thousand men a total of six years to build, at a cost of 520 million francs (120 million USD). That sum is almost impossible to equate to modern-day values, but was considered staggering by commentators of the day.</p>	<ul class="meta"> 		<li class="extended"><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=090125220850.txt" title="">Continue reading...</a></li>		<li class="date">January 25th, 2009</li>		<li class="authorinfo">Scott Anderson</li>	</ul></div>   <div class="entry"><h3><a href="/briefs/single.php?filename=080901121400.txt" title="The Anatomy of a Locomotive Restoration:  An Introduction">The Anatomy of a Locomotive Restoration:  An Introduction</a></h3>  	<p class="preamble">Like all stories, this one should start at the beginning.
