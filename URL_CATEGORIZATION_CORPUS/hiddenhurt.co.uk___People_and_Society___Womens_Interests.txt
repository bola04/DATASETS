            to make sense of what happened; you may know someone who is being 
            abused and want to understand what they are going through; or you 
            may be worried that you are abusive towards the person you love.

        Throughout 
            most of this site I have referred to the victim of abuse as female, 
            the abuser as male. This is to simplify the grammar (ie avoiding 'she/he', 
            since we don't have a common word for both) and make the information 
            more readable, though I realise that there are many men who are either 
            current victims of domestic abuse or have survived and escaped an 
            abusive relationship.

         AGENCY AND SUPPORT SERVICES QUESTIONNAIRE

       <p>
        Four agencies have commissioned A Two Part National Consultation on Stalking 
  to seek views of Statutory Agencies &amp; support services about current service 
  provision, to raise public awareness and understanding of Stalking.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         There are two questionnaires:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        1. Agency and Support Services questionnaire which is being sent out direct 
  via email. Any organisation can request to receive a copy of this via our website
        <a href="www.scaredofsomeone.org" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">
         www.scaredofsomeone.org
        </a>
        or by email:

         stalkinguk@yahoo.com
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        2. Public questionnaire which can be completed online on our website www.scaredofsomeone.org
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         We would like to ask just two things of you:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        1. That you would send this questionnaire to all your staff and ask them to 
  complete it and return it to us at email:
        <a href="stalkinguk@yahoo.com%20">
         stalkinguk@yahoo.com
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        2. That you would ask all your service users to visit
        <a href="www.scaredofsomeone.org" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">
         www.scaredofsomeone.org
        </a>
        and complete as many questions on the public questionnaire as they feel able 
  to or relevant.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Statutory Agency and Support Services Questions:
       </h4>
       <p>
        Not all questions will be relevant to all agencies. Please choose the ones 
  that are relevant to your agency or service. We understand how busy you are 
  and have made the 17 questions as quick and easy to complete as we can. If your 
  answer is YES, just delete the NO, and vice versa.
       </p>

        The long-awaited book from our very own Steve from the Hidden Hurt Message

        <strong>
         THE JERK RADAR
        </strong>
       </h2>
       <p>
        Have you ever gone out with someone who seemed perfect at first, but ended 
    up being a nightmare? Do you find yourself falling in love but ending up feeling 
    disrespected and used? Would you like to make sure that something like that 
    never happens to you (or someone you care about) again? If so, this book is 
    written for you. There are lots of books about how to tell if you're in an 
    abusive relationship. This is book will keep you from getting into one in 
    the first place. Jerk Radar will help you see how a Jerk takes advantage of 
    common cultural expectations and romantic myths to blind you to his true intentions. 
    It will give you concrete ways to test out his intentions in the course of 
    a normal conversation. And the Jerk Radar Quiz provides an effective tool 
    to screen every partner for Jerky tendencies well before obviously selfish 
    behavior emerges. Full of true stories from abuse survivors, Jerk Radar pulls 
    no punches in exposing what Jerks do and why we fall for it. This is a useful, 
    down-to-earth, practical guide to avoiding a bad relationship instead of recovering 
    from one. Read it today - it just may change your life!
