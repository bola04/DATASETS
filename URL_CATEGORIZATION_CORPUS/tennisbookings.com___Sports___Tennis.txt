        "I just wanted to thank you for helping transform the way we reserve our courts here at the Walton Life
                        Fitness Center [Walmart HQ].
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As a corporate fitness facility with twenty courts ranging from tennis to squash to wallyball, we have
                        used tennisbookings.com to help us manage the 500 plus court bookings we have per week and our members couldn’t be
                        happier with the system.  We use the site to enforce specific rules to our club and now the courts are booked
                        fairly with greater utilization and equal access to all.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As a manager, I like having the court reservations being booked by our members rather than the staff
                        as it helps us avoid he said/she said situations (member says they booked a court at one time and we have it
                        written down at a different time).  I appreciate being able to “audit” a reservation to see who booked it and at
                        what time.  Our members love the ability to see what courts are available 24 hours a day rather than having to
                        call during open hours and book over the phone.  The statistics we can generate (how many ball machine hours,
                        lesson hours, team tennis hours, etc.) is also a very useful tool.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Support has been very prompt and helpful in accommodating all of our special programming requests
                        including meeting the security requirements that we required to keep our members’ information safe.  The
                        overwhelming positive feedback we have gotten from our members after just three months of using this online
                        scheduler, reinforces what a great decision it was to switch from our paper reservation system to
                        tennisbookings.com.  "

        "We are a small private tennis club that relied on a phone answering system for our court bookings. We paid
                        the booking agency for court reservations, cancellations and inquiries. Faced with increasing costs we began
                        looking at a more accessible and cost effective booking solution. We looked at several systems but
                        ‘Tennisbookings.com’ was by far the best solution for us. Our members love the ability to view court bookings
                        online, making and cancelling bookings is a ‘cinch' and that came from our older members too!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The level of technical support provided during the integration into our web site was superb. The system

        "I highly recommend the tennis booking system for any club or public facility.  It has streamlined my
                        reservations and increased revenues.  My members and instructors love it too! The ability to see court
                        availability and to reserve courts by smart phone, ipad or computer is an easy sale these days.
                        We also love the new membership sign up feature.  Since we began our memberships have continuously grown to the
                        point we may have to limit them.
                        I only regret not getting started with tennis bookings 10 years earlier.

        "The YMCA started using tennisbookings.com in 2010 to manage our tennis court reservations, and immediately
                        received rave reviews from the staff and members alike.  It has made the entire court booking process more
                        efficient for everyone.  It has increased accuracy and eliminated early morning calls to the front desk, calls to
                        check on court availability and scheduling mix-ups caused by the old paper ledger system.  We have
                        now expanded its use to include signups for events like socials, practices and USTA matches.  A bonus has
                        been the ability to import the Y’s membership database on a weekly basis to more easily track player’s membership
                        and account status.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I would highly recommend this program to any facilities looking to manage their tennis court

        "As a small, seasonal tennis club we were looking for a simple system to book courts. After assessing 15
                        potential solutions we selected TennisBookings. It seemed to be just what we were looking for: uncomplicated and
                        geared exactly to our type of club. The best part of our TB experience by far has been the personalized attention.
                        Starting during our evaluation phase and continuing during implementation, I received a timely email or phone
                        response each and every time. In this day of "you figure it out" this was a wonderful change. We ended up
                        implementing TB smoothly over a 2 week period, winning over even the most skeptical members.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As hoped, we
                        now cannot imagine living without the system."

        "I started looking for a court management system for the 2009-10 season, and did look
                        at various alternatives, but found tennisbookings to be significantly more user-friendly
                        and attractive to use. And after using it over the past two years, I am still very
                        happy with it and so are our members, who still compliment us on getting the system.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's both very easy and intuitive to administer, and very easy for our members to
                        use as well. It's very flexible and adaptable to your club's hours and booking rules,
                        and the help desk at tennisbookings is amazingly responsive, courteous and understandable.
                        If there's any problem/request, they basically fix it within 24 hours.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can regularly update and upload your membership list to the site, which
                        makes it very easy for the club stewards to manage the bookings that are still done
                        at the club, and check if a person is a member. It's also cut down significantly
                        on our booking phone-ins, and associated aggravation from misunderstood messages
                        and booking errors and conflicts etc.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When members ask the system for an account, it generates an email that you can direct
                        to the person(s) best suited to approve it. That has allowed us to accept them usually
                        on the same day, which means they can start booking almost immediately.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can allow members to choose to publicly show their name on a booking or
                        not, and you can publicly show the court use for each court, from a list of uses
                        you can define yourself - doubles, singles, tournament, maintenance, etc, etc. You
                        can advertise events, although we still use our own website for that. You can run
                        events and allow online sign-ups, specifying number of players, waiting list.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are also many reports which you can generate - who booked what court, who
                        cancelled when, etc. etc. And everything is very easy to find. Sorry I couldn't
                        find something critical to say to perhaps appear more objective, but our experience
                        has just been entirely positive, and the learning curve was very short!"

        "The Portland Tennis Center and St. Johns Racquet, both facilities operated by Portland
                        Parks and Recreation, began using the tennisbookings system in March 2011 for our
                        7 indoor courts and 8 outdoor courts. The result has been significant increased
                        court usage, a reduction of more than 80% in our phone calls, convenience for our
                        customers and audit capability. Because of the initial success, we have added more
                        than 20 additional outdoor courts throughout the City.

        "Tennisbookings.com has helped our tennis facility more than double the amount of
                        revenue we brought in our first two years of operations. The ease of setting up
                        programs and processing payments has freed up our management to focus on growing
                        tennis programming versus dealing with labor-intensive paper registration sheets
                        and processing transactions individually. From court and ball-machine rentals to
                        private and group tennis lesson bookings, the system is a true time saver.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our members have enjoyed using the system to register themselves and family members
                        in a simple and practical format. They enjoy the ability to view the court availability
                        without having to call in and try to speak to someone about booking a court.

        "Our not for profit tennis club of 600 members is based in Melbourne, Australia. We commissioned the
                        TennisBookings system during March 2012 as a replacement for a manual, paper based court booking system.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Since implementing the system, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our members and
                        volunteer staff.  Our members find the online system to be very intuitive and simple to use.  The system has
                        reduced the workload on our volunteer court administrator and we have observed a discernible rise in court
                        utilisation. In parallel with the introduction of the system, we instigated a number of policy changes which the
                        system is able to enforce (for example,  maximum court bookings per member) – we now have a fairer and more
                        equitable means of allocating courts to members.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We would recommend the system to those clubs seeking a fully featured, professionally developed system
                        supported by  a strongly customer-focussed team"

        "It is a pleasure for me to write a testimonial for Tennisbookings, our online reservation
                        system. I highly recommend the system to any tennis facility. I am the Director
                        at the Bobcat Tennis Center in Bozeman, Montana, we have four indoor courts and
                        eight out. Using the Tennisbookings online reservation system has been a huge improvement
                        for our facility on many levels.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Most importantly the system allows my front desk staff to easily track membership
                        status to ensure everyone on the court reservation has paid. Our pro staff and I
                        can easily make changes and reserve courts from our phones, I-pads and home computers,
                        so reservations and cancelations are much more accurate now. Scheduling in programs
                        and lessons months ahead is no problem and since our facility is at max capacity
                        in the winter, our reservation system is much smoother and easier for our members.
                        Tennisbookings also makes it much easier for me to track court usage and generate
                        court utilization reports.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Paul has set up our system specifically so it works perfectly for the Bobcat Tennis
                        Center. He has been a great pleasure to work with. He always answers the phone when
                        we call with questions and replies immediately when we need help with anything.

        "As one of the busiest tennis clubs in the country - boasting 18 courts - the
                        TennisBookings.com
                        system has revolutionized our club’s reservation process. Allowing members to book
                        online has been a great feature, and our court usage has increased because the members
                        have been able to see (and reserve) the available court times. Likewise, our staff
                        are no longer under fire for any reservation errors, since the reservation process
                        is placed in the member’s hands, and designed to be much more error proof. The ability
                        to audit the history of a reservation allows management the ability to hold staff
                        accountable when there is a reservation discrepancy or cancellation, resulting in
                        less errors and better training of staff.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our Club has been able to elevate the level of service at our Sports Desk now that
                        the task of taking reservations has been lifted from these employees. The program
                        is enjoyed by members and staff alike, and a real win- win for Manhattan Country
                        Club! Tennisbookings.com has always provided speedy and prompt customer service
                        and they made our transition online smooth and effortless. We love TennisBookings.com!

                        and are very pleased with the program and the customer service from TennisBookings.
                        The customer service staff has always been very quick to respond. They have also
                        been clear and creative in finding a solution if we have a question or need. Briefly
                        the court scheduling system has: Reduced our labor costs in bookings, cancellations
                        and billing Allowed clients the ability to book/cancel or change court reservations
                        24/7 Allowed clients the ability to see open courts and fill them Allowed us an
                        easy way to contact all members Allowed us a good way of tracking court usage Overall
                        the program is flexible and easy to use. I have never had a member call me and ask
                        for directions on how to book a court. I can highly recommend TennisBookings."

        "The Village of Oak Creek Association, in Sedona (AZ), has been using the TennisBookings
                        system for the past year. We have 2 tennis courts and about 50 members. The system
                        replaced a manual sign-up sheet, which had a myriad of problems. The TennisBooking
                        system has been absolutely problem-free.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We have more than our share of ‘computer-challenged’ users, but everyone found it
                        easy to use and is now very enthusiastic. There was virtually no learning curve.
                        Members make their reservations from home (or from any computer anywhere), and can
                        easily see what courts are free and when. There are no conflicts, arguments, or
                        'accidental erasures.'
        <br/>
        As system administrator, I frequently forget that I have any duties at all. I added
                        a new account from a cruise ship in the Mediterranean, and several times from my
                        i-phone. The system provides true web-based convenience.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We support public drop-in play for certain times of the day. The TennisBookings
                        staff actually proposed and implemented several custom features to facilitate this.
                        I have been very impressed with their service. Thank you very much

        The Tennis Bookings Reservation site has revolutionized

                        to our members by creating one easily accessible place for pre-approved members
                        to reserve their own court, sign up for any tennis event, and access the latest
                        tennis information through live links much like a website within a website. From
                        the administration side, it has drastically reduced the time needed to pre-reserve
                        courts for lessons, league matches, and special events. It also allows us to have
                        a tangible record keeping source with easy access to member information for billing

        Our tennis club has been using the Tennis Booking

        I have found the TennisBookings system to be the
                        answer to many issues we faced. Tops on the list are: • It provides us with

        </span>
        readily accessible communication system with our members
                        for program schedules and special events; • It is an easy method of equal opportunity
                        for all members to get the reservations they want, and a visual
        <span lang="en-us">

        to see
        <span lang="en-us">

        other times are available. This has
        <span lang="en-us">
         led to a
        </span>
        more equal distribution of court times throughout
                        the day and by all club members, not just the ones that used to hit the phone redial
                        button time after time in the mornings... • It has reduced our front desk staffing
                        needs from 2 people during prime times on duty, to only one person during most hours
                        of the day.

                        improved our bottom-line. Some of the most notable benefits have been:
        <br/>
        (1) provides up-to-the-minute availability and reservation access to players where
                        ever they are 24/7,

        (2) very intuitive to use with no staff or customer training needed,
        <br/>
        (3) always prompt and helpful customer service,
        <br/>
        (4) allows us to generate an historical record of usage to better predict future
                        demand.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Court utilization and member satisfaction is up while our front-desk staffing needs
                        are down. The system more than pays for itself by selling otherwise unused court

        We switched to Tennis Bookings online reservation
                        system in March 2010 and couldn’t be happier with the results. The membership has
                        embraced the ease of use and can’t imagine not having this option to book their
                        court times online. It has made reserving a court quick and easy.
        <br/>

        When we’ve had any questions regarding any of our set-up particulars, Paul has been
                        quick to respond with an answer or solution. We would highly recommend Tennis Bookings
                        to anyone looking for an online booking reservation system.

        We recently made the switch from a phone reservation
                        system to tennisbookings.com. The transition went very smoothly and our members
                        are very happy with the change. I was the interface between our club and tennisbookings
                        during system implementation, and as such brought little to no technical skills
                        in terms of getting such a system up and running. However, Tennisbookings did a
                        nice job of getting me up to speed without undue pain. They were extremely helpful
                        throughout the transition process.

        Due to budget constraints, our front-desk is normally
                        staffed for only a few hours a day.
        <span lang="en-us">
         This used to mean

        we were often missing out on revenue-earning court bookings because we had no one
                        available to answer the phone. However, since we went live with the TennisBookings
                        system we can now take bookings 24/7, and this has definitely improved our revenue!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The fact that many bookings are now also
        <b>
         paid for
        </b>
        online further reduces
                        our need for front-desk staffing. The same applies for our annual membership dues
                        – most of these are now paid for online and this has significantly reduced this
                        yearly headache for our staff.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The online system is helping to increase revenue and at the same time decreasing
                        our operating costs. I remember one particular weekend when, due to early completion
                        of a college tournament, we suddenly had a lot of available court-time. A quick
                        email blast to our members about the open courts had a terrific response and the
                        courts quickly filled-up with paid-for bookings – even though there was nobody at
                        the front desk! The extra income from this one afternoon more than paid for our
                        use of the online system for many months.

        "We are delighted with the introduction of the Tennis Bookings court scheduler at
                        our Club Torrey Pines apartment community in San Diego. Previously we had relied
                        on a simple sign-up board at the courts however, this really only provided for a
                        “first come/first served” walk-up basis for court usage and we wanted to do more.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        By implementing Tennis Bookings’ system we now have an electronic tool whereby our
                        residents can book a court from home, while traveling on business or anywhere they
                        can access the internet. Upon installation and after sending out a memo to our 480
                        resident units explaining the system, we saw an immediate use of the system for
                        court bookings and received comments from our residents complimenting us on providing
                        this efficient way of reserving a court.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We also installed a kiosk at the court center where residents can walk up, see availability
                        and claim a court at that time. Concurrent with adding the court scheduler we provided
                        for one court to be dual striped to allow either traditional tennis or use as a
                        pair of Pickleball courts. While this was a new concept for Tennis Bookings, they
                        quickly understood our objective and provided a modification to their standard system
                        to allow for booking either tennis or Pickleball.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The system is great but the support from Tennis Bookings is even better. From our
                        initial inquiry, all the way through planning and implementation, and now as we
                        operate with the system in place we have received immediate and simple-to-understand
                        support from Tennis Bookings. The process could not have been easier to add this
                        excellent component to our racquet center."
