					For years, users navigated the Internet largely through a single search engine from their desktop computer. This simple system allowed user intent to be easily identified and advertised against. Today, user intent is fracturing across many traffic sources, devices, and operating systems - creating complexities for businesses seeking to reach their audience. In order to win in this multi-screen, varied-intent digital world, search marketers must be able to price each advertising opportunity individually.
