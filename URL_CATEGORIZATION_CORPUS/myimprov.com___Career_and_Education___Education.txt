        While the topics contained in our curriculum relate to very serious traffic safety matters, we use humor as a tool for learning, which has proven to be highly effective. We are proud to announce that we are one of a very few courses in the nation that have undergone numerous independent studies and have proved to reduce traffic crashes and future violations by 64%.  This claim is substantiated by two independent studies conducted by the

       </h2>
       <p class="description-mobile-desktop margin-bottom-md-half">
        Extensive research has proven that most crashes occur because of the human element.  Lack of technical knowledge rarely causes a collision. More commonly, it is attributed to the wrong attitude of the driver.
       </p>
       <p class="description-mobile-desktop margin-bottom-md-half faq-description-margin-bottom-last">
        Using this research as a foundation, the course was created by psychologists who specialize in the psychology of driving; incorporating our approach of combining education and entertainment which actually makes learning fun!

By using our Services with your browser set to accept cookies, you are consenting to our use of cookies in the manner described herein. We may collect data about your use of the Services through the use of cookies, Internet server logs, tracking pixels (also called web beacons) and similar technologies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website, that enables us to recognize your computer/device, store your preferences and settings, enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform searches and analytics, and assist with security administrative functions.

          We use third parties to assist us in advertising, tracking aggregated and/or de-identified site usage statistics, and providing content-sharing services to support the Services. These third parties may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect similar information about your use of the Services. For instance, the cookies may reflect de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., a hashed version of your email address, which we may share with service providers, solely in non-human readable form. We do not control these third-party technologies, and their use is governed by those parties’ privacy policies.
          <br/>
          We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to our site. These cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using our Services. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in. Another type of cookies is Flash cookies, which are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files and help in the viewing of content that uses the Adobe Flash player.

For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” web form, IEC will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services.

       Terms of Use

     <div class="modal-body">
      <p>
       These Terms of Use (the “
       <strong>
        Terms of Use
       </strong>
       ”) governs each Customer’s use of content, learning management systems and other services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Interactive Education Concepts, Inc. (“IEC”), its Affiliates, agents, or contractors to Customer.
       <strong>
        Please read these Terms of Use carefully.
       </strong>
       These Terms of Use are subject to change after 30 days’ notice is given by IEC via this website, and as such the Customer is solely responsible for checking this website for changes to these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use, together with the License Agreement between IEC and Customer, will supersede any prior discussions or representations regarding the Services. If there is a conflict between the Terms of Use and the License Agreement, the terms of the License Agreement will prevail, but only with respect to the Services licensed through that particular License Agreement.

      <p>
       <strong>
        1.1. Free Trials.
       </strong>
       Should Customer agree to these Terms of Use as part of a free trial, then this section 1.1 shall apply. When Customer first agrees to these terms, IEC allows for a fourteen (14) day free trial (“Free Trial Period”) of the Services for no more than ten (10) Active Users to use the Services on behalf of Customer with no payment obligation and no obligation of continued subscription past the Free Trial Period. IEC shall have the right to immediately suspend Services upon expiration of Customer’s Free Trial Period. To avoid any such interruption of Services, Customer may elect to continue using the Services after its Free Trial Period by accepting a written License Agreement, which will set forth the Services, the subscription Term, the number of users (and how defined), pricing, fees (“On-Demand Fees”), and reference to these Terms of Use. Customer acknowledges and agrees that these Terms of Use will govern Customer’s use of Services during any Free Trial Period and any paid subscription Term for which Customer accepts a License Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ANY CUSTOMER DATA THAT CUSTOMER ENTERS OR PROVIES WHILE USING THE SERVICES DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD MAY BE PERMANENTLY LOST UNLESS CUSTOMER PURCHASES A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SAME SERVICES AS THOSE COVERED BY THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD. CUSTOMER MUST EXPORT ITS CUSTOMER DATA BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD TO AVOID THE RISK THAT CUSTOMER DATA WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOST.

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1.2 Provision of the Services
       </strong>
       . IEC will make available to Customer on a subscription basis for the Term the Services set forth in an Order pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Order. Services are designed to be available 24/7 subject to maintenance and reasonable downtime. Customer will be notified of scheduled maintenance. IEC will, as part of providing a Service, apply any update, bug fix or upgrade to the Service that it makes generally available to its customers of the Service. Services are subject to usage limits, including for example, the quantities specified in an accepted Order. IEC reserves the right to modify the course offerings and content of the online course library at any time.

       <strong>
        1.3 Customer Obligations
       </strong>
       . Customer may enable access of the Services for use only by Active Users solely for the internal business purposes of Customer and its Affiliates in accordance with these Terms of Use and not for the benefit of any third parties. Customer is responsible for all Authorized Persons’ use of the Services and compliance with these Terms of Use and the applicable License Agreement(s). Customer shall: (a) have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of all Customer Data that is transmitted or otherwise provided to IEC and the means by which Customer acquired Customer Data; (b) ensure that all users receive any required disclosures and appropriate training concerning the use of the Services; (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the Services, and notify IEC promptly of any such unauthorized access or use; (d) promptly inform IEC when the number of Active Users increases; and (e) use the Services(s) only in accordance with this Agreement, the Documentation and any applicable Laws. Customer shall not: (i) use the Services in violation of applicable Laws; (ii) in connection with the Services, send or store infringing, obscene, threatening, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, including material that violates privacy rights. Customer shall be liable for the acts and omissions of all Authorized Persons and Customer Affiliates relating to this Agreement. If Customer installs or enables a third-party application for use with any Service, Customer (i) is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining the license or other rights for its use of the third-party application, and (ii) grants IEC permission to allow the provider of that third-party application to access Customer Data as required for the interoperation of the third-party application and the Service.

       . During the Term of this Agreement, IEC shall establish, implement and maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical measures that are designed to protect the security and integrity of Customer Data that is provided to IEC by Customer, and that are reasonably appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and nature of the provided Customer Data to be protected, and designed to guard against the accidental or unauthorized access, use, loss or disclosure of Customer Data while it is on IEC’s network and systems.

       If either party believes that there has been unauthorized access, use, loss or disclosure of Customer Data while it is on IEC’s network and systems, such party must promptly notify the other party. Additionally, each party will reasonably assist the other party in investigating, remediating or mitigating any potential damage, including providing reasonable assistance with respect to any legally required notifications concerning the disclosure or the provision of credit reporting services to such individuals. Each party shall bear its own costs of such investigation, remediation, mitigation and/or notification associated with an unauthorized disclosure.

       </strong>
       . The Fees shall be set out in each License Agreement. By electing credit card payment and inputting its billing and credit card information into the IEC system (via a link sent by IEC), Customer’s credit card on file will be charged in advance the annual On-Demand Fees and/or Content Licensing Fees for the Term (including any agreed-to renewal term), provided that Customer remains responsible for All Fees. Upon the failure of any credit card payment, IEC will invoice Customer for Fees and interest at the monthly rate of 1.5% or lesser maximum allowable, and Customer will pay IEC’s invoice within thirty days of the invoice date. IEC will also invoice Customer (or if applicable, charge Customer’s credit card) at the time Customer adds any enhanced or additional Services. If Customer exceeds any usage limitation set forth in the License Agreement, IEC will invoice Customer for the overages in arears. Fees will be billed and paid in USD, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.

        A. “Confidential Information” means
       </strong>
       all information disclosed by a party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”), orally or in writing, designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstance of disclosure. Customer’s Confidential Information includes Customer Data; IEC’s Confidential Information includes the Services, Content and Documentation; and Confidential Information of each party includes each party’s proprietary technology and technical information, business processes and technical product information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        B. Exclusions
       </strong>
       . Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the other party; (ii) was known to a party prior to its disclosure by the other party without breach of any obligation owed to the other party; (iii) was independently developed by a party without breach of any obligation owed to the other party; or (iv) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the other party.

       <strong>
        4.2 Confidentiality Obligations
       </strong>
       . During the course of the parties’ business relationship, each party may have access to Confidential Information of the other party. Neither party shall disclose any Confidential Information of the other party, orally or in writing, to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party, except as provided in these Terms of Use. The parties shall protect each other’s Confidential Information using commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        4.3 Disclosure to Third Parties and as Required by Law
       </strong>
       . Recipient may provide access to and use of Discloser’s Confidential Information only to those third parties that: (a) provide services to Recipient concerning Recipient’s use of Discloser’s Confidential Information; (b) have a need to use and access the Confidential Information; and (c) have agreed to substantially similar non-disclosure obligations as those contained in this Agreement. Recipient shall be responsible for the use by its third parties of the Discloser’s Confidential Information. To the extent Recipient may be required by Law to disclose Confidential Information, Recipient may make such disclosure, provided that Recipient (i) to the extent permitted by Law, notifies Discloser of such requirement prior to disclosure and (ii) allows Discloser to take reasonable action to avoid and/or limit disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        4.4 Injunctive Relief and other Remedies
       </strong>
       . Each party understands that Confidential Information constitutes valuable business assets of Discloser and its disclosure may irreparably harm Discloser. In the event of breach or threatened breach of obligations pertaining to Confidential Information by Recipient, Discloser shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief. In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information that only includes Customer Data, Customer shall have the sole right to pursue the remedies set forth in Sections 2.2 and 9 of these Terms of Use. Any other potential remedies related to a breach of this section for Confidential Information that does not include Customer Data are subject to all other provisions in these Terms of Use.

      </p>
      <p>
       B. Solely during the Term, the right to use the Content on a third party Learning Management System provided that IEC does not warrant and bears no responsibility for availability and functionality of the Content on a third party LMS.

        5.5 Aggregated Data Use
       </strong>
       . Without limiting the confidentiality rights and protections set forth in this Agreement, IEC owns and has the perpetual right to use for its business and or operating purposes the aggregated and statistical data derived from the operation of the Services, including, without limitation, the number of records in the Services, the number and types of transactions, configurations, and reports processed in the Services, and the performance results for the Services (the “Aggregated Data”). Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting IEC from utilizing the Aggregated Data for purposes of operating IEC’s business, provided that IEC’s use of Aggregated Data will not reveal the identity, whether directly or indirectly, of any individual or specific data entered by any individual while utilizing the Services. In no event does the Aggregated Data include any Customer Confidential Information, Customer Data or any information that personally identifies a specific individual.

       <strong>
        6.4 Dispute Resolution

       . Prior to instituting formal proceedings, the parties shall attempt to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use and any License Agreement informally. To invoke this process a party shall appoint a designated executive and request that the other party do the same. The other party shall make such appointment within five (5) days of receipt of the request. The designated executives shall then have up to thirty (30) days to attempt in good faith to resolve the matter. The informal dispute resolution process shall terminate at the end of the thirty (30) day period unless extended by mutual agreement. Disputes not resolved by informal dispute resolution as provided in this section will be resolved by litigation unless the parties mutually agree to an alternative dispute resolution method such as arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this section shall prevent, or be construed as preventing, a party from (a) instituting formal proceedings to avoid the expiration of any applicable limitations period, or (b) seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parties agree that any legal action arising from these Terms of Use or any License Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California.
