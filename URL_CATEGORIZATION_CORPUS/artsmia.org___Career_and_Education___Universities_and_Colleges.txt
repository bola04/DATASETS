A large, white teddy bear sat propped against a white wall; it would later be ripped open, filled with lead, and titled \u003cem\u003eComfort Object\u003c/em\u003e. On the opposite wall lay an assortment of clear glass ornaments; soon, the ornaments would be connected by wire and suspended from the ceiling to resemble a child’s mobile—though some of the glass would be intentionally broken below. Imady dubbed this installation \u003cem\u003eFragile\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhen we met, a week before her exhibition, \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/essma-imady/\"\u003eThicker than Water\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026#8221; opened as the current Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) show at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, she was clearly feeling the tension of the whole experience, an anxiety that had been building for months. Knowing that her deeply personal art—loaded with ironies like a lead-filled comfort object and a dangerously fragile mobile—would soon be on view to the public was overwhelming. Though, she confessed to me, “I’m just an anxious person.”\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn fact, Imady used her stress and anxiety to fuel the creation of this show. By exposing her own uncertainties and struggles, she enables viewers to sense that they have connected to the work on a personal level, a connection she hopes will persist, sprouting new conceptions about these ideas, long after her exhibition is gone.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFrom Syria to Minnesota\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n“You probably want me to say I started art at age 3, when I started painting Picassos,\u0026#8221; Imady joked. But her origins are not that simple.\u003cbr /\u003e\nImady grew up in Damascus, the capital of Syria, one of the oldest consistently inhabited cities in the world. Her mother worked as a tour guide, often steering American and British tourists through the city\u0026#8217;s layers of artistic and architectural history dating back thousands of years.\u003cbr /\u003e\nDespite this history, Imady never had access to art classes through Syria\u0026#8217;s public schools. She didn\u0026#8217;t consider herself an artist in her youth, though she often crafted artwork for friends and family. After high school, Imady decided to pursue higher education, but a career in art would not cross her mind until much later.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn Syria, Imady explained, “You don’t go to college and decide what you want to do. Before you go into college you have to pick which one you want to go to. Chemistry college, medical college, and then that’s it. You don’t have the space to decide.” Having never considered art as a possible career path or even much of a personal interest, Imady enrolled in a chemistry college.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I try to control it now, but back then I was a people pleaser,” Imady revealed, laughing quietly. \u0026#8220;So since I was a people pleaser I went to chemistry college for three years and it was terrible! It wasn’t terrible for everyone, but it was for me. Chemistry was just not an option.” Eventually she felt compelled to leave the school, for her own well-being.\u003cbr /\u003e\nShe was faced with the decision to either drop her pursuit of a college degree entirely or start over at a completely new school. Fortunately, the Syrian government had recently allowed the first few private universities to open in the country. Thanks to her father’s connection to one of these new universities, near Damascus, Imady became aware of an art program the school was offering and enrolled. “So,” she answered more confidently, “it all started from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_63634\" style=\"max-width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-63634\" src=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Imady-vest-e1527196135632-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Imady's \u0026quot;Coming-Home Outfit\u0026quot;\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eComing-Home Outfit\u003c/em\u003e, from \u0026#8220;Thicker than Water.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSyria\u0026#8217;s civil war, however, soon escalated in Daraa, where her new university was located. Tanks could be seen from her classroom windows. When her husband received a Fulbright scholarship to St. Cloud State University, in Minnesota, Imady jumped at the opportunity to leave the violence and complete her education in the United States.\u003cbr /\u003e\nShe received her BA from St. Cloud State and was accepted to a Master\u0026#8217;s program at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. Then she discovered she was pregnant with her first child, and anxiety struck again. Imady struggled to see how raising a child and going to school would work together. She deferred her acceptance for a year, but with no real intention of attending in the future.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAfter the birth of her daughter, Imady told me, she experienced intense anxiety around parenthood and fell into a bit of an emotional slump. Though she thought pursuing her education could be a great way to put her back in a positive headspace after childbirth, she was still doubtful of her ability to handle the dual responsibilities of motherhood and an education.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I just had a kid!” she exclaimed. “I thought it was impossible for me to go to grad school. But my mom said, ‘Just do it, maybe you’ll figure it out.’”\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eExplaining war\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nImady earned her MFA in 2016, and \u003cem\u003eThicker Than Water\u003c/em\u003e stems directly from her time at MCAD. In her final semester, while considering topics for her final thesis, she asked the question, “How do you explain war to a 4-year-old?” And although she ultimately pursued a different topic for her thesis, the question continued to burn in the back of her mind.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eReceiving Blanket, \u003c/em\u003efeatured in \u0026#8220;Thicker than Water,\u0026#8221;\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ewas the first piece inspired by that prompt. The soft throw-blanket is printed with a photograph taken by a Russian drone of bombed, crumbling Syrian buildings. The piece poses a striking contrast between the comfort of a soft blanket and the harsh reality of violence and destruction still happening in Syria today.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMore art followed, and in 2017 she received a Travel and Study Grant from the Jerome Foundation to continue this work in Istanbul, Turkey. There, she designed a light fixture for a mosque and studied traditional Islamic art forms.\u003cbr /\u003e\nShe also visited many of her friends. They, too, had been forced out of their homes by the violence in Syria. But unlike Imady, most of her friends and family had relocated to Istanbul and started families there. Her counterparts have young children who are aware of their current circumstances, and Imady seized the opportunity to interview these children while she was still in Istanbul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_63637\" style=\"max-width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-63637\" src=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jbei5-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"Imady at Mia.\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" /\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eImady at Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of \u0026#8220;Thicker Than Water,\u0026#8221; Imady presents these interviews along with others she recorded in Winnipeg, Canada, which also has a large Syrian refugee population. The interviews primarily highlight the experiences of childhood: future goals, funny stories, family life. Many of the children in the large collage of videos smile, bounce, and laugh with their siblings. But Imady asked the children to consider their status as refugees, as well, and some of the children in the videos elaborate on their difficult journeys from Syria. Others reveal that they feel anxious at their new schools, in their new homes.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I visualize the entire series in terms of anxiety,” Imady said of the art in the show. After having her child, Imady struggled with plenty of anxieties that all parents face. However, she began recognizing that some anxieties were more specific to her experiences as a refugee. “I wanted to touch on the anxiety of language, heritage, history, safety, comfort.”\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eMother Tongue\u003c/em\u003e, a procession of tongues coated in letters, reflects on anxieties related to one’s first language and the struggles to learn a new one. \u003cem\u003eSafety Net\u003c/em\u003e, which consists of a pile of faux rocks in a safety-pin hammock, hangs precariously over the heads of visitors as they enter the second gallery space and invokes anxieties about immediate safety.\u003cbr /\u003e\nHowever, Imady’s art is accessible to more than refugees and parents. As a practice, Imady asks her audiences to find a personal connection to the pieces and develop their analysis from a place of experience. Rather than dictating what she would like them to take away from \u0026#8220;Thicker Than Water,\u0026#8221; Imady hopes that visitors leave with their own ideas and meanings. Her work is not a call to any particular action, she stresses, nor is she attempting to produce the “right message.\u0026#8221; Her artworks, she said, are simply “seeds.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I hope people come away with something small,\u0026#8221; she said. \u0026#8220;Something that, when nourished in the correct ways, could grow into something larger and could perhaps challenge a preconception or offer a different outlook. I don’t want to define what those outlooks or conceptions are. I don’t want people to assume that I am trying to define them or make a call for a specific action. I’m planting seeds.”\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u0026#8220;Thicker Than Water\u0026#8221; will be on view at Mia through June 24, 2018. Imady is continuing to work on other exciting projects in Minneapolis, including events at the Walker Art Center surrounding ideas of international voices and “who can speak for whom in art.\u0026#8221;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eWhen I first met Essma Imady, she was pacing through a mostly empty gallery, glancing among her unassembled installation pieces, and occasionally fidgeting with her singular dinosaur earring.

The dolls suggest a life of leisure—at least for the white couple in evening wear slumped on a settee upstairs, exhausted by gaiety and Champagne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_63466\" style=\"max-width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/African-American-doll.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"wp-image-63466\" src=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/African-American-doll.jpg\" alt=\"The doll at a February event at Mia called \u0026quot;We Need to Talk.\u0026quot;\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eThe doll at a February event at Mia called \u0026#8220;We Need to Talk.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doll from the glass case, however, is dressed for work. She wears the white kerchief and apron of a turn-of-the-century maid. For years, she stood in the servant\u0026#8217;s kitchen, her back turned to the viewer. Which is where Andrea Pierre noticed her, and so did her two young daughters. The girls wondered about the only African American doll in the house and loved checking in on her, and Andrea seized their interest to talk with them about race and representation in art museums and society at large.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAnd then the doll was gone. Removed by museum staff after complaints that her presence was offensive, that she represents a stereotype. Which of course she does: the black person as servant. She could be seen as the dutiful, self-sacrificing \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype\"\u003e“mammy,”\u003c/a\u003e said to love her white family as her own, a bit of self-serving folklore that persisted in white culture, \u003ca href=\"http://www.csus.edu/mcnair/_all-scholars-articles-photos-webpage/15_2013_2014/jounal_2013-14/dorian-love-mcnairjournal15-2013-14_single-page.pdf\"\u003eespecially film\u003c/a\u003e, through the 20th century. But she was also a touchstone, a conversation starter, a rare embodiment of blackness in the museum, whose story—like that of every doll—can be written and rewritten by the viewer.\u003cbr /\u003e\nPierre was disturbed, her children disappointed. And when \u003ca href=\"https://videos.artsmia.org\"\u003eshe took it up with the museum\u003c/a\u003e, an unusual series of events unfolded. Filmmakers documented Pierre discussing the doll and other uncomfortable issues around race with other African-American women: Erin Sharkey, Junauda Petrus and Aisha Mgeni. Then the women went onstage at Mia to cover some of the same ground—the event where the doll held court as a goddess—and argued that removing the doll was a well-intended mistake with unintended consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_63502\" style=\"max-width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dollhouse-nursery.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"wp-image-63502\" src=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dollhouse-nursery.jpg\" alt=\"dollhouse nursery\" width=\"350\" height=\"225\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eThe doll\u0026#8217;s new placement, in the nursery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tossed the doll aside like she didn’t matter,” Mgeni said of the museum. “And she mattered.” Better to keep the doll and talk about her, the women suggested.  “I can think of 50 ways to make the conversation richer,” said Sharkey. “Commission work imagining her life, make six dollhouses [with diverse dolls], have better signage. … It feels like an amazing opportunity to have a conversation that’s deep and hard and could be fun.”\u003cbr /\u003e\nThis week, the doll is back. She has been returned to the nursery, where she appears in a photograph of the dollhouse as it used to be, before it was delivered to Mia. Standing over a cradle, facing the viewer. With an iPad nearby explaining this background. So that anyone looking in can imagine her life and the women she embodies. And the conversations about race and representation, like those that Pierre and her daughters have had, can continue.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eTop image: Andrea Pierre and her daughters peering

Cottman added, “There’s room for expansion, added there’s room for a wider vision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"normal\"\u003eWebster questioned whether leadership change was enough. “What if an alternative future requires that certain institutions die?” he suggested. “I don’t know that institutions that are so closely tied to colonialism can be repurposed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"normal\"\u003e“I think we need to be building not institutions, but the way we make and celebrate art,” said Sharkey. “It’s often a weird dynamic in museums because art spurs new ideas, but institutions are so traditional.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"normal\"\u003eThe panelists all spoke to the importance of imagination and speculation in their own practices, reimagining a future through art. “It’s impossible not to think about the future you’re creating with every object, with every thought you express or produce,” said Senah Yeboah-Sampong. Creating art is an expression of humanity, he said. It opens a dialogue and encourages others to do the same. “I try to use my work desperately to affirm and express my humanity and hopefully influence a better tomorrow for other people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"normal\"\u003eThis is the power of art and imagination, though as Sharkey qualified, imagination requires effort and flexibility. “It\u0026#8217;s not something that’s inherent to us, it’s a muscle we have to work,” she said. “I want to continue to do this work, I want to continue to invite other people to see imagination as this really dynamic thing we gotta invest in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"normal\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTop image: Panelists for Mia\u0026#8217;s \u003c/em\u003eAfrofuturism and the Urgency of (Re)Imagination discussion\u003cem\u003e, clockwise from left: Erin Sharkey, Senah Yeboah-Sampong, Beverly \u003c/em\u003e\u003ci\u003eCottman, and Chaun Webster.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003eAmong the accomplishments of Black Panther—first all-black superhero movie, 10th highest-grossing film of all time—is something that African-American artists have awaited for a long time: the mainstream emergence of Afrofuturism.

occasionally fidgeting with her singular dinosaur earring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_63633\" style=\"max-width: 273px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-full

mother\u0026#8217;s weight in lead.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer art was scattered along the perimeter of the long, rectangular gallery, most of it unfinished. A large, white teddy bear sat propped against a white wall; it would later be ripped open, filled with lead, and titled \u003cem\u003eComfort Object\u003c/em\u003e. On the opposite wall lay an assortment of clear glass ornaments; soon, the ornaments would be connected by wire and suspended from the ceiling to resemble a child’s mobile—though some of the glass would be intentionally broken below. Imady dubbed this installation \u003cem\u003eFragile\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhen we met, a week before her exhibition, \u0026#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://new.artsmia.org/exhibition/essma-imady/\"\u003eThicker than Water\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026#8221; opened as the current Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) show at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, she was clearly feeling the tension of the whole experience, an anxiety that had been building for months. Knowing that her deeply personal art—loaded with ironies like a lead-filled comfort object and a dangerously fragile mobile—would soon be on view to the public was overwhelming. Though, she confessed to me, “I’m just an anxious person.”\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn fact, Imady used her stress and anxiety to fuel the creation of this show. By exposing her own uncertainties and struggles, she enables viewers to sense that they have connected to the work on a personal level, a connection she hopes will persist, sprouting new conceptions about these ideas, long after her exhibition is gone.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFrom Syria to Minnesota\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n“You probably want me to say I started art at age 3, when I started painting Picassos,\u0026#8221; Imady joked. But her origins are not that simple.\u003cbr /\u003e\nImady grew up in Damascus, the capital of Syria, one of the oldest consistently inhabited cities in the world. Her mother worked as a tour guide, often steering American and British tourists through the city\u0026#8217;s layers of artistic and architectural history dating back thousands of years.\u003cbr /\u003e\nDespite this history, Imady never had access to art classes through Syria\u0026#8217;s public schools. She didn\u0026#8217;t consider herself an artist in her youth, though she often crafted artwork for friends and family. After high school, Imady decided to pursue higher education, but a career in art would not cross her mind until much later.\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn Syria, Imady explained, “You don’t go to college and decide what you want to do. Before you go into college you have to pick which one you want to go to. Chemistry college, medical college, and then that’s it. You don’t have the space to decide.” Having never considered art as a possible career path or even much of a personal interest, Imady enrolled in a chemistry college.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I try to control it now, but back then I was a people pleaser,” Imady revealed, laughing quietly. \u0026#8220;So since I was a people pleaser I went to chemistry college for three years and it was terrible! It wasn’t terrible for everyone, but it was for me. Chemistry was just not an option.” Eventually she felt compelled to leave the school, for her own well-being.\u003cbr /\u003e\nShe was faced with the decision to either drop her pursuit of a college degree entirely or start over at a completely new school. Fortunately, the Syrian government had recently allowed the first few private universities to open in the country. Thanks to her father’s connection to one of these new universities, near Damascus, Imady became aware of an art program the school was offering and enrolled. “So,” she answered more confidently, “it all started from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_63634\" style=\"max-width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-63634\" src=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Imady-vest-e1527196135632-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Imady's \u0026quot;Coming-Home Outfit\u0026quot;\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eComing-Home Outfit\u003c/em\u003e, from \u0026#8220;Thicker than Water.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSyria\u0026#8217;s civil war, however, soon escalated in Daraa, where her new university was located. Tanks could be seen from her classroom windows. When her husband received a Fulbright scholarship to St. Cloud State University, in Minnesota, Imady jumped at the opportunity to leave the violence and complete her education in the United States.\u003cbr /\u003e\nShe received her BA from St. Cloud State and was accepted to a Master\u0026#8217;s program at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. Then she discovered she was pregnant with her first child, and anxiety struck again. Imady struggled to see how raising a child and going to school would work together. She deferred her acceptance for a year, but with no real intention of attending in the future.\u003cbr /\u003e\nAfter the birth of her daughter, Imady told me, she experienced intense anxiety around parenthood and fell into a bit of an emotional slump. Though she thought pursuing her education could be a great way to put her back in a positive headspace after childbirth, she was still doubtful of her ability to handle the dual responsibilities of motherhood and an education.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I just had a kid!” she exclaimed. “I thought it was impossible for me to go to grad school. But my mom said, ‘Just do it, maybe you’ll figure it out.’”\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eExplaining war\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nImady earned her MFA in 2016, and \u003cem\u003eThicker Than Water\u003c/em\u003e stems directly from her time at MCAD. In her final semester, while considering topics for her final thesis, she asked the question, “How do you explain war to a 4-year-old?” And although she ultimately pursued a different topic for her thesis, the question continued to burn in the back of her mind.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eReceiving Blanket, \u003c/em\u003efeatured in \u0026#8220;Thicker than Water,\u0026#8221;\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003ewas the first piece inspired by that prompt.

There, she designed a light fixture for a mosque and studied traditional Islamic art forms.\u003cbr /\u003e\nShe also visited many of her friends. They, too, had been forced out of their homes by the violence in Syria. But unlike Imady, most of her friends and family had relocated to Istanbul and started families there. Her counterparts have young children who are aware of their current circumstances, and Imady seized the opportunity to interview these children while she was still in Istanbul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_63637\" style=\"max-width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-63637\" src=\"http://staging.artsmia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jbei5-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"Imady at Mia.\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" /\u003e\u003cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003eImady at Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of \u0026#8220;Thicker Than Water,\u0026#8221; Imady presents these interviews along with others she recorded in Winnipeg, Canada, which also has a large Syrian refugee population. The interviews primarily highlight the experiences of childhood: future goals, funny stories, family life. Many of the children in the large collage of videos smile, bounce, and laugh with their siblings. But Imady asked the children to consider their status as refugees, as well, and some of the children in the videos elaborate on their difficult journeys from Syria. Others reveal that they feel anxious at their new schools, in their new homes.\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I visualize the entire series in terms of anxiety,” Imady said of the art in the show. After having her child, Imady struggled with plenty of anxieties that all parents face. However, she began recognizing that some anxieties were more specific to her experiences as a refugee. “I wanted to touch on the anxiety of language, heritage, history, safety, comfort.”\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eMother Tongue\u003c/em\u003e, a procession of tongues coated in letters, reflects on anxieties related to one’s first language and the struggles to learn a new one. \u003cem\u003eSafety Net\u003c/em\u003e, which consists of a pile of faux rocks in a safety-pin hammock, hangs precariously over the heads of visitors as they enter the second gallery space and invokes anxieties about immediate safety.\u003cbr /\u003e\nHowever, Imady’s art is accessible to more than refugees and parents. As a practice, Imady asks her audiences to find a personal connection to the pieces and develop their analysis from a place of experience. Rather than dictating what she would like them to take away from \u0026#8220;Thicker Than Water,\u0026#8221; Imady hopes that visitors leave with their own ideas and meanings. Her work is not a call to any particular action, she stresses, nor is she attempting to produce the “right message.\u0026#8221; Her artworks, she said, are simply “seeds.\u0026#8221;\u003cbr /\u003e\n“I hope people come away with something small,\u0026#8221; she said. \u0026#8220;Something that, when nourished in the correct ways, could grow into something larger and could perhaps challenge a preconception or offer a different outlook. I don’t want to define what those outlooks or conceptions are. I don’t want people to assume that I am trying to define them or make a call for a specific action.
