      We human beings on this planet need a new vision 
		  and understanding of life, to help bring us together, to see and feel 
		  and understand our common humanity, to step back from the brink of 
		  self-destruction. From the Moon, together, we can see it, a new 
		  global, universal vision of life. Many millions of people around the 
		  world have already evolved toward such a vision.
      <em>
       The Parliament of Poets
      </em>
      is set partly on the moon and 
		  evokes the story of humanity from Blombos Cave to the dark side of the moon.

      I hope in time

      The story of humanity, from Blombos Cave to the dark side of the moon, drawing from and evoking all of the great spiritual and wisdom traditions and regional civilizations.

       If the old exclusivisms evolved into the exclusivism of the Enlightenment, from the moon, together, we can see universality...

     <p align="justify">
      As a global epic tale, I am speaking to the entire planet, not merely the Western world. While the whole is always more than the sum of its parts, I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to such writers and thinkers as the historian Arnold Toynbee, Carl Jung, Huston Smith, Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell, and many others of open and universal sensibility. Campbell, especially, wrote on shamanism and myth and their power to heal the tribe through a visionary experience and tale. Campbell also wrote repeatedly about the overview Image of Earthrise, rising above the horizon of the moon, as the great new mythic Image and Symbol for our time.

      in 2007. Divided into three sections, these essays and reviews were all written during the 21st Century, with many of them central to his evolving intellectual and spiritual struggle to write his epic poem,
      <em>
       The Parliament of Poets
      </em>
      , which he completed and published in late 2012.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      These essays open up Glaysher’s own biography and his life-long interest in the writings of Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, John Milton, Saul Bellow, Robert Hayden, and other poets and writers, offering a fresh, new vision of literature and culture....

     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      <strong>
       Thirty years in the making,
      </strong>
      set  partly on the moon, at the Apollo 11 landing site, the Sea of Tranquility.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      <strong>
       In a world of Quantum science
      </strong>
      , Apollo, the Greek god of poetry, calls all the poets of the nations, ancient and modern, East and West, to assemble on the moon to consult on the meaning of modernity. The Parliament of Poets sends the Persona, the Poet of the Moon, on a Journey to the seven continents to learn from all of the spiritual and wisdom traditions of humankind. On Earth and on the moon, the poets teach a new global, universal vision of life.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      One of the major themes is the power of women and the female spirit across cultures. Another is the nature of science and religion, including Quantum Physics, as well as the "two cultures," science and the humanities.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      All the great shades appear at the Apollo 11 landing   site in the Sea of Tranquility: Homer and Virgil from the Greek and   Roman civilizations; Dante, Spenser, and Milton hail from the   Judeo-Christian West; Rumi, Attar, and Hafez step forward from Islam; Du   Fu and Li Po, Basho and Zeami, step forth from China and Japan; the   poets of the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana meet on that plain; griots   from Africa; shamans from Indonesia and Australia; Murasaki Shikibu,   Emily Dickinson, and Jane Austen, poets and seers of all Ages, bards,   rhapsodes, troubadours, and minstrels, major and minor, hail across the   halls of time and space.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      That transcendent Rose symbol of our age, the   Earth itself, viewed from the heavens, one world with no visible   boundaries, metaphor of the oneness of the human race, reflects its   blue-green light into the blackness of the starry universe.

      <strong>
       Glaysher is really an epic poet and this is an epic poem!
      </strong>
      To put this in context, in my view the last complete and true epic poem in the English Language was
      <em>
       Paradise Lost
      </em>
      written by John Milton in the 17th century... One can hardly congratulate him enough, then, on this achievement, since it has been so long awaited... One fabulous quality of this poem is its clarity and luminous quality. I love the fact that despite the wide ranging topographical and lexical references this poem is easy to understand and follow: it is a poet writing for people, not one trying to be clever, and not one concealing their lack of poetry in obfuscation.
      <strong>
       Glaysher has written a masterpiece...  I strongly recommend Frederick Glaysher’s poem

       Longer Excerpts from Reviews of
       <em>
        The Parliament of Poets: An Epic Poem
       </em>
      </strong>
     </h3>
     <p align="justify">
      "To put this in context, in my view the last complete and true epic poem in the English Language was
      <em>
       Paradise Lost
      </em>
      written by John Milton in the 17th century, and apart from that poem there are only two others: the anonymous
      <em>
       Beowulf
      </em>
      from old English, and the unfinished
      <em>
       Faerie Queen
      </em>
      by Edmund Spenser from the 16th century.
      <em>
       Don Juan
      </em>
      , by Byron [also unfinished], is perhaps a true mock epic and apart from that the only poet since Milton who has come remotely close to writing in the epic style is Keats with his two sublime, but unfinished and maybe unfinishable (even had he lived),
      <em>
       Hyperion
      </em>
      fragments...
      <br/>
      This brings us to the 20th century and all the phoney poets (Brits and Americans alike) claiming to write epics, “modern epics,” but doing no such thing. The most egregious example of this would be Ezra Pound and his
      <em>
       Cantos
      </em>
      : unreadable and undecipherable rubbish masquerading as a work of genius in the manner we are nowadays too familiar with in conceptual art and music. Indeed, only two types of people ever read the
      <em>
       Cantos
      </em>
      : university professors who make a career out of untangling it; and wannabe poets who write just like that (except of course completely differently – solipsism smears the pane in its own way: there’s a brown smudge, but here’s a green stain) and naturally vote for models justifying their own inanities. (As for modern epics of the “human mind” – beginning Wordsworth, Whitman et al. – these, despite their odd purple patches, seem extended and tedious forms of narcissism)...
      <strong>
       <br/>
       One fabulous quality of this poem is its clarity and luminous quality
      </strong>
      . I love the fact that despite the wide ranging topographical and lexical references this poem is
      <strong>
       easy to understand and follow: it is a poet writing for people
      </strong>
      , not one trying to be clever, and not one concealing their lack of poetry in obfuscation."
      <strong>
       <br/>
       I take the view, therefore, and surprisingly to myself, that Glaysher is really an epic poet and this is an epic poem!
      </strong>
      One can hardly congratulate him enough, then, on this achievement, since it has been so long awaited...
      <strong>
       Glaysher has written a masterpiece
      </strong>
      ...

      . In this earth human beings are part of the Great Mystery’s creation and their duty is to keep the balance and harmony of the universe, to achieve union, to choose sacrifice, and to be self-controlled. In this manner Glaysher sings the song of ‘one Earth, without borders, Mother Earth, her embrace encircling one people, humankind’ (19)…. The lucid and placid feet of the language moves deftly and smoothly from the beginning up to the last line of the poem.

On the other hand, the poem, it should be stated, is not without its odd flashes of humour and dry irony which, once again enriches its overall value as a dynamic and engaging piece of art rather than a dry academic exercise....

      "It seems that an epic poem is just about the perfect container for works that provide insight, humor, and speculation about the bigger issues of life, and I'm so glad I found THE PARLIAMENT OF POETS. The poet's narrator is a seeker, and he has sought to understand both the philosophies that have guided poets and sages, and to understand the Earth from the perspective of a narrator looking down on it from the moon. The narrator makes several trips through outer space and goes back and forth to the moon, as if he were an astronaut. That trope is, indeed, a vital part of this epic poem, a poem that asks us to gather our collective wisdom (as if we were Buzz Aldrins) and apply it to saving the planet and ourselves. The poem is, at times, amusing, serious, philosophical, lyrical, and entertaining.
      <strong>
       I especially enjoyed Don Quixote's cameo appearances. Bravo. A fine and enjoyable read

      "Faced with great suffering and overwhelming obstacles, the journey of the hero is beautifully portrayed in this classic epic poem 'The Parliament of Poets' by Frederick Glaysher.
        Can poets and philosophers be the key to transformation of the world?
      <strong>
       Discover what happens when the greatest poets and philosophers that ever walked the Earth gather on the moon and create a new vision for humanity

     <p align="justify">
      "Glaysher...has shown...that with the right subject matter and the right language, one can create an epic poem even in today's age. ...
      <strong>
       a beautiful poem that falls off the tongue smoothly
      </strong>
      . All through this epic poem, the Poet of the Moon is addressing or discussing the Buddhist concept of
      <em>
       Itai Doshin
      </em>
      or the unity of the mind in the midst of diversity, which is also the concept that underpins the
      <em>
       Ubuntu
      </em>
      philosophy, which translates into 'I am, because we are'. ...In effect the poet wants to see the unity of what he calls 'false dichotomies': science and religion, reason and intuition, material and spiritual, white and black, and others.
      <strong>
      </strong>
      ...
      <strong>
       an excellent piece of poetry.

       Most of the contemporary poets and critics claim that epic is not suitable for our modern age. But Frederick Glaysher has proven them wrong...
      </strong>
      'The Parliament of Poets' has all the grandeur, all the loftiness and qualities which make an 'effort for an epic' a 'true epic.' In essence, 'The Parliament of Poets' is
      <strong>
       a song of unity, an audacious declaration that unity does not mean conformity, it means being in harmony
      </strong>
      . The poet himself is the main character of this epic poem, who travels to the moon, meets a large number of great poets and writers of the world, comes back to earth to have some glimpses of bygone times. Throughout the entire journey, many poets, writers, sages guide the poet and share their invaluable knowledge and insights." —Ratul Pal, Rajshahi, Bangladesh,

      "With his new book, THE PARLIAMENT OF POETS, Frederick
      <strong>
       GLAYSHER is in a creative dialog with the greatest epic poets of all time
      </strong>
      . He is bringing together in beautiful verse form, tending, as he writes 'to the iambic pentameter, depending on thought and need', diverse visions of humanity from all over the world. Frederick Glaysher's poetic imagination is frequently casting them in the form of spatial and cosmic imagery. That is
      <strong>
       very exalting to the reader's spirit
      </strong>
      . What is more, in reading his new book one is not only compassing, beyond the horizon of empirical facts, a borderless world, but one is also beholding the 'oneness' of humankind in a different light. • 'The Parliament of Poets' (Earthrise Press, 2012) by Frederick Glaysher is
      <strong>
       a pure joy; embodied in a literary work of fine verbal art, it is contemporary 'world literature' at its best
