      Our Freelance Services
     </h1>
     <p>
      If you are in need of quality pre-publication services, including proofreading, editing, transcription, book design, and eBook conversion and formatting, you have come to the right place. Compass Rose is a Chicago-based, mom and pop editorial services company with clients all over the world. Please visit our

     <h2>
      Editing and Proofreading
     </h2>
     <p>
      You know what you want to say, you just need help with the 
presentation. Even great writers can have problems with poor or inappropriate word choices; awkward or convoluted sentence structures; or occasional lapses into bad grammar, creative spelling, or incorrect punctuation. Using the spell checker tool included with your software is a terrific start toward creating a client-ready document, but it certainly won’t help you catch everything. For example, it won’t differentiate between
      <em>
       to, too,
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       two; merry, marry,
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       Mary; weather
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       whether; caret, carat,
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       carrot;
      </em>
      or
      <em>
       witch
      </em>
      and
      <em>
       which
      </em>
      . Only a human reader can help you with that! Typos and grammatical errors can discredit your message and spoil your professional image. Mistakes can cost you time, money, and clients. You need a professional editor or proofreader on your side, one whose only job is to look for errors and to make your work shine. Hiring an independent freelance editor has never been more important than in this age of self-publishing. If you do not have an in-house staff to handle your proofreading and editing jobs, our freelance proofreaders and editors can help.

      Manuscript Preparation, Typesetting, and Book Design
     </h2>
     <p>
      Have you written a novel but you’re not sure of the proper format to use when submitting it to a publisher? Do you need a handwritten manuscript typeset into Microsoft® Word? How about a printer-ready book layout for your self-published novel — along with cover design — suitable for either print-on-demand or traditional printing? We can help! We offer a full range of formatting, typesetting, and book design services.

      eBook Conversion, Formatting, Editing, and Design
     </h2>
     <p>
      We believe that eBooks deserve the same care and attention we give to print publications. With this goal in mind, we hand code each eBook individually, instead of relying on conversion software to do the job, and test it on the very devices that will be used to read it, including the Kindle and Nook. We are also able to prepare and format your Microsoft Word document for publication through Smashwords.

      Transcription Services
     </h2>
     <p>
      Compass Rose Horizons provides transcription as a supplementary service for our writers. Our transcription services are designed for the client who only needs the occasional audio file transcribed as part of a project, e.g., 
the doctoral student with a handful of interviews to be included with a dissertation or the family historian who needs an oral history included in a manuscript.
     </p>
     <p>
      We can produce both verbatim and non-verbatim transcripts 
and timecode them if desired. Each and every audio sample is transcribed by a professional transcriptionist and proofread by an experienced editor. You won’t be disappointed!
