       Welcome to the original website of the former Ohio State University Radio Observatory (OSURO), also known as Big Ear. The Observatory was a Kraus-type radio telescope, named for Dr. John D. Kraus, the founder and director of the observatory, who was also the designer and builder of the telescope. Big Ear covered an area larger than three football fields.
The telescope was famous for discovering some of the most distant known
objects in the universe, as well as for the

       In late 1997, after almost 40 years of operation, the Ohio State
University Radio Observatory, with its "Big Ear" radio telescope, ceased
operation. The land on which the observatory was sitting (owned by the
Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio) was sold by them in 1983 to land
developers who later claimed their rights to develop the land. The
telescope was destroyed in early 1998. An adjacent 9-hole golf course was
expanded into 18 holes and about 400 homes were planned for construction
on the nearby land owned by those developers.
       <p>
        This website is meant to serve as a memorial to that unique radio telescope, to its designer and builder (the late Dr. John D. Kraus) and the many persons involved with the telescope, and to the discoveries made with that instrument.

       As was noted above, the Big Ear radio telescope was demolished by land
developers in 1998. The volunteers who had been operating Big Ear prior to
its destruction stayed together as a group following Big Ear's demise
(although with a continual evolution of some people leaving and others
joining). This continuing group has been exploring new possibilities. One of
these is the next generation radio telescope called
       <b>
        "Argus"
       </b>
       , which has the ability to see in all
directions at once.
       <p>
        The group also formed an organization called
        <b>
         "NAAPO"
        </b>
        (North American
AstroPhysical Observatory) for the purposes of developing Argus and other
projects, and the raising of funds for those projects.
