        Once in a very long while, a book comes along that transcends its genre, a book like "The Spy That Came In From the Cold." Such a book is Erika Holzer's new entry, "Freedom Bridge." It started out as a reworking of an earlier book, "Double Crossing," but along the way, it morphed from a Cold War thriller into a blistering historical saga, sizzling with ideas and unforgettable characters and action enough for everyone. Have at it. Pick it up; you won't be able to put it down.”

        “
        <b>
         Compelling!
        </b>
        I just finished reading Erika Holzer's compelling thriller, Freedom Bridge. I could not put it down. I kept saying, "One more chapter, one more chapter-- no, just one more." I cannot remember the last time I read a book in a single sitting.  Holzer's ingenious story of man's quest for freedom is full of deviously clever twists and turns, and is told with such detailed clarity that I had the feeling that she personally witnessed the events she describes. Her characters are drawn in such depth that I felt like she had known them since childhood. Her heroes are truly heroic and her villains are authentically despicable.  I would love to comment on her tear-inducing ending, but it would be a "spoiler," so the readers will have to experience it for themselves.  They won't be disappointed.”

        “This nail-biting anti-Soviet thriller has everything going for it—devious plotting, vivid and multidimensional characterizations, and judicious selectivity. Double Crossing succeeds both as dandy entertainment and a subtle novel of ideas.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “The novel's theme is man's profound need for personal liberty . . . the story of a Russian doctor’s lifelong ambition to flee the Soviet Union. But nothing is quite what it seems in this tense and tangled tale. There are chilling episodes in the shadow of the Berlin Wall, harrowing encounters inside KGB headquarters, moving scenes with hopeless victims of the system, and a bullet-ridden climax at the hem of the Iron Curtain.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Erika Holzer, a romantic, is also a tough-minded realist. She distinguishes between good and evil but lets Kiril Andreyev’s story make her point. If you like spy thrillers or novels of ideas—or if you simply want a realistic portrait of life behind the barbed wire—Double Crossing will haunt you long after its final explosive moment.”

       </p>
       <p>
        “Once in a while, a novel of compelling power thrusts its way to the surface. What lifts Double Crossing far above the standard espionage thriller takes more than crisp storytelling. Holzer dramatizes ideas in a different, near-visceral way as she examines values and conflicting ideologies in each wrenching plot twist and the story builds to a nearly unbearable pressure-point of tension.”

       </p>
       <p>
        “A highly sophisticated plot is presented against a backdrop that captures the typical atmosphere of East-West ‘dialogue,’ with its usual doubletalk, shrewd Soviet intrigues, and pathetic attempts by the West to appease the ever-hungry East. The characters, plot, and background are depicted with such clarity and truthfulness that one can easily see why our world is in such a deplorable state, lost somewhere between physical destruction and spiritual slavery. Most of the people described in the novel are unable to understand their Eastern brothers' passion for freedom . . . as we normally do not appreciate the air until we are deprived of it. The author should be particularly praised for her amazingly accurate description of everyday life in the Soviet bloc countries — remarkable for someone who has never lived there.”
