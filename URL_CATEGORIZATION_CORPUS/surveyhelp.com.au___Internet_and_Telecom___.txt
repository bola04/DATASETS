     History
    </h3>
    <p class="indent">
     SurveyHelp P/L was established in 2007 to service the growing demand and enthusiasm for interviews conducted over the web. The purpose was to provide a one-stop shop for online surveys. In this capacity I have assisted a broad range of local and international clients with many and varied surveys and research projects. Previous to 2007 I worked in the programing and data processing departments of global and boutique research agencies in Sydney. A sum of 13 years experience in the Market &amp; Social Research Industry.
