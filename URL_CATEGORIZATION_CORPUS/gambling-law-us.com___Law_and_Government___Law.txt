          Gaming and gambling in the United States
         </a>
         have undergone a great boom. During the past decade most states have expanded legalized gaming, including regulated casino-style games and lotteries. There has been an explosion in opening Native American casinos.
         <a href="http://www.gamblingsites.org/" target="_blank">
          The 
				popularity of online gambling and betting
         </a>
         has increased exponentially. Gambling-Law-US.com presents, explains and analyzes the patchwork of state and federal and state gambling laws that apply to the boom.
        </p>
        <p>
         The words "gamble" and "gambling" are generally used to discuss an activity that may run  afoul of applicable criminal laws. The word "gaming" is usually reserved for those instances where the activity has been specifically legalized by applicable laws or where the activity is exempted from the criminal laws. Thus, playing a casino-style game at a for-profit website online in the United States is referred to as gambling,
         <a href="http://www.gamblingsites.com/online-gambling-jurisdictions/us/" target="_blank">
          since no state has yet to finalize any 
				gambling law
         </a>
         that specifically authorizes a for-profit website operator to offer any casino games.
        </p>
        <p>
         The two words are not mutually exclusive. That is, a gaming activity could turn out to be gambling where applicable laws regulating that particular gaming are violated. Similarly, a gambling activity may turn out to be gaming if it is exempted from a given criminal statute. For example, playing a card game for money in a purely social setting where no one earns anything from the game other than as a mere player would be gaming if such social games were excluded from the reach of the criminal anti-gambling laws in the state where the game takes place. 
				For the history of gambling laws on a state-by-state basis, see
