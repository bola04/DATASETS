     I'm not a doctor
     <sup>
      <a href="#53018-1">

     </sup>
     , and I don't even play one on TV, but the author of this new book, Nina Shapiro, is both
     <sup>
      <a href="#53018-2">
       2
      </a>
     </sup>
     .  The title of the book is not very revealing, since there's a lot of hype in the world, but its subtitle tells all: "A Doctor's Guide to Medical Myths, Exaggerated Claims and Bad Advice―How to Tell What's Real and What's Not".
    </p>
    <p>
     What is "hype" and why should we care about it?  Here's Shapiro's answer:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     We live in times filled with suspicion: Every day the media delivers swarms of health-related information that can swiftly trigger fear or inspire us to change our habits overnight.  From the headlines about brain-eating amoebas in freshwater lakes to the alleged ills of gluten, sugar, vaccines, foods from genetically modified organisms…, and the chance of getting cancer from tap water, the onslaught of news can be downright overwhelming―and is potentially
     <em>
      harmful
     </em>
     .  One day coffee is good for you and protective against dementia, the next day it's declared a potential carcinogen.  Claims that routinely circulate are frequently overblown, misleading, based on shoddy research or completely false.
     <sup>
      <a href="#53018-3">

      </a>
     </sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Usually, I would not mention here a new book primarily about medical matters, even "medical myths, exaggerated claims and bad advice", but this one appears to be different.  The first four chapters, in particular, deal with the general problem of how to not be hyped, with examples drawn from health and medicine, and much of the advice here ought to generalize to non-medical matters:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       How to use the internet to research:
      </strong>
      <blockquote>
       Unfortunately, many individuals don't know where to turn for unbiased, trustworthy advice, and the ease with which misinformation is propagated on the internet leaves people's heads spinning.  Hence the purpose of this book.
       <sup>
        <a href="#53018-4">

       </sup>
      </blockquote>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       How to understand risk:
      </strong>
      Risk is an area where hype has a detrimental effect, as people often fear minor risks that have gotten big play in the media more than greater ones―such as cigarette smoking or impaired driving―that they take for granted.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Cause vs. correlation:
      </strong>
      What do the words "link" and "association", which you often see in news reports of medical studies, mean?  I constantly hammer on this here, and regular readers are probably sick of hearing about it, as I'm kind of sick of reiterating it.  However, confusion of cause and correlation is one of the most common logical fallacies, and also one of the most damaging, especially when it comes to health.  It's especially common in media reports of medical research, which brings us to the next chapter:
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       How to read medical studies
      </strong>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The remaining chapters discuss particular types of health hype: food; diet; dietary supplements; bottled water; "alternative" medicine; the anti-vaccination movement; medical tests; aging; and exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, I haven't finished reading this book yet, but I certainly intend to do so.

    </h3>
    <p>
     I've mentioned before the old riddle of why white sheep eat more than black sheep
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-2">
       2
      </a>
     </sup>
     .  If you haven't heard it before, think about it for awhile before peeking at this endnote
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-3">
       3
      </a>
     </sup>
     .  Here's an example that reminded me of it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     Figures provided by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration reveal some interesting facts about car accidents.  Of all collisions that occur in the United States, approximately 52% occur within a 5-mile radius of home while an astounding 69% occur within 10 miles.
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-4">
       4
      </a>
     </sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     "Astounding"?  This is a logic check, not a fact check, so I'm going to assume that those figures are correct, and they certainly seem plausible.  In fact, if anything I'm mildly surprised that they're not higher, as opposed to astounded.  Stephen Campbell discusses a similar example:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     The National Safety Council [NSC] informs us that…65 percent of all accidents occur within 25 miles of home.  Using these facts, much public service advertising points out that accidents are not…limited to long trips.  …  What such advertising doesn't tell us, however, is that most driving is done within 25 miles of home….  No wonder there are more accidents under such conditions; there is more opportunity for accidents to occur.  This omission could lead one to misconstrue such well-intentioned advertising and conclude that the wise thing to do is…always make certain you are more than 25 miles from home when driving….  Granted, that would be a pretty dumb conclusion to draw….
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-5">
       5
      </a>
     </sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     An even dumber one, suggested by an accompanying cartoon
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-6">
       6
      </a>
     </sup>
     , is that whenever you're driving within 25 miles of home, you should drive as fast as possible to limit the amount of time you're in this frightening danger zone.  Still dumber is another suggestion I've come across: you should move at least 25 miles away to get out of this dangerous area.  However, the dumbest of all is based on a related statistic: 80% of crashes occur at less than forty MPH
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-7">
       7
      </a>
     </sup>
     , so you should drive over forty at all times, but of course especially when you're within 25 miles of home.
    </p>
    <p>
     The problem with these statistics is that by themselves they tell us nothing about safety, for we need to know how much of our driving takes place within ten miles―or twenty-five miles, or whatever―of home.  If about 70% of driving took place within ten miles of home, that would suggest that distance from home doesn't really affect safety.  In contrast, if three-quarters or more of driving is that close to home, that would indicate that it's actually safer to drive near home than farther away.  Only if significantly less than 70% of one's travel by car were close to home could you conclude that it was less risky to drive far away.
    </p>
    <p>
     To judge the comparative riskiness of driving close to home or far away, what we need to know is not what percentage of accidents take place at these distances, but the
     <em>
      rate
     </em>
     , which would be measured in something like number of accidents per mile
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-8">
       8
      </a>
     </sup>
     driven.  To figure the rate, divide the total number of accidents close and far from home by the total miles driven at those distances.  In this way, the amount of driving done at varying distances would be taken into account in the denominator of the fraction.  By comparing the rates we could determine whether it is riskier driving in our own neighborhood, far from it, or it just doesn't matter.
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-9">
       9
      </a>
     </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
     So, without this other figure to compare, we really can't conclude anything about the safety, or lack of it, of near-home driving.  Despite this fact, the source of the example that I quoted above seems to think the figures it cites require some special explanation.  It claims that drivers have a false sense of security and are more easily distracted while close to home, and that you should be twice as cautious when driving in your own neighborhood
     <sup>
      <a href="#52718-4">
       4
      </a>
     </sup>
     .  However, the statistics cited just don't support these claims.
    </p>
    <p>
     The article concludes with a good point to keep in mind when you get behind the wheel: "Simply being aware dramatically reduces the chance of you being in a car accident, regardless of whether youre just cruising down the street or traveling in another state.

     There is simply no equivalent [to

Overall, politically oriented broadcasting has become a vast echo chamber…, with many tuning in largely to have their views confirmed and to hear the other side vilified.  This is not a scenario that encourages dialogue between those holding different political convictions.

      Review:
     </strong>
     The author of this book is a professor of film and media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the author of previous books, including ones on conservative and religious broadcasting.  Thankfully, the book is well-written and largely free of the theory-laden jargon so common to academic books in this field.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're unfamiliar with
     <cite>
      Firing Line
     </cite>
     , here is how Hendershot describes it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     …Buckley's program was…often a space for liberalism to meet conservatism, for the left wing to meet the right wing.  The result was no-holds-barred, honest intellectual combat, a space that both liberal and conservative viewers could turn to [to] have their ideas confirmed, but also challenged….  You could actually learn about other points of view, and thereby become a
     <em>
      better
     </em>
     liberal or a
     <em>
      better
     </em>
     conservative from watching the show.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
     If you've never seen the show, the book includes several excerpts of some length that can give you an idea of what the argumentation could be like, though there's really no substitute for seeing some episodes
     <sup>
      <a href="#51118-2">

     </sup>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The Preface briefly discusses Buckley's career in the '50s and '60s leading up to the creation of
     <cite>
      Firing Line
     </cite>
     in 1966, including a debate with writer James Baldwin and Buckley's quixotic campaign for mayor of New York City.  The introduction, then, discusses how the show was started, and each subsequent chapter examines the way the show handled specific issues, namely:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Conservatism, especially its position in American politics after Barry Goldwater's humiliating defeat in 1964.
     </li>
     <li>
      Anti-communism, including McCarthyism.
     </li>
     <li>
      The civil rights and black power movements.
     </li>
     <li>
      The women's liberation movement.
      <sup>
       <a href="#51118-3">

     </li>
     <li>
      Richard Nixon's presidency and the Watergate scandal.
     </li>
     <li>
      Ronald Reagan's presidency and the apparent triumph of Buckley's style of conservatism.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     I'm rather nostalgic for a kinder, gentler era of politics when it seemed possible for people of different political persuasions to actually talk to one another.  Nowadays, politics seems so polarized that either people of different ideologies and parties do not communicate at all, or they do so by shrieking and fighting.  However,
     <cite>
      Firing Line
     </cite>
     began its run in 1966, so that its first several years were during the period of the Vietnam war and Watergate.  Political civility was probably at as low an ebb then as it is now, a fact which is reflected in some of the early shows.
    </p>
    <p>
     One lesson of this history is an optimistic one: things may seem bad now, but they've been as bad or worse in the past and matters improved.  The "golden age" of political discourse on television is partly an illusion and partly a product of the changed times.  Thus, there's a basis for hope, even an expectation, that things will improve with time.  Moreover,
     <cite>
      Firing Line
     </cite>
     was always a small oasis of polite political discussion with "exiguous"

     This is a work of history more than a scholarly study of debate, political rhetoric, or argumentation, though there is much in it of interest on those topics.  I'm not an historian, but as far as I can tell the book is historically accurate, though Hendershot has problems with chronology
     <sup>

     .  For example, there is a howler in the following passage concerning "…the 1968 episode with Eldridge Cleaver:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     Now, keep in mind that at this moment Nixon was particularly concerned about PBS liberalism and even had the Corporation for Public Broadcasting defer funding for public affairs programs.  The president was hoping to eliminate white-produced PBS shows that sought to radicalize "the silent majority" of white middle-class Americans.  …  Nixon felt…that there was "no such thing as
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     publicity" where the TV presentation of liberals or radicals was concerned.  So this episode was radical by virtue of even existing at a moment when the president was pulling out all the dirty tricks up his sleeve to limit the broadcasting of radical perspectives.

    <p>
     There are three anachronisms in this passage:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      1968 was an election year and Nixon was only elected president for the first time in November of that year
      <sup>
       <a href="#51118-9">

      , and was not inaugurated until the following January
      <sup>
       <a href="#51118-10">
        10
       </a>
      </sup>
      .  So, Nixon was not even president at the time of the show.
     </li>
     <li>
      <cite>
       Firing Line
      </cite>
      did not move to PBS until 1971
      <sup>
       <a href="#51118-11">
        11
       </a>
      </sup>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      Nixon didn't try to cut off funding for PBS public affairs shows until 1973, according to Hendershot herself
      <sup>
       <a href="#51118-12">

       </a>
      </sup>
      .
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     I think Hendershot was misled here by her enthusiasm for the notion that
     <cite>
      Firing Line
     </cite>
     was good for the left even though Buckley was the most famous representative of the American right during its run.  She does make a solid case that it was one of the few television shows where liberals, and even radicals, could be heard for longer than a soundbite, though I think this was more true in the show's first decade than in its last.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Conclusion, "In Praise of Honest Intellectual Combat", Hendershot recommends―or at least considers the prospects for a reboot of the show with a new host.  I don't know whether this book influenced it, but a new
     <cite>
      Firing Line
     </cite>
     with host Margaret Hoover is scheduled to begin airing next month
     <sup>
      <a href="#51118-13">

     , though I expect that its ratings will also be exiguous.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Recommendation:
     </strong>
     I enjoyed this book immensely, but I wonder whether younger folks who don't remember Buckley or the show will find it as fascinating as I did.  I'm old enough to have lived through the entire run of the show and remember watching some episodes over the years, though I was never a regular viewer and saw only a tiny fraction of the total number of shows.  Perhaps a new audience will be inspired by the new show to take an interest in the history of the old one.  Highly recommended for a select audience, like

     itself.

      Three-Card Monty
     </h3>
     <p>
      'Three-card Monty' is the name; three-card monte is the game!" shouted the dealer to the passing crowd at the county fair.  A young couple paused and looked his way.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Come on now and try your luck," Monty continued, "win a prize with a single buck!"
     </p>
     <p>
      The couple slowly approached his carnival booth.  "Hear me if you want to get paid," Monty said to them, pointing to three playing cards lying face down in a row on the counter in front of him, "to the right of a Queen there lies a Spade."
     </p>
     <p>
      Unlike most three-card monte dealers, Monty did not manipulate the cards.  Instead, he gave verbal clues to their positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      "To win or not to win, that's the rub!" he continued, "to the left of a King there is a Club."
     </p>
     <p>
      The young man, John, took a dollar bill from his wallet and handed it to his companion.
     </p>
     <p>
      "If you want to win, here's the thing: to the right of a Heart there is a King."
     </p>
     <p>
      The young woman, Mary, placed the dollar bill on the counter.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Listen to the final fact," Monty concluded, "to the left of a Heart you'll find 
a Jack.  Are you ready to find the lady?" Monty asked them, "find a gent, you won't win a cent!"
     </p>
     <p>
      Which card should John and Mary pick to win a prize?  Be careful!  When Monty says that a card is to the right or left of another, he doesn't necessarily mean the
      <em>
       immediate
      </em>
      right or left.

       Review:
      </strong>
      True to its model, this is a short, quickly-read book.  The copy I have is a small, pocket-sized paperback that could easily be read within 90 minutes.  It's a basic primer in media literacy, that is, how to tell the difference between real news and "fake" news, false stories, hoaxes, or propaganda masquerading as news.  It's skewed towards political and economic news rather than, say, scientific journalism, presumably because Bartlett's own education and experience is in government and the economy
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-2">
        2
       </a>
      </sup>
      .  Some topics treated are: the difference between primary and secondary sources
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-3">
        3
       </a>
      </sup>
      , the importance of adjusting for inflation
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-4">
        4
       </a>
      </sup>
      , the value of the median as opposed to the mean for averages involving money
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-5">
        5
       </a>
      </sup>
      , and the perils associated with public opinion polling
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-6">
        6
       </a>
      </sup>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite its subtitle, the book seems of two minds about who its intended audience is, as a substantial part is aimed not at citizens but at journalists.  For instance, in the chapter on the problem of "fake" news
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-7">
        7
       </a>
      </sup>
      , Bartlett writes:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      News organizations have responded [to fake news] by setting up fact-checking operations.  …  While fact checking is all to the good, my problem with it is that it shouldn't be considered a separate journalistic function, but rather the core function of all journalism.  If reporters and editors aren't routinely fact checking everything they publish, what the heck are they doing instead?
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-8">
        8
       </a>
      </sup>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      I couldn't agree more, but unless and until reporters and editors stop doing whatever the heck they are doing instead of checking facts, we consumers of the news need the fact-checking sites.  I mentioned earlier this year
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-9">
        9
       </a>
      </sup>
      that there has been a decline in the invisible fact checking once done by magazines and publishers at about the same time as the rise of visible fact checking.  At the risk of committing a
      <em>
       cum hoc
      </em>
      fallacy
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-10">
        10
       </a>
      </sup>
      , perhaps this isn't just a coincidence.  In any case, we consumers need to learn how to fact check what we consume ourselves, which is why we need a book like this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another chapter
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-11">
        11
       </a>
      </sup>
      is primarily a criticism of the unsigned editorials that many newspapers publish.  I don't feel strongly about such editorials, since I don't read them anyway
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-12">
        12
       </a>
      </sup>
      , so I certainly wouldn't be distressed if newspapers were to abandon the practice.  However, this seems more a pet peeve of Bartlett's than something of value to the average newspaper reader.  If you're a citizen just looking for advice on how to avoid fake news, you might as well skip it.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, there is much good information on how to do your own fact checking, especially online, and how not to.  For instance, one issue I've discussed here in the last several years is
      <cite>
       Wikipedia
      </cite>
      .  I agree with Bartlett, who writes: "Wikipedia is a great place to start research and a terrible place to end it"
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-13">
        13
       </a>
      </sup>
      .  He had an interesting experience with it:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      …[M]any years ago I started my own Wikipedia entry with a bit of information about my life and work.  …  But I confess that I have not looked at my entry for a long time.  I once looked at it, found that some inaccuracy had crept in, and attempted to fix it.  A Wikipedia editor asked me for documentation before allowing the change to take effect.  I said the documentation is that I am me and I know that what was written was wrong.  The editor told me that wasn't good enough.  Lacking documentation that I could link to, I gave up my effort to fix my own Wikipedia entry and have not looked at it since.  …  To me, this is a cautionary tale about the risk of relying on Wikipedia.
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-14">
        14
       </a>
      </sup>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      To me, too!  It's also a familiar tale, as I've seen similar stories previously
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-15">
        15
       </a>
      </sup>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Another topic that I've discussed here repeatedly is expertise, its alleged "death"
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-16">
        16
       </a>
      </sup>
      , and how to tell when someone has it.  Bartlett doesn't have a lot to say on the latter subject, except that those who work for universities are more trustworthy than those at think tanks, because the latter tend to be more politicized
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-17">

      .  On the subject of "public experts"―that is, those whose faces we see on television or bylines we read in general-interest periodicals―he writes:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      …[O]ne cannot necessarily trust those anointed as "experts" on cable news or even in quality newspapers to really be experts on the subjects they are talking about.  Even those who at least have degrees in the subjects they opine about may not be up to speed on the latest research, or their area of specialization may be well outside the area they are being quoted on.

      One way that the individual citizen can fight fake news is to resist the temptation to spread it.  Bartlett confesses to having contributed to the problem himself:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      Even when someone is well aware of the fake news problem, the ease and simplicity with which one can repost or forward something interesting that one comes across on the Internet or in an email can overwhelm common sense for a moment, and suddenly you find that you have added to the fake news problem.  I myself am guilty of tweeting such items after reading only the headline of a story that looked interesting―perhaps
      <em>
       too interesting
      </em>
      .

      </sup>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Here's how he suggests resisting the temptation:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      Other than forcing myself to calm down, wait a moment before posting a comment, and reading a story all the way through before acting, I have found that my best defense is the old adage: If something is too good (or outrageous) to be true, it probably is.  That is, try to resist gullibility and credulousness; be skeptical and agnostic until you can determine the truthfulness or validity of some news item, especially if it
      <em>
       confirms something you want to believe
      </em>
      .

       </a>
      </sup>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      This is excellent advice and, if widely adopted, would go a long way to suppress fake news since, as Bartlett discusses
      <sup>
       <a href="#41818-21">
        21
       </a>
      </sup>
      , the fakers are often motivated by the desire to make money or spread political propaganda.  Take away the incentive to fake news, and much of it should disappear.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a book about how to tell the difference between facts and fakery, it's important that it get the facts right.  There aren't a lot of factual claims made in this book, but I'm pleased to say that I discovered only one minor error
      <sup>

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      In the final chapter, "How to Fight Fake News", Bartlett claims that "critical thinking is the best defense against fake news.

      "  This is not really a book on critical thinking, but luckily there are many fine books to follow this one up with

       Recommendation:
      </strong>
      Recommended, especially, for beginners, such as high school students or freshmen in college.  However, it's worth a look even to more advanced readers, since it's a quick read and likely contains unfamiliar research techniques and suggestions.  I learned a few things and I'm certainly no tyro, if I do say so myself.  Like
      <cite>
       Wikipedia
      </cite>
      , it's a useful place to start learning how to do your own fact checking, but don't stop there.  Once you've finished, proceed to a more advanced book, such as David Helfand's
      <cite>
       Survival Guide to the Misinformation Age
