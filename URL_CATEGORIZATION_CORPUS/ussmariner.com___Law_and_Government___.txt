      Mike Leake vs. Eduardo Rodriguez, 4:15pm
     </p>
     <p>
      Another national TV telecast for the M’s who are now in the midst of an actual skid. This is new for them, and while Baltimore looms deliciously coming up, the M’s would love to get a win or two in Boston. The M’s can absolutely make the playoffs without beating the likes of Houston/New York/Boston, but it doesn’t exactly bode well for their chances once they get there.

      Wade LeBlanc vs. Steven Wright, 4:05pm
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, I’m not convinced that momentum is a meaningful thing in baseball. Will the M’s collapse after a painful series sweep in the Bronx? Not likely. It’s easy to dismiss, but then, this whole season seems to have been made out of pure, high tensile-strength momentum. No, the team’s success isn’t due purely to luck, but nearly the entire season has felt miraculous, blessed, guided by baseballing providence.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the team had a living, breathing embodiment of that, divine will cruising lazily along as an 86 MPH heater, it’s Wade LeBlanc. As bad as this last series was for the M’s, Wade’s last start was one of the clear highlights. If anything can snap the M’s out of their little run of bad play (and really, bad timing), it’s Ol’ Wade LeBlanc.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of course, what would be even better would be a return to form from the M’s offense. They haven’t been out and out bad, but the big hits that always seemed to come late haven’t shown up recently.

     <p>
      The clearest sign of the M’s changing fortune? It’s gotta be the fact that SS Jean Segura’s been knocked out of the line-up by an infection in his arm. I mean…what even… of course, if there’s someone whose own reserves of fortune and fortitude can overcome the rather large gap between Segura and Andrew Romine, it’s St. Wade.

      King Felix vs. Jonathan Loaisiga, 4:05pm
     </p>
     <p>
      Happy Felix day. I’m a bit nervous on this happy occasion, as I’d very much like to see the M’s offense shake off some rust and score a bunch of runs, and I don’t want a few series losses to give the Angels a chance to catch up right after the M’s put some distance between themselves and the Halos. I’ll say that any opportunity the M’s give me to feel nervous as opposed to numb and resigned is a gift.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domingo German looked amazing against the M’s last night, and Jeff Sullivan’s got a
      <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/domingo-german-seems-incredibly-talented/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       timely piece
      </a>
      on the details of the run German’s on right now. He looks like he could develop into a very good starter, given his velocity, a solid change-up and a good breaking ball. That repertoire and the Yankees’ light-on-fastballs usage has been remarkably effective against just about everyone the past few years, but what sets them apart is that they seem able to essentially clone pitchers who can do this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Take tonight’s starter, Jonathan Loaisiga. He, too, throws a fastball in the mid/high 90s, has a firm change with a bit more armside run and moderate drop, and then a hard, slurvy curve. Loaisiga’s mechanics mean that his FB has slightly less run than German’s, but everything else looks very similar – the change gets 5″ more run, and the curve’s break is just about identical, too. Loaisiga’s velocity is a touch higher than German’s, which isn’t a great sign. Where do the Yankees get all of these guys? Minor trades and minor free agent signings, as I discussed yesterday. The key, though, seems to be that the Yankees are able to essentially clone their biggest player development success: Luis Severino.
     </p>
     <p>
      Severino throws harder than just about everyone, so he’s got a touch better FB than German/Loaisiga, but the parallels are kind of spooky. Loaisiga’s heater averaged 96.4 MPH in his one start, and had 9.38″ of vertical rise, with about 3″ of armside run. Severino’s has averaged 98.3 MPH (!) this year, with 9.39″ of rise and 4″ of armside run. They both throw a change at 88 MPH, with essentially the same vertical movement; Loaisiga’s gets a touch more run, though that could be a small sample thing. Severino’s breaker is a slider, so it’s firmer and has more horizontal movement than Loaisiga’s slurve, but still – these are very similar pitchers.
     </p>
     <p>
      That’s the key to creating a sustainable, dominant team: replicating player development successes. The M’s turned James Paxton from frustrating, oft-injured, command-plagued enigma into the team’s ace. Imagine if they could do that with other lanky over-the-top-throwing starters they had in the minors? I’d take another 3-4 Paxtons, even if none of them were quite as good as the original.

      2nd round pick Josh Stowers homered in his pro debut last night for Everett, who beat Hillsboro. Arkansas sewed up a playoff spot in the Texas League with a win over NW Arkansas, and Tacoma swept the I-Cubs at Cheney. Everett’s in Vancouver tonight, while Tacoma’s off. Modesto and Clinton had All Star Games in their leagues last night, so they get another night off for their mid-season break.

      The M’s head to the Bronx to take on the formidable Yankees, whose line-up is one of the league’s best. They’ve garnered attention (and envy) by pairing first-round colossus Aaron Judge with trade coup Giancarlo Stanton, all while staying under the luxury tax threshold.  To do *that* they’ve had to piece together a rotation around aging vet CC Sabathia, and that’s gone better than I think anyone would’ve anticipated.

      . Today’s starter, righty Domingo German, was acquired from the Marlins and needed TJ surgery almost immediately. Once healthy, he was throwing in the mid-upper 90s, and has an effective curve and change, allowing him to be successful to both righties and lefties. Formerly a command/control guy, he’s now something of a raw fireballer, with very high K rates, but also high walk and HR rates, which is why he’s a back-of-the-rotation guy for NY – albeit a back of the rotation guy with a K% pushing 30% for his brief MLB career.

      Marco Gonzales is the M’s biggest player development success since James Paxton emerged from Tacoma touching 100 MPH, but it’s a much different kind. He’s *still* much the same as he was out of Gonzaga. He’s not someone who’ll wow scouts with velo, but whose command allows him to avoid loud contact and misses enough bats to succeed in 2018-style baseball. Sure, there’ve been mechanical tweaks along the way, both in Seattle and in St. Louis, but it’s more about making him more successful with his current approach than rethinking the whole package. I think I’ve struggled with the Dipoto regime because I look at the Yankees/Astros models as the ones to emulate – I want a Gerrit Cole and Charlie Morton and Jose Altuve and Luis Severino and Aaron Judge. The whole approach with the M’s seems much more limited, and still, a bit more spotty. Even with lower ambitions, there’ve been missteps (as, to be clear, there have been in New York and Houston as well). Still, with the M’s way up in the wild card and the Angels reeling, you’ve got to hand it to them: it’s worked. Let’s hope it keeps working and that this season just gets even more fun.

      Mike Leake vs. Eduardo Rodriguez, 1:10pm
     </p>
     <p>
      Last night, Wade LeBlanc, the guy the M’s signed off of waivers at the end of spring training, tossed 7 2/3 brilliant innings at one of the top offenses in the league, yielding 2 hits and no runs with *9* strikeouts. If this blog has any sort of purpose (don’t answer that), it would be to help explain a result like that. Sure, we need explanations of the macro phenomenon, with the M’s 21 over .500 and swatting away good teams – even teams that appear to be better in a true-talent sense. But the micro as well: what the hell is Wade LeBlanc, journeyman soft-tosser, *doing* when he frustrates an offense like Boston’s?
     </p>
     <p>
      I know what I’m supposed to do, but here’s the honest truth: I have absolutely no idea. I’m looking at data like it’s going to explain it, and it’s just not. Did he keep the ball out of the center of the zone? No,
      <a href="http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/pfx.php?s_type=2&amp;sp_type=1&amp;year=2018&amp;month=6&amp;day=16&amp;batterX=&amp;pitchSel=453281&amp;game=gid_2018_06_16_bosmlb_seamlb_1/&amp;prevGame=gid_2018_06_16_bosmlb_seamlb_1/&amp;prevDate=616" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       not really
      </a>
      . Different pitch mix? There were a lot more change-ups, but he’s done similar things before, and let’s be honest here: ALL of the pitches, of whatever type, were thrown by Wade LeBlanc, so pure stuff probably isn’t the key to this mystery. Did he have a velo spike? Ha ha ha, nooooo. So, dear readers, I’ve got nothing. He attacked, he showed good command, he refused to give in and walk hitters, and all of that matters. But he does that a lot – there’s precious little to point to and say,
      <em>
       there
      </em>
      , that’s where LeBlanc did something
      <em>
       different
      </em>
      , and that’s what made his night so special.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’ve been thinking about that with regards to the team’s performance overall. They’ve won in different ways, with different players powering them for a week or so at a time. Coming into this series, the story was about their offense, which helped bail out their pitchers who were themselves bludgeoned by Mike Trout. Haniger, Healy and company slugged their way through the Angels bullpen, and that was enough. This series is the inverse of that, where the Red Sox have stymied the M’s offense, only for their pitchers – including Felix and LeBlanc – to toss some of their best games of the year and keep them in it. Both offense and pitching have been a bit above average on the year, but again, the key has been the timing of it all – the pitchers were great in low-scoring games, and the offense stepped up when Trout went all
      <strong>
       Trout
      </strong>
      on the M’s. It’s hard to pick out a signature style or aspect of the game that the M’s dominate at, except their sense of drama and style.
     </p>
     <p>
      But the longer this goes on, the more I keep thinking about something I talked about way back when Dipoto got this GM job and announced from his first few hires what he wanted to do. Dipoto clearly cared about development, and that’s been an aspect of his tenure that I’m still not fully on board with. I still think the M’s minor league player development system isn’t quite firing on all cylinders, but it’s equally true that they haven’t needed it this year. That’s because the other half of Dipoto’s development strategy – seen with the hiring of Andy McKay and Scott Servais – was development *at the big league level.* That was intriguing, and a little less proven. Can you really teach plate discipline or command after a player’s had years of coaching in the minors?
     </p>
     <p>
      As I said at the top, there’s nothing definitive here, but the returns are starting to mount for a cautious “maybe so.” It’s not team-wide; we’ve seen Mike Zunino struggle to maintain the gains he made last year, and Felix has been maddeningly inconsistent. But something’s going on – players in slumps pull out of them and don’t linger on the roster pulling down overall production. Marco Gonzales seems to be *exactly* who Dipoto thought he was going to be in 2017, despite the fact that he spent much of 2017 disappointing. Mike Leake was great in September, surprisingly terrible in April, but has been great since. Dee Gordon hasn’t been great in a while, but let’s not forget the fact that he had to learn to play CF at the big league level – and did it pretty well – before moving back to 2B. This isn’t so much about players blowing projections out of the water, though Mitch Haniger and Jean Segura have certainly done that. It’s about not allowing black holes to develop. It’s those black holes that have sunk so many M’s seasons in the past – those rally-killing spots at the bottom of the order. Ben Gamel looked like he was on the way to becoming one in April, and at other times, Ryon Healy looked like he’d do it too – but neither has.
     </p>
     <p>
      I hadn’t really seen this aspect of the M’s before – it always seemed like players had to leave to really get better: Zunino and Paxton in Tacoma, for example, or Chris Taylor in Los Angeles. They’re not miracle workers or anything, but I’m glad to see this development.

      This is a bit late, but I’ve also been bouncing back and forth between time zones with various levels of service and that seems like a plausible enough excuse. That’s going to continue, by the way, so don’t anticipate me being quick on the reply.  This year the Aquasox have a pretty normal looking roster out of the gate hahaha wow amazing when the draft has already happened. I mean, I dog pretty regularly on the contemporary draft for being less compelling with the drawn-out selection process and the hard caps on pools, but the Mariners were never much to indulge in the first place and we now sign players pretty quickly without that added bargaining room.  That broadly seems appealing, but I also still miss the quirks of the draft-and-follow process.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’m not sure what to think of this staff overall, partly jet lag, admittedly. The outfield core group, I would expect to be the part of the offense that really carries the team and the catching situation will be interesting to see how it settles. I know who’s supposed to be starting in the short term, but there aren’t too many that I’m enthusiastic about and the relief corps probably come out as more experienced and reliable.  Not all of them will be relievers after this year either, although the ones that only recently began pitching probably will stay in the bullpen. The infield…. There are just too many players and most of them are listed as second basemen, because that’s what the draft did for us. Good luck with that, Jose Moreno.

      Wade LeBlanc vs. Steven Wright, 5:15pm
     </p>
     <p>
      A day after another unbelievable comeback, the M’s make their national TV debut for 2018. Fox Sports is televising the game, hence the odd start time. The M’s have been one of the league’s better stories of the year, and part of it is that they seem so perfect for TV – Dee Gordon acting as the hype man, Cruz is the classic slugger, Haniger’s all-around brilliance has included a few made-for-TV defensive plays recently. Add to that the fact that the M’s have played so many close games, and have had innumerable comeback wins, and I’m actually surprised they haven’t had more national games yet.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of that said, viewers tuning in tonight will see a very un-2018 game. With velocity ticking up year after year, pulling the leaguewide K rate with it, today’s game features two starters with the lowest average velocities in the game. Wade LeBlanc’s sinker is over 1.5 standard deviations slower than the league mean, and his four-seam (which he uses sparingly) is over 2 full standard deviations slower. And yet LeBlanc’s the fireballer tonight, as the M’s face Boston knuckleballer Steven Wright and his 76 MPH floater. When Wright does try to sneak a fastball past a batter (something he does around 7% of the time), it comes in around 82-85, or 3 full standard deviations from the mean.
     </p>
     <p>
      Not everything about their game is anachronistic, though. In the past, both Wright and LeBlanc have suffered from problems with the long ball. Wright made only 5 starts last year, giving up 9 dingers in 24 IP. LeBlanc’s last go-round with the M’s saw him yield 14 in 50 innings back in 2016. It’s a warm night, and with two pitchers throwing sub-batting practice speeds, we could see several balls leave the yard. But part of why this match-up is so interesting is that both pitchers are having remarkable seasons avoiding big innings despite those tendencies. Both have incredible strand rates, both are running low BABIPs. Yes, knuckleballers and lefties often DO run low BABIPs, so this isn’t just a “regression is coming” notice. It’s just something to look for – how exactly do they manage to generate weak contact on a consistent basis? Knuckleballs are odd, because you can’t really see anything in their movement data – in general, they don’t have spin, and thus don’t really break. The late movement or fluttering that confounds batters tends to confound efforts to measure them, too. Still, it’s a known unknown; knuckleballs are often very, very difficult to hit (except when they’re not). I simply don’t know what’s going on with Wade LeBlanc. I enjoy it, but I’m baffled it.

       got a great preview of the AquaSox
      </a>
      2018 – take a look. They’ll look to rebound from a down 2017, a year that featured slow starts from a number of international prospects, and then had plenty of turnover as many of those players moved to new clubs following Jerry Dipoto’s midseason trades for David Phelps and others.
     </p>
     <p>
      Their roster features a mix of 2017 and 2018 draft picks and a sprinkling of players who’ve moved up from the Dominican league in the past. Felix’s brother Moises is the pitching coach, and he’ll work with recent draft picks like Joey Gerber, Penn Murfee, Michael Plassmeyer, and Grant Anderson. The position players are highlighted by Keegan McGovern, who’s coming off a huge year for Georgia, and Josh Stowers, the M’s 2nd-round pick out of Louisville.
     </p>
     <p>
      They lost their first game of the year to Hillsboro, 5-2, but they’ll get after it again tonight in Everett with Carlos Hernandez on the hill. It’s Chris Taylor bobblehead night, so you’ll come away with a cool souvenir and bad memories of one of Dipoto’s least effective trades.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tacoma beat Omaha 5-2, with Mike Marjama hitting his 5th HR. Christian Bergman takes the mound tonight for Tacoma, who welcome the Iowa Cubs for a once-every-two-years visit. Manager Pat Listach is on vacation, so hitting coach

      . Why did Listach schedule a vacation during the year? Apparently the Mariners *require* managers to take a four-game vacation once a season, and this is when Listach chose his.
     </p>
     <p>
      Williams Perez tossed 6 sharp innings as Arkansas edged Springfield 3-1. Max Povse starts tonight’s game for the Travelers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stockton blanked Modesto 3-0, who got a solid start from Reggie McClain in a losing effort. The Nuts had just two hits in the game off of Ports starter Dustin Hurlbutt, who’s now thrown 12 scoreless innings against Modesto, giving up just 4 hits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beloit demolished Clinton 9-1, as Oliver Jaskie and Stephen Moyers got hit hard. Ryne Inman takes the mound for the Lumberkings tonight. Inman’s coming off of two mediocre starts; hopefully he can get back to the form he showed in much of May.

      James Paxton vs. Rick Porcello, 7:10pm
     </p>
     <p>
      Last night’s 2-1 loss is the kind that, in other circumstances, would feel bitterly frustrating: the M’s lost despite a strong 7 IP from Felix, they got the first two runners in the 9th on and then squandered them, classic Mariners, right? I don’t know about you, but it felt almost encouraging. If this club gets actual production from Felix, they look less like an overachieving group and more like a solid team that’s playing just a touch over their heads. If they are in the game against the league’s best team, with a former Cy Young winner on the hill, and with the M’s giving the ball to their worst starter (god it sucks writing that), then this team can play with anyone. I mean, we knew that, but given that even great teams will lose 60-70, I don’t feel bad at all about that one going into the loss column. Sure, it’d be nice if the Astros stopped winning, but I’m honestly not as interested in them. The M’s need to hold off the Angels, and that effort’s going swimmingly right now.
     </p>
     <p>
      Big Maple’s going for the M’s tonight, giving them their best odds per Fangraphs/538, and while Rick Porcello’s having a solid year again, I think neutrals would agree that Paxton’s the best starter going tonight. Porcello came up as a sinkerballing ground ball kid with Detroit, and one who had a good amount of success, but who never quite pitched up to his solid #3 peripherals. Boston pretty clearly reworked his entire approach, and while he’s had some serious ups and downs, he turned in a Cy Young campaign two years ago and is again pitching like a good #3 in what’s one of the league’s deepest rotations. Initially, Boston had him throw more of his four-seam fastball, the pitch that made him the most talked-about high school pitcher in the 2007 draft (and whose bonus demands saw him slide down the 1st round). His GB% fell dramatically right as the HR surge was getting underway, leading to a big increase in runs-allowed despite a career high in K rate. 2016 was much, much better, as his HR/FB ration dropped, allowing him to take advantage of his newfound ability to miss bats. He went 22-4 and earned his first Cy Young. Last year was another campaign tanked by HRs and BABIP, followed by 2018 in which those trends reversed, making him look solid again.
     </p>
     <p>
      His K:BB has been pretty stable in Boston, but he’s shifting his approach a bit, using a lot more breaking balls, especially his slider. Interestingly, that increased use of bendy pitches has put a stop to his free-falling GB%, and it’s back up to just over league average after three years below it. Yes, he’s sitting on a career low HR/FB, and so some of this year’s success is luck. But he’s also reducing the number of fly balls allowed in the first place.
     </p>
     <p>
      That last series against the Mike Trouts has put a bit of a damper on the M’s amazing trend towards limiting HRs-allowed, something Boston’s also been quite good at this year. Felix did a brilliant job against the Red Sox’ big three of Mookie Betts, JD Martinez and Andrew Benintendi last night, and that’s something Paxton will have to repeat tonight. The M’s best hitters, Mitch Haniger and Jean Segura, have been worth about 13.5 runs above average this year, which is great before the halfway point of the year. Boston’s big three have all passed the 20 run mark at this point, with Betts the best of the bunch at 30.4.

      As you saw in last night’s game, the M’s made some moves, optioning Dan Vogelbach back to Tacoma, DFA’ing Mike Morin, and calling up RP/SP Rob Whalen and RP Nick Rumbelow, who found his way into a one-run game. Rumbelow pitched for the Yankees in 2015, and did pretty well, then had TJ surgery and a setback and hadn’t pitched competitively this season until this month. He showed the exact same fastball velocity he did back in 2015 – around 93 MPH. He still showed the same secondaries – a change and a slider – but they’ve been transformed a bit. While his FB velo was unchanged, the other pitches were much, much faster. The slider (called a curve at Brooks) was over 4 MPH faster last night, averaging over 85. The change-up was a bit firmer, but it had a bit more downward break. I don’t want to make too much of this, as he only threw two of them, and both were pretty bad, but it’s something to watch for. Dipoto obviously loves the guy, and the M’s used him in a tight ballgame in the 8th, which shows the confidence they have in him. I still don’t see a whole lot that’s noteworthy about the FB, but the change could be interesting in the future. I suppose I should mention that his release point is right smack above the midpoint of the rubber, so he may have less in the way of platoon split issues, but we’ll see. For now, it’s just good to see him out there again now that his neck issue has subsided.

      King Felix vs. David Price, 7:10pm
     </p>
     <p>
      Happy Felix Day. Yes, Felix Days haven’t been the most joyous occasions this year, but everything else about the team is so damn fun that it’s all feels like a big party. Felix has been the rotation’s weakest member, and today he’s up against one of the best teams in baseball – possibly the best. Opposing him is a Cy Young winner. I have no idea how the M’s are supposed to win this, but I now believe that they will. Maybe their 1B who’s sporting a sub-.300 OBP will hit another critical HR. Maybe Mitch Haniger will continue a Troutian hot streak. Maybe it’ll be Mike Zunino. It doesn’t really matter, and that’s the fun part.
     </p>
     <p>
      At different times this year, this team has been carried by frankly unsustainable performances. When those players return to the mortal plane, someone else steps up. This is how they’re able to overcome a month+ cold snap from Dee Gordon, their lead-off hitter who is ALSO sporting a sub-.300 OBP. Because Ben Gamel decided to get off the mat and do that weird .450 BABIP trick for a while. Or Ryon Healy who was AWOL for April, then essentially won the Cleveland road series single-handedly, then fell apart again, and is now a serious power threat again. The fact that it won’t last doesn’t matter – he’s helping the team win, and now we just expect someone else to fill in for him. Maybe Kyle Seager will finally go on a tear. Maybe Nelson Cruz’s hot streak just doesn’t end for another month and a half. Embrace the weirdness, revel in the run differential-flouting timeliness of the M’s in 2018. Have fun.
     </p>
     <p>
      Being an M’s fan has not, historically, offered a surfeit of Fun Times. Certainly in the last 17 years or so they’ve been especially rare. So we’ve got to enjoy this for the crazy, unexpected bounty that it is. It may all blow up, but that’s irrelevant to what we do with this gift we’ve been given. Go Felix, and Go M’s.

      Marco Gonzales vs. Garrett Richards, 1:10pm
     </p>
     <p>
      After two *consecutive* games in which Mike Trout has had multi-homer nights, the M’s go for the sweep today behind Marco Gonzales, one of the league’s hottest starters. I’ve said all I can say about how improbable and bizarre this run is, but The Ringer’s
      <a href="https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2018/6/13/17458024/seattle-mariners-al-west-playoff-odds-team-luck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       Ben Lindbergh has a great post today
      </a>
      on the M’s and how we long-suffering fans deserve a little luck on our side for a change.
     </p>
     <p>
      That post shows how the M’s are faring vis a vis their preseason projections at each position. What’s striking to me about that exercise is that, at least for the position players, the projections *correctly* ID’d 1B as a concern, and has been mostly right about a number of spots. They also saw Jean Segura and Mitch Haniger as above-average players.  Where they missed is just how FAR above-average those two would be. Segura’s absolutely on fire right now, but Haniger’s had both a torrid streak and a cold snap, and I feel we have a pretty good handle on who he is as a player. Those projections undersold his patience and power, and he’s demonstrated both this year. Segura’s BABIP may eventually come down a bit, but he’s both hitting for a touch more power and demonstrating able defense at SS, and thus blowing his own projections out of the water. Those projections accounted for each guy’s potential to collapse – Haniger’s swing-and-miss getting the best of him, or posting a stubbornly low average, and Segura regressing to his 2014-15 nadir. What I think we’re seeing is that their FLOOR was a lot higher than the projections thought; Jean’s simply not the same hitter (or
      <a href="http://sports.mynorthwest.com/469751/how-jean-segura-has-stepped-up-as-a-mariners-leader-with-cano-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       person
      </a>
      ) he was in Milwaukee, and Haniger’s a better all-around hitter than he first came up in the Brewers and D-Backs systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spin-master Garrett Richards dominated the M’s in his first start against them, but the M’s are absolutely magical now, so…uh, good luck with that one, Garrett. Richards K% is over 27% this year, a mark that would easily be a new career high for him. But his control problems that were evident as early as the Cactus League haven’t subsided, so he’s on track to set a career high in BB%, too. Whether its his freakish spin rates or a deceptive delivery, Richards has never shown much in the way of platoon splits.

      Making his debut for the Angels today is 3B David Fletcher, whom you may have heard of through Carson Cistulli’s remarkably effective Fringe Five series at Fangraphs. Prior to this year, Fletcher was a low-power, low-K oddball, someone with good bat-to-ball skills, but without a position that would allow that particular skillset to play. This year, seemingly out of nowhere, he’s hitting for some power. A swing-change guy? No, not really – his fly ball rate is actually down, it’s just that more of them are leaving the yard. Salt Lake City effect? Maybe, though he didn’t show this in half a year there in 2017. We’ll see how he looks now that Zack Cozart’s shifted over to SS as the Angels wait for the return of Andrelton Simmons. In related news, it’s stunning just how different this line-up looks without Simmons, who’d blossomed at the plate for Anaheim. Imagine the M’s without Segura. Yeeesh.
     </p>
     <p>
      The M’s have
      <a href="http://m.mlb.com/sea/roster/transactions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       signed
      </a>
      most of their recent draft picks, including 11th rounder, Damon Casetta-Stubbs. Josh Stowers, Michael Plassmeyer, Jake Anchia, Joey O’Brien, and Joey Gerber are some of the top-10 rounders who’ve inked deals. Still waiting – and probably not for long – on 1st rounder Logan Gilbert, 3rd rounder Cal Raleigh, and the rest.

      The Rainiers welcome Omaha to Tacoma tonight, as the R’s kick off a homestand against the Royals’ affiliate. They were off after their first extra-inning win in Nashville on Monday night.
      <br/>
      Arkansas starts a series in Springfield against the Cardinals. The Travs lost to NW Arkansas last night 7-4, as the Naturals took advantage of a rare off-night from RP Art Warren. One of the batters Warren walked? Former Rainier and Team Italy mainstay Alex Liddi.
      <br/>
      Modesto continues a series in Visalia; the Rawhide destroyed the Nuts last night 11-3. Randy Bell gets the start for Modesto in tonight’s game.
      <br/>
      Clinton got blanked by Astros’ affiliate Quad Cities yesterday 4-0, but the two teams are back at it tonight, with the Lumberkings giving the ball to Clay Chandler to start.
