   A Scientific Journal
  </h2>
  <p>
   As of September, 2016, DMTCS has switched to a new server software
      with the URL
   <a href="https://dmtcs.episciences.org">
    https://dmtcs.episciences.org
   </a>
   . Please refer to that new
	server whenever you may.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you should still have an unsolved business for a manuscript
      that you submitted through our old server interface, please
      contact the editor in charge of your submission directly. We
      have switched to manual for these.
  </p>
  <p>
   All published papers (journal and proceedings) have been
      copied to the new infrastructure, and if you want to create a
      persistent link to your work or the work of somebody else please
      use the new platform. The
   <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/">
    HAL
      infrastructure
   </a>
   on which it is based is a public archive, so
      persistence is warranted.
  </p>
  <p>
   If for some reason you still have to refer to published papers
      with the previous address, you may do so for some time. The link
   <a href="dmtcs-ojs/index.php/dmtcs.1.html">
    https://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/dmtcs.1.html
   </a>
   should still serve all papers statically.
  </p>
  <!-- <p>If your browser supports this, you will be forwarded to the new -->
  <!-- server within 10 seconds. After some initial phase this -->
  <!--   redirection will eventually disappear, so there is no need to -->
  <!--   update your bookmarks.</p> -->
