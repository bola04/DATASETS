       Perfect Pairs refers to a wager in which the first two cards dealt to a hand will be a pair of the same value; for example, a pair of twos, threes, fours, etc. Odds are paid depending on whether the two matching cards are also of the same suit, same color, or are of mixed colors. If the two cards do not form a pair, then the Perfect Pairs wager loses.

       Essential to take note of, is the fact that blackjack rules vary from one casino to the other and this may complicate learning blackjack. The player should check for local variations before playing. However, most correct blackjack rules are so fundamental that they bear no variations in various casinos. Additionally, most large-scale casinos have similar rules, making blackjack a whole lot less complicated. With that, let us delve into a detailed account of basic blackjack equipment and rules.

       Blackjack Switch is a casino game which was invented by Geoff Hall and was later patented in 2009. It is a blackjack variant where two hands, rather than one, are dealt to each playing position. It allows the player to trade cards between two hands, which is otherwise considered a classic cheating maneuver in standard card games.

       This is the oldest form of blackjack and is often referred to as traditional blackjack. The major difference between classic blackjack and other variants is the type of house edge it offers and the fact that you only play with a single deck with the exceptions of a few casinos that offer more options.

       The odds involved in blackjack are whether a player will bust or win his bet. You need to first understand, what hands favor a dealer or the house, a phenomenon known as house edge. This amount is calculated by multiplying the total bets by the amount the casino keeps.The casino always has an advantage over the player because one of the dealer’s cards is facedown and the players have to guess what the value if the card is.

       Two entirely different blackjack variants are known as Pontoon and this can be confusing for players. One can be played at Internet casinos on a number of software including Realtime Gaming, Playtech, Microgaming, Cryptologic and Galewind Software. The other, following the initial rise of its popularity being in England, derives it names from being a British version of the common Blackjack card game.

       Blackjack card counting is the stuff of legend because skilled players have used this practice to make thousands or even millions of dollars.

Obviously it’s hard to replicate this type of success, but that’s not to say it is impossible for you to be a good card counter. If you’re interested in taking up the practice, here are some tips that will help you get started.

       Many of you have probably heard the saying, “Cheaters never prosper.” But there are plenty of blackjack players who are willing to test this thought with various blackjack cheating methods. Most blackjack cheats involve slight of hand tricks, and if your hand isn’t slight enough, you can end up in jail. That’s why the BlackjackLife staff doesn’t recommend blackjack cheating to players. But if you’re still interested, here is a quick look at some of the most common blackjack cheats.

       Blackjack betting systems are quite common since people use them in an effort to win more money with the game. The idea here is not to overcome the house edge (unless you’re card counting), but rather to vary bets in a fashion that will help you come out on top.

       One driving force behind the popularity of online blackjack is that many sites are generous with bonuses. In fact, some players are able to beat the house edge when they combine skilled play with blackjack bonuses. Of course, not every player will achieve this feat because they don’t put much effort into taking advantage of these rewards. But seeing as how you can lose out on a lot of money by not going after blackjack bonuses, it’s definitely worth discussing what you should be looking for here.

       Bill Kaplan and J.P. Massar formed the basis for what would become the most famous card counting team in history – the MIT Blackjack Team. Interestingly enough, the two Americans met at a Chinese restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts of all places. Massar overheard Kaplan talking about blackjack card counting in the restaurant, and walked over to introduce himself, which is where our story begins.

       One of the lesser known skills among blackjack players involves recognizing dealer tells and exploiting them. Now this might sound strange because blackjack isn’t like poker where you’re trying to judge the strength of an opponent’s hand before making moves of your own. Instead, you make decisions based on your score total versus the dealer’s upcard. But with the blackjack dealer tells concept, you look for subtle gestures and cues as to what the dealer’s hole card is. Now that we’ve covered the introduction on this subject, here are some more things you need to know.

       The typical blackjack stereotype is an overweight, middle-aged man with poor fashion tastes and a receding hairline. Erica Shoenberg certainly does not meet this stereotypical view of a blackjack player. In fact, the Akron, Ohio native earned the nickname the “Blackjack Babe” for her good looks and modeling career. But is Schoenberg really a blackjack legend, or just some model who happens to play a little blackjack on the side? Let’s take a look…

       One exciting adaption to the game of blackjack was in 1978, when Las Vegas’ Sahara Casino began running blackjack tournaments. Rather than pitting players against the house, blackjack tournaments start players off with equal chip amounts, and pay out prizes to the top chip earners. If you’re interested in playing some blackjack tournaments in the future, or you already play them, here’s a look at some strategy for these games.

And if you’re already used to using the popular Martingale system, you should have no trouble learning the Paroli.

       Two blackjack legends whose legacies are tied together are Ken Uston and Al Francesco. The main reason why Uston and Francesco are linked is because they played on the same blackjack team together. Now most people would consider Uston the more famous out of these two because he went on to write several major blackjack books, and appeared on TV shows too. But it’s still worth discussing both of these blackjack legends in-depth because many within the blackjack community actually consider Francesco more of a prominent figure.

       One of the biggest things that beginning blackjack players should know is that blackjack rules aren’t always the same in every casino. And this is the case even if you’re playing the exact same game of ’21’ in different casinos. The main reason why casinos change rules is to increase their house edge over the player. With this being the case, it’s really important that you understand how the different rule changes can alter your chances of winning. The following will show the main rules that are changed, and keep in mind that you may find none or all of these rule changes in effect.

       While many blackjack betting systems call on you to make risky and bankroll-threatening decisions at the table, the D’Alembert system is a bit safer choice. The D’Alembert was named after its creator, 18th-century mathematician and physicist Jean le Rond D’Alembert, who theorized that his work could be used to balance out wins and losses over the long-term – though he didn’t entirely mean for this to become a blackjack system. In any case, D’Alembert’s original work is well known for its application in the blackjack world, which definitely makes it worth reviewing.

       When it comes to using questionable tactics to win in blackjack, much of the attention has often been put on the players, who’ve used everything from chip placing to cards in their sleeve to cheat the house. Even card counting is sometimes construed as cheating by novice blackjack players (though it’s not).

       Single deck blackjack has often been looked at as the holy grail of the game because it offers players the best chance to win profits. In fact, the house edge is just 0.15% when players stick to blackjack games with a single deck. With this being the case, you’d think that single deck blackjack is the greatest thing ever. However, there are actually some disadvantages to the subject as well, which is covered below along with single deck blackjack advantages.

       While most famous blackjack players accumulate their wealth on the tables and through books, Kerry Packer is an exception to the norm. Packer built a media empire over his lifetime, and became the richest man in Australia ($A6.5 billion) before his death in 2005. Beyond his extravagant wealth and media empire, the Aussie was known for his high stakes gambling ventures into blackjack, poker, baccarat and other games. Of course, what we’re most interested in here is the blackjack, and how Packer became a legend for his play.

       Blackjack betting systems are commonly used by players to make the game more exciting while attempting to make more profits. The most common system is flat betting, which sees blackjack players make the exact same bet over and over again. Every other type of betting system besides flat betting is either a negative or positive progression. Seeing as how these are the two main types of betting system classifications, let’s take a look at both of them more closely.

Others become blackjack legends because of their theories and contributions to the game. Arnold Snyder is of the latter variety because, while he’s definitely been a successful player, he has found even more success as an author. Since Snyder is such an interesting fellow, let’s dive a little deeper into his life and blackjack contributions.

But even if you don’t like being around a bunch of people while playing blackjack, there are still some advantages you should consider first before refusing to sit down at a table with six other players.

       Russ Hamilton is definitely one of the more interesting figures in blackjack history because he’s both a successful blackjack and poker player. In fact, it was the latter that got Hamilton started playing cards in the first place, and a college professor once told the Detroit native that he’d profit more from poker than school. So Hamilton started playing in underground poker games around the Detroit area, and was very good at it. This prompted him to move to Las Vegas, where a new game caught his attention.

       Those who don’t like to use risky blackjack betting systems like the Parlay or Martingale usually opt for split strategies like the 1-3-2-6 system. At first this sounds pretty complicated because it’s just a string of numbers. However, using this betting strategy isn’t overly-difficult – even for beginning blackjack players. That said, let’s take a closer look at how to use this system.

       While most blackjack legends become famous for card counting, Don Johnson has etched his name into blackjack history by using conventional strategy to win millions of dollars. By his own admissions, Johnson doesn’t count cards, and claims that many players could beat the house if they had the bankroll to do so. Seeing as how Johnson’s theory on blackjack is so interesting, he’s definitely worth looking at closer.

       Few casino games involve the amount of strategy that blackjack does, and it’s important to make as many correct moves as possible to lower the house edge. Of course, it’s virtually impossible to play the game correctly when you subscribe to all of the blackjack myths out there. After all, many blackjack myths revolve around poor strategy moves, and this can cost you a lot of money. So in order to avoid these problems, it’s important to identify the myths and avoid them.

       One seemingly good bet to beginning blackjack players is taking insurance. And a major reason why beginning players are fooled into thinking insurance is a good idea is because dealers ask players beforehand if they want insurance when the opportunity arises. However, this is a very poor wager, and we’ll get into the specifics of why after explaining more about this bet.

       Blackjack is definitely one of the best casino games to play because of its low house edge when proper strategy is used. Assuming you’re on a table with favorable rules and good blackjack strategy is used, you can bring the house edge below 1%.

       Along with the Martingale system, the Parlay system is definitely one of the most extreme blackjack strategies that you can use. The reason why the Parlay is so extreme is because you double bets after every win. This being said, it’s hard to keep your profits when you’re letting winnings ride on every wager. Interestingly enough, this is why they also call the Parlay the “Let It Ride” system too. No matter what you call the Parlay though, it’s a very popular system that’s worth examining closer.
