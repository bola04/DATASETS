        Hi! I just wanted to THANK YOU so much for the awesome job you did on the gift I ordered for my friend's birthday!! She sent me pictures, and I am super impressed with everything you did - from the birthday card and ribbons on the packaging to the selection of munchies and beer - you guys are totally impressive and my friend was so excited about her gift - Thanks again!!! - Joan, Cary NC
       </p>
       <p>
        Just want to say Thank You. The present was perfect. Received nothing but Rave from the recipient. Was this the standard package of beers? The reason I am asking is one was from the local area I sent it to. They were completely excited to see a local company in the basket. Made it look like I went the extra mile with that.  Thanks again!!! - Gerri, Farmington MN

         Mendocino Brewing Company Ukiah, Ca. - Red Tail Ale
        </b>
        <br/>
        While there are some excellent beers born from modern brewing ideas, there's still room in the market for classic beers that stick to the "old world" style of brewing. The Mendocino Brewing Company showed that those traditional standards are still worth keeping around when they introduced their flagship brand known as Red Tail Ale. This handcrafted American-style amber ale is part of the brewery's Legend Collection and is crafted from premium Two-Row malted barley and a proprietary yeast. The brewers add enough hops to ensure a subtle kick of bitterness, but this beer is really all about the interplay of sweet malts.
With a grainy aroma and deep amber to light brown color, this is one brew that you'll want to pour into a glass and serve with any dinner worthy of your fine china. It's also the perfect companion when you're cheering on your favorite sports team or refreshing after a long day.
       </p>

        <b>
         Kona Brewing Company Kailua-Kona, HI - Fire Rock Pale Ale
        </b>
        <br/>
        How do they do craft beer in Hawaii? Find out when you indulge in the sweetness of Fire Rock Pale Ale from the Kona Brewing Company. Your experience will start with the beer's noteworthy copper color, which is dotted with a satisfying amount of carbonation. The white foam rises to a head and then dies back to a thinly laced layer that lingers to the last drop. The aroma has a citrus appeal, but the hops will greet your nose first. If you're a fan of sweet beers that aren't afraid to get creative with the malts, you'll appreciate the blend of premium pale two-row malts, carapils, honey, extra special malt and dark malt. Cascade and Millennium hops join the party to deliver a hoppy finish that balances out that sweet flavor profile. This is a great everyday brew because it's tame enough to play nice with a salad or other light dishes while still holding up to the rich flavors of a more substantial meal.
       </p>

        <b>
         Flying Fish Brewing Company Somerdale, NJ. - American Extra Pale Ale
        </b>
        <br/>
        Baseball fans love American Extra Pale Ale from the Flying Fish Brewing Company, but it's not limited to the ball game. This is an everyday beer that you can pair with a light meal, a heavy dinner, a quick snack with friends or a night cap with someone special. The strong presence of Columbus, Mt. Rainier and Palisades hops is apparent in the intense aroma, but this is a well-balanced beer that allows a blend of four malts to tame that bitter touch once it hits your tongue. Chico yeast is combined with Aromatic, Carafoam, Munich and Two-Row Pale malts to create a mild taste that virtually anyone can appreciate. If you enjoy pouring your beer into a glass and watching the head rise, you may appreciate the golden color of yellow straw with a white layer of foam that can easily expand to a full inch before settling.

        <b>
         Full Sail Brewing Company Hood River, OR. - Amber Ale
        </b>
        <br/>
        The Full Sail Brewing Company set the bar high when they introduced Oregon's first amber ale in 1989. Now marketed under the simple name Amber Ale, this was the first craft beer to get bottled and distributed beyond the local brewery. We're now living in an age where craft beers are shipped around the world to the praise of international enthusiasts, but Full Sail Amber Ale still commands a healthy following with loyal fans. In fact, this is an award-winning dark beer that has claimed more than 20 gold medals. What does it take to win year after year even when pitted against some dynamite dark beers? It takes a strong blend of Chocolate, Two-Row Pale and Crystal malts and enough Cascades and Mt. Hoods hops to create a delicate flavor profile and a smooth consistency. While the malts rise to the front of the line when you first take a sip, the hops are sure to put on a show before you swallow. It takes a bit of spice balanced by the right floral undertones, and it takes a respected brewery with a history of producing winning recipes.

         Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. Chico, Ca. - Torpedo Extra IPA
        </b>
        <br/>
        At the Sierra Nevada Brewery, they refer to Torpedo Extra IPA as their "hop bomb." The brewery is known for creating delicious beers centered on premium-quality hops, and this is one IPA that lives up to that reputation. While many breweries are still focusing on creating the right flavor while treating the aroma as a byproduct, the brewers at Sierra Nevada improved upon the process by creating their dry-hopping machine known as the Hop Torpedo. This machine imparts the perfect hoppy aroma into every batch of brew without altering the bitter taste of the beer. The end result is Torpedo Extra IPA, which greets your nose with an intensely hop aroma and then satisfies your taste buds with a hoppy taste balanced by Two-Row Pale and Caramel malts. Magnum hops are the highlight of this IPA, but Citra and Crystal hops are added for the finishing touch. This beer pairs well with duck and lamb, so make room on the dinner table.

         Santa Fe Brewing Co. Santa Fe, NM. - State Pen Porter
        </b>
        <br/>
        You may not want to spend too much time hanging around the state pen, but the Santa Fe Brewing Company will give you a reason to ponder that lifestyle with this unique beer. Their State Pen Porter is a malty ale that has won six awards, including gold and bronze medals from the World Beer Cup and two "Best of Rockies" designations from the U.S. Beer Tasting Championship. While the chocolate malts really stand out in the aroma as well as flavor, this full-bodied brew is crafted from a combination of Chocolate, Crystal, Carastan and Two-Row Pale malts. Add a hearty dose of Hallertau, Cluster, and Cascade hops, and you're left with a highly drinkable brew with hints of licorice and raisin in the complex flavor. This is a beer that you can add to any dinner table because it stands up well to roasted meats and dishes with intense flavor.

         Anchor Brewing Company, San Francisco, CA. - California Lager
        </b>
        <br/>
        The Anchor Brewing Company brewed their first 
batch of California Lager in 2012 in their San Francisco brewery. The lager made it into bottles a year later and remains 
a popular product for the brewers to this day. What makes this all-malt brew stand out in the marketplace is the intention 
behind the recipe. The brewers wanted to pay homage to the brewing history of California, so they recreated the first lager 
produced in the state. This updated version starts with Two-Row California Barley and adds Cluster hops and a proprietary 
yeast. While this goes against the trend of combining five or more hops and malts to create complex aromas and flavors, each 
bottle of California Lager offers a smooth drink with delicate flavor that is well-balanced. It pours with a golden welcome 
and rises to the top of your glass with a rich, creamy head. This is a simple brew that goes back to the early days of lager 
in California, but it appeals just as well to the modern beer enthusiast and casual drinker.

         Anderson Valley Brewing Company, Boonville, CA. - Boont Amber Ale
        </b>
        <br/>
        Boont Amber Ale comes straight out of 
Boonville, California, and just one sip will show you how well malts and hops can play together. Brewers at the 
Anderson Valley Brewing Company created this drinkable beer to start off with the satisfying flavor of sweet caramel 
malts and end with the bite of spicy hops. The drinking experience starts with a light aroma that hints at toffee and 
fruit with highlights of sun-toasted grain. Lift the glass to your lips, and savor the initial sweetness produced by 
the blend of Crystal and Pale Two-Row malts. The combination of Mr. Hood, Bravo, Northern Brewer and Columbus hops 
finish off each sip with a punch of bitterness that will leave you craving the next drink. When poured into a glass, this 
ale quickly bubbles into a thin white head. As the bubbles disperse, you're left with a non-carbonated Amber Ale that 
goes down smooth. While you may expect a deep red ale to sit a little heavy, this is a light, refreshing beer that will 
help you relax at the end of a long day.

         </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
         The history behind the Shipyard Brewing Company goes back much further than the 1994 opening of the first Shipyard brew pub in 
Portland, Maine. It started years earlier when a young beer enthusiast named Alan Pugsley learned the art of craft brewing in 
England. He studied under a world-renowned teacher at a popular England brewery and then moved to the United States with the dream 
of opening his own brewery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alan was also interested in exploring innovative brewing methods and developing fresh recipes that would challenge the growing 
market of handcrafted beers. He partnered with an entrepreneur named Fred Forsley, and they opened Federal Jack's brew pub in 
Kennebunkport Harbor, Maine. While it didn't bear the Shipyard name, the first batch of brew sold under the Shipyard label was 
crafted in this original brew pub. When the recipe was a hit, Alan and his partner expanded to their Portland Shipyard brewery 
in 1994.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, the Shipyard Brewing Company continues to serve fresh brew from their Portland brewery as well as from Federal Jack's 
in Kennebunkport Harbor. They also bottle and distribute their beers throughout most of the United States, and that growth is 
expected to continue in years to come. This network makes it easy to get your hands on bottled and canned Shipyard beers regardless 
of where you live.
        </p>

         What's on Tap at Shipyard Brewing?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
         Shipyard is known for crafting highly drinkable beers that you can enjoy with a good meal, while rooting for your favorite sports 
team or during a fun celebration. They now offer more than five year-round beers plus a growing collection of seasonal and specialty 
brews. The brewery is known for coming up with creative names that make their beers more fun to drink. For instance, Monkey Fist IPA 
is a deep copper ale that packs an intense punch of hops, and Old Thumper is an Extra Special Ale that was originally crafted by a 
prestigious brewer in England.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the more popular seasonal beers from Shipyard Brewing is called Pumpkinhead. This is a wheat ale that is distributed in cans 
between August and November. This is the season when pumpkin shows up at bakeries and grocery stores everywhere, and beer enthusiasts 
look forward to pumpkin ale just as much as they crave pumpkin spice cookies and cupcakes. The spicy flavor of this craft beer is 
introduced by a strong aroma, creating a pleasurable drinking experience at the end of a chilly fall day.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you enjoy beers that push the boundaries or experiment with new brewing styles, you'll find many options for exploration in the 
Shipyard specialty brew lineup. This collection features beer with unique ingredients and experimental styles, but each flavor is produced 
only in small batches and released for limited periods of time. Shipyard is devoted to training young brewers in experimental methods 
so that they can continue challenging the market and introducing new flavors and mouthfeels for beer enthusiasts.

         A Commitment to Quality
        </strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
         What makes the Shipyard Brewing Company different from many beer companies now shipping product around the United States? The Brewers 
are committed to crafting beers from only the finest quality ingredients. They use fresh, carefully-sourced hops, malts, yeasts and water 
even when other breweries may cut corners in order to increase their profit margins. When you pour a glass of Shipyard, you know that the 
all-natural ingredients are going to make a great impression on your taste buds.

         <h4>
          Marble Brewery
         </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
         Marble is the perfect example of a regional brewery content with serving local fans. While they have yet to expand across the 
United States or start shipping their craft beers to other countries like many other breweries, they have developed an enviable 
following throughout the northwestern corner of the U.S. It all started in 2008 when the first Marble brew pub was opened in downtown 
Albuquerque with the intention of creating bold flavors and sparking more innovation in the New Mexico craft beer industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         The brewery quickly became popular throughout the state. Fans visiting the brewery appreciated the intense flavors of the unique 
beers served in the pub, and they enjoyed the customer-focused, friendly vibe of the brewery. The brewers aimed to raise expectations 
so that their fans expected and received more each time they visited. It wasn't long before the brewery was ready to expand, and there 
are now three Albuquerque Marble brew pubs in operation.
        </p>
        <strong>
         The Marble Experience
        </strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
         The best way to get your hands on a tall glass of Marble beer is to pay a visit to one of the brew pubs in New Mexico. Most of the 
pubs are open at until 11 pm or midnight most nights of the week, and the Brewers coordinate with local businesses to create interesting 
experiences throughout the year. In addition to filling your glass with fresh beer straight from the tap, you may enjoy fresh food provided 
by a local restaurant or a selection of New Mexico food trucks.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Marble Brewery is also known for hosting community events and charity fundraisers at select times of the year. You may catch 
musicians performing live or participate in interactive shows if you visit at the right time. You can check their website to see what 
events they may hold during your trip to Albuquerque, or just stop in and see what's happening. If you visit the downtown location on 
a Saturday afternoon, you can even take a tour of the brewery to learn more about the company and the craft brewing process.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you can't make it to Albuquerque, you can find Marble beers throughout the state as well as in select areas of Colorado and 
Arizona. You may also find it in beer gift baskets or other products offered by some online vendors. While this is a smaller brewery 
that serves a regional market today, they continue to grow in popularity and may expand their horizons in years to come.
        </p>
        <strong>
         The Marble Beer Collection
        </strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
         The Marble Brewery doesn't offer an expansive collection of brew, but what they do offer is exceptional in quality. They offer 
a growing list of classic beers that are sold year-round, and then there are special brews that they distribute for shorter periods 
of time. The classic lineup offers a variety of beer styles, including a pilsner, an IPA, a double white, a red ale, an oatmeal 
stout and a wildflower wheat. While they can't compete in volume with breweries that produce a long list of ales, they do offer 
intense flavors and quality ingredients that are appreciated by beer enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most popular beer from Marble is likely their Pilsner. This beer has received gold and bronze medals from the World Beer 
Cup and three medals from the American Beer Festival. It was brewed to represent a classic German beer and pours into the glass 
a light golden color with a tall head of creamy white foam. It has a well-balanced flavor profile with German Pilsner malts and 
a combination of Tettnang, Hersbrucker and Magnum hops.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether you try the Pilsner on tap at one of the Marble brew pubs or find a new way to get your hands on a few bottles of 
Marble's best brews, you can feel good that you're helping a customer-driven brewery give back to their local community. Marble 
contributes to local charities every year, giving thousands of dollars to help those in need. Drink up in the spirit of giving back.
