              to improve your poker skills. While poker hand calculations don't assure you'll win any given hand, they help you win more hands over time. Know the chances you'll win or lose a hand lets you pick your spots better, gives you assurance when you raise the pot, and tells you the best time to bluff. We provide explanations of what to look for when building flushes and straights, along with handy formulas for calculating your pot odds.

              Guide to Value Betting
             </h3>
             <p>
              Winning players are good at value betting.
              <a href="https://www.tightpoker.com/value-betting.html">
               Mastering the art of value betting
              </a>
              takes two skills: putting your opponent on a hand and making a bet that extracts the most cash from your opponent. After thousands of poker hands, a player should be able to put their opponent on a hand -- to know what cards the other player is holding. This comes from an understanding of the cards left in the deck, knowledge of their opponent's tendencies, and an insight into the kind of hands an opponent likely would play. Value betting involves raising when you have a stronger hand than your opponent. At that point, it's a matter of figuring out how much to bet to keep your opponent in the hand long enough to dump a lot of chips your way. It's not easy, but Tight Poker's strategy guides teach the tips and tactics you need to master value betting.

             <p>
              Tight Poker devotes a lot of time to helping players
              <a href="https://www.tightpoker.com/best-us-poker-sites-for-usa-players/">
               find the right online poker site
              </a>
              for their needs. The Internet is full of online cardrooms: some good,
              <a href="https://www.tightpoker.com/rogue/">
               some bad
              </a>
              , and some world class. Players in different countries have different site choices, so not everyone can simply gravitate to the best poker rooms. Each player has different wants and needs and different technical requirements. Tight Poker provides reviews and comparisons of the many online poker sites available. We give recommendations, but we also provide the tips and tools you need to make decisions on your own.

Maybe you like turbo events. Perhaps you prefer the big weekend guaranteed events with the biggest prize pools. Maybe you like satellite events that feed into live tournaments. Maybe you prefer cash games and don't want to deal with online poker tournaments at all. Or maybe you want to find the biggest bonuses and best VIP rewards programs. Read through our many site reviews to narrow down the options, then pick the poker room which best fills your needs.

              What Poker Security Features You Need
             </h3>
             <p>
              Site security often is overlooked by new card players. It hardly matters if you win or lose, if someone steals your personal information during or after your poker sessions. Tight Poker concerns itself with finding the online card sites with the tightest security. Most need to use 128-bit SSL encryption to ensure the security of your payments, but it goes beyond that. Site staff needs to be careful, helpful, and willing to go the extra mile to assure the safety of your poker account. We list blacklisted and rogue sites, while explaining what both terms mean. This helps you avoid the worst offenders, so you have a positive online card playing experience.
