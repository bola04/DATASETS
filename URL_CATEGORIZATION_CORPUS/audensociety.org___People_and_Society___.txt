    <em>
     A warning to potential buyers of Auden memorabilia:
    </em>
   </strong>
   Three items in Auden's handwriting were offered for sale on eBay in March 2009; 
two of them are not exactly what the auction listings describe them as being, 
and potential bidders should beware. The item described as "Very 
rare authentic W. H. Auden handwritten poem" is not a poem at all, but a 
partial pencil draft of the index of the first lines of the poems that Auden 
selected for inclusion in an anthology,
   <em>
    The Faber Book of Modern American 
Verse
   </em>
   , published in 1956; every line is the first line of one of the poems 
in the anthology, all written by other poets. The item described as "Authentic 
W. H. Auden handwritten Polish Ballet notes" is a printed programme booklet 
with notes
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   written by Auden, but someone else who has not been 
identified; the lot also includes a three-by-five-inch index card with notes 
that are, however, in Auden's hand; the notes are a brief list of poems by the 
American poet William Vaughn Moody, evidently listed for possible inclusion in 
the same
   <em>
    Faber Book of Modern American Verse
   </em>
   . The item described as "Authentic 
W. H. Auden Driver's License" is, however, accurately described, and is 
evidently Auden's driver's license, apparently issued in December 1968.

    <span style="font-style: italic">
     News that wasn't:
    </span>
   </strong>
   The London newspaper
   <em>
    The 
Independent
   </em>
   splashed across its front page on 5 September 2007 the news 
that three "lost" schoolboy poems by Auden had been rediscovered. These three 
unsigned poems were in fact known to researchers for many decades, and there 
seem to be no convincing reason to believe that Auden wrote any of them. It is 
of course not impossible that Auden was the author, but they could equally well 
have been written by almost any literate schoolboy of the period. Katherine 
Bucknell, the editor of Auden's
   <em>
    Juvenilia,
   </em>
   has argued in the Society's
   <em>
    Newsletter
   </em>
   that one of the poems was written by Auden's friend Robert 
Medley. Probably no one will ever know who actually wrote these poems, and, as 
Auden wrote in "Archaeology," "guessing is always / more fun than knowing."

    A note on Reinaldo 
Javier Sanchez from Venezuela:
   </span>
   The Society recently received an e-mail from Reinaldo 
Javier Sanchez, who describes himself as a professor of English at a university 
in Venezuela, asking for a copy of Auden's
   <span style="font-style: italic">
    Collected Poems
   </span>
   to sent to him by air mail;
   <span style="font-style: italic">
   </span>
   he writes that he needs 
it for a project that he has planned for his students. If other webmasters 
should receive a similar request, they may wish to read some earlier messages 
written by Prof. Javier Sanchez. Examples of such messages may be found
   <a href="http://guestbook.sparklit.com/entries?gbaction=viewResponses&amp;gbID=118430">

   and

   , 
and further messages from Prof. Javier Sanchez - who evidently teaches a wide range of 
subjects, is deeply committed to his 
students, is sometimes male and sometimes female, and has remained 25 years old 
from at least 2004 through 2009 - may be found through a web search. For some unknown reason, Prof. 
Javier Sanchez's name does not appear in the
   <a href="http://www.unellez.edu.ve/unellez/index.php?pagina=directorio&amp;aqui=1" target="_blank">
    directory of the university
