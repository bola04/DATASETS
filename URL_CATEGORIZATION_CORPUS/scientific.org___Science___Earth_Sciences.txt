      Governor Commutes Lovitt's Death Sentence (Nov.
      29th)
     </p>
     <p>
      Virginia Governor Mark Warner issued a
      <a href="archive/Press-release-Lovitt-commutation.htm">
       press
      release
      </a>
      today announcing that he would commute Robin Lovitt's death
      sentence to life imprisonment.  The announcement came one day before
      Lovitt's scheduled execution.  Warner cited the improper destruction
      of biological evidence by a court official, which prevented a
      post-conviction DNA re-test, as the reason for his decision, saying
      "[t]
      <font size="2">
       he Commonwealth must ensure that every time this
      ultimate sanction is carried out, it is done fairly".
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      One would hope, of course, that every time a life sentence is carried
      out it is also "done fairly."  If Lovitt's conviction was
      unfair, the appropriate remedy is a new trial, not a reduction in
      sentence.  An unfair legal process that leads to a life sentence is
      less offensive than one that leads to an execution, but it is still
      offensive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governor's press release did not address the claim that Lovitt
      received an unfair trial on the issue of guilt or innocence due to biased
      and misleading testimony about "inconclusive" DNA tests.  (
      <a href="DNAProblems/DNA-Problems.htm#Virginia refuses">
       Click
      here for background on that claim)
      </a>
      .  Whether he lives of dies,
      Lovitt's case will continue to be an excellent illustration of the failure
      of the justice system, at both the trial and appellate level, to deal
      effectively with problematic scientific testimony.

      Lovitt Scheduled for Execution Nov. 30th (Nov.
      27)
     </p>
     <p>
      Barring a last minute reprieve from Virginia Governor Mark Warner,
      Robin Lovitt will be executed Nov. 30, 2005.  Lovitt arguably did not
      receive a fair trial because the DNA evidence in his case was presented to
      the jury in a biased an misleading manner.  Yet the basic unfairness
      of the scientific testimony was never articulated clearly, nor raised as a
      significant issue, at any point of the appellate process.  The case
      illustrates the failure of the justice system at both the trial and
      appellate level to deal effectively with problems in scientific
      testimony.

       Va. v. Winston
      </i>
      (Nov. 27)
     </p>
     <p>
      As an additional example of shoddy DNA testing by the Virginia Division
      of Forensic Sciences, we have posted transcripts, lab reports and lab
      notes from another capital case--
      <a href="DNAProblems/DNA-Problems.htm#Winston">
       <i>
        Virginia v. Leon Winston
       </i>
       .
      </a>
      Not only did analyst Nicole Harold mischaracterize the statistical value
      of the DNA match, she violated her lab's protocol by ignoring the failure
      of two scientific controls (called "random sample controls")
      that were designed to determine whether the test procedure was working
      properly.   These controls (random samples from the Virginia
      state offender database) were run at the same time as other samples in the
      Winston case.  One "random control" produced an incomplete
      profile, the other produced the wrong profile.  Yet Harold reported
      the results anyway.  Her lab reports, issued in 2002, made no mention
      of the control problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interestingly, the Virginia Division of Forensic Sciences decided to
      stop running random sample controls as of January 11, 2005.  The
      <a href="archive/Winston/Random%20control%20ban.pdf" target="_blank">
       memo
      announcing that these controls should be discontinued
      </a>
      "in order to
      improve turnaround time for the analysis of casework" was signed by
      Jaffrey Ban, Forensic Biology Section Chief.  Ban was relieved of his
      duties as Technical Leader of the Virginia Division of Forensic Sciences
      DNA laboratories in May 2005, after an ASCLD-LAB Audit Report (dated April
      9, 2005) faulted him for errors and misinterpretation of DNA testing in
      the Earl Washington case.
