     A special note regarding viruses:
     <br/>
     <p>
      We have received inquiries from some of you regarding viruses that you 
        think may have come from us, and from others who believe they have been 
        put on a mailing list (although we have no mailing list). 
        Therefore, it will be worth your time to read this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Clarifying Christianity has become a very popular website, and our URL 
        and various email links are stored in many of your browser caches. Some 
        viruses will scan your computers Internet browser cache and look 
        in the files for email addresses to which they can spread themselves. 
        When these programs find something to send to, they will use the email 
        addresses in your browser cache to fake sender IDs and scan HTML files 
        for pieces of text to use as the subject line. This allows the virus-infested 
        emails to masquerade their true senders, so they look instead like emails 
        from friends of yours (or you)something you are likely to openallowing 
        the virus to spread further.
     </p>
     <p>
      We get a large number of these virus mailings, and it would help us (and 
        everyone else) if you can take some time and scan your computer for viruses. Of 
        course, having the latest updated virus descriptions in your computer 
        is also necessary.
