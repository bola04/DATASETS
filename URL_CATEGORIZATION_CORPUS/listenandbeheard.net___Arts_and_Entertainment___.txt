          As new parents you find yourself running all over the house looking after your small child, but there is actually a better way to run and it is something that your little one will actually enjoy. Jogging strollers are a terrific way to get yourself back into shape after having a child and it is something that more parents are starting to get into. There are a number of benefits to using one of these. You can stay fit, get out of the house, take your children with you and save on babysitting, expose them to the outside world and give them a fun adventure that they will look forward to every day, and reduce your stress by getting some well deserved exercise. While these types of strollers are an added expense and can get quite pricey, they are also well worth the investment.
         </p>
         <p>
          The right equipment always makes a huge difference, and one of the top makers renowned for their jogging strollers is BOB. They make some of the most durable models that are perfect for rough or easy terrain. They are safe, reliable, easy to store, and provide a comfortable ride for kids of just about any size. If you wish to get the
          <a href="http://www.marathon-training.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
           best jogging stroller
          </a>
          available that can take a lot of wear and tear then any of the options in the BOB line of joggers would be an excellent choice. Below are just three of their top rated strollers and why they are so loved by active parents around the globe.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Revolution Flex
         </h3>
         <p>
          There are several unique and exciting features that set the BOB Revolution Flex apart. One thing to keep in mind is your height and the height of everyone who might be jogging with the full stroller. Because of that you will enjoy the benefit of this advanced stroller designed specifically for jogging. One great feature to give you an idea of the thought that went into this option is an adjustable nine-position handle bar. The key to relaxing while jogging is keeping your elbows in and relaxing the shoulders. This is exactly where the idea for this great feature comes from. You’ll still need to use the stroller unless you are planning to jog around the house and in store. Because of that you’ll enjoy using the feature that allows the front wheel to lock forward and swivel for both uses. Just like your favorite running shoes.
         </p>
         <h3>
          BOB Revolution SE
         </h3>
         <p>
          Just like on a car or even your favorite running shoes, cushion matters. In picking anything with wheels you’ll need first to understand that the only cushion you will have is the tires that separate the construction from the road. Just like off-road tires the bigger you inflate the tires the more surfaces you can comfortably travel across. With that in mind take a look at the BOB Revolution SE. Boasting large tires that are inflatable you will notice the difference when you jog with it. The difference you may have experienced is the hard plastic molded tires or other material like on a shopping cart. You feel everything. Like a car with bad shocks. In contrast to be useful inflatable tires will make the ride not only more comfortable but more stable. This is a great option to find that. Another option for convenience of use is the benefit of being collapsible to fit on buses, in trunks, or backseats.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Revolution Pro
         </h3>
         <p>
          With the BOB Revolution Pro you will also benefit from the convenient easy adjust handlebar. What are you gonna need on the jog? What weather are you gonna be jogging in? How long are you going to be out? What type of snacks does your passenger need? What type of snacks do you need? The reason I point this out is because you don’t want to get stuck without adequate storage. Jogging with a backpack can be rough and with the BOB Revolution Pro it can be avoided. This model boasts ample storage room. But the thing to consider is that the heavier you load the stroller the more you need to consider how you will stop it. Especially jogging down hill. The way this model solves that issue is with as a brake that is hand activated like on a mountain bike. This stroller is also solid which makes it more comfortable for your passenger and more durable and desirable for repeated use.
         </p>
         <p>
          BOB has an extensive line of strollers designed for active parents and these are just three of our favorites, especially if you like to go off road. We cannot say enough good things about these joggers, and our experience with them has been nothing short of spectacular.

          If you do not like the taste of microwaved food but you are also not fond of all of the hassle involved with using your full sized range, then getting a toaster oven can be a perfect solution. For years they have gotten a bad name and have usually just had a reputation for making toast or heating up frozen dinners. However, the modern toaster oven has evolved into a high tech machine that you can use to truly create some of the best tasting meals that may just surprise you and your family.
         </p>
         <p>
          Gone are the days of hot spots and burnt toast. Today they come with features like convection heating to produce an evenly cooked result that is both juicy and tender. From side dishes to the main course, there are literally loads of
          <a href="http://thestir.cafemom.com/food_party/186559/10_toaster_oven_meals_made">
           recipes suited for a toaster oven
          </a>
          . With that mind we are going to focus on some of the best performers that are geared towards those that need a full sized oven replacement. If you love to prepare home cooked meals then these are the models that you should be considering.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Breville Ovens
         </h2>
         <p>
          For the best of the best you cannot go wrong with a Breville. They have a stellar reputation for their modern small appliances and their entire line of small ovens are superb. The BOV800XL has been the best rated oven for a number of years but it has recently gotten an update. Breville has made some minor improvements and additions and have introduced the BOV845BSS. This is perhaps the top rated oven out there and it has many premium features that owners have fallen in love with in their kitchen.
         </p>
         <p>
          Besides its sharp and sleek looks, this oven has some high-end cooking features that set it apart. Convection cooking, quartz heating elements, an easy to learn and use LCD display, 10 preset functions, and a front accessible crumb tray are just some of the aspects of the BOV845BSS that we love. We actually have one of these in our own kitchen and can attest to its prowess. Everything comes out remarkably perfect without little interaction from the user. From ribs to roasts, this oven does an excellent job when it comes to cooking meat as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is pricey, but oh so worth it. This is probably going to be the most expensive option, but it is truly a top performing oven that we highly recommend. It gets fantastic user ratings as well, so we are not the only one singing its praises.
         </p>

         </h2>
         <p>
          <img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-26" height="244" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" src="http://www.listenandbeheard.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cuisinart-oven.jpg" srcset="http://www.listenandbeheard.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cuisinart-oven.jpg 489w, http://www.listenandbeheard.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cuisinart-oven-300x168.jpg 300w" width="435"/>
          Cuisinart is another brand name that carries with it an excellent reputation. While they have a sturdy line of ovens that vary across different price points, their TOB-260 is their best effort to compete with Breville ovens. This is most apparent when looking at both of them side by side. They both have stainless steel housings and LCD displays, but Cuisinart tries to add a little more for a little less.
         </p>
         <p>
          The TOB-260N has not one, but two different convection features to ensure that your food comes out delicious and evenly cooked. One of the great things about this feature is that it will also end up reducing your cooking times. This added convenience is one of the main reasons why convection cooking is starting to catch on.
         </p>
         <p>
          It also has a host of preset cooking functions as well as Cuisinart’s Exact Heat system to ensure that your food is done right. No hot or cold spots. This oven is a little cheaper than the top Breville offering, but it is still not going to be cheap. With a huge interior for a countertop oven, this model is an excellent option for those with a lot of mouths to feed. We really like this toaster oven and the

           review of the TOB-260N1
          </a>
          shows just how well it has been received in kitchens across the world.

         <h3>
          The Rest
         </h3>
         <p>
          Honestly, the two models above are going to be your best top-end options. These are for serious chefs that love to spend a ton of time in the kitchen cooking for the family. There are some worthy ovens from KitchenAid and Oster that will let you save a little money, but they also have their drawbacks that keep them from measuring up with Cuisinart and Breville. If you have the money to spend, then they are your best choices for countertop convection workhorses. While you cannot go wrong with either one, we give a slight edge to the Breville BOV845BSS for its feature set, durability, and performance.

          Toaster ovens are extremely versatile appliances that unfortunately do not get taken full advantages of by a number of owners. They are extremely quick and efficient at many of the cooking jobs that most people use their full sized ovens for, yet they get seldom used as they were intended. If you love to spend time in the kitchen and prepare tasty treats for yourself or your family, then let’s give your countertop oven a workout and explore what it can truly accomplish for you.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Baking
         </h3>
         <p>
          This is where you can really get a lot of use out of a smaller oven, especially if you own a convection toaster oven. While some ovens do come with a few pans as accessories, it is a good idea to purchase some separate bakeware to truly take full advantage. Muffing pans, cooking pans and any other type of specialty pan should let you create some extraordinary baked goods in your oven. Convection ovens circulate the air inside while operating which especially good for baking. This will ensure that your food is evenly done on all sides without burning or soft spots.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Cooking
         </h3>
         <p>
          Just about any type of recipe that calls for the use of an oven can be done in a toaster oven. Modern machines are able to roast, broil, bake, and cook just about any type of meal with exceptional results. Today’s higher end toaster ovens come with settings for each of these different functions so it is as easy as pushing a button. They can also automatically adjust the temperature and cooking time depending on the food that is being cooked. You do not have to limit yourself to preparing only toast in a toaster oven, so get cooking.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Reheating
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you do not like how your food tastes after you try and reheat it in a microwave then you should pop in your countertop oven. Most machines have a reheating setting and they usually perform remarkably well. The smaller size of the oven requires less time to heat so it should be done in a snap. You can also reheat multiple items at once. Frozen pizza, leftovers, or even soup can all be brought up to a warm to hot temp without cooking it further. Toaster ovens are a great way to reheat items quickly.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Defrosting
         </h3>
         <p>
          The same thing that applies for reheating food also applies to defrosting frozen food. Microwaves can actually over heat certain spots while trying to defrost and you will end up cooking the outside in certain areas. This can be avoided with a toaster oven as modern models usually have a fully functional defrost setting that lets you thaw out frozen meat without cooking it.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Making Use Of The Convection Setting
         </h3>
         <p>
          If you have a convection toaster oven then you are truly in luck. These types of ovens can really help you speed up the cooking process without sacrificing taste. Not only will food get done faster, but you usually can use lower temps and less energy. The only downside of cooking with convection is that you will have to
          <a href="http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/articles/detail/convection-cooking-adjustments">
           adjust your cooking times
          </a>
          , generally by 20% to 25%. This will take some experimenting, but once you get it down, you will not want to cook your food any other way.
         </p>
         <p>
          Cuisinart, Breville, and Kitchenaid all make fantastic ovens with convection features and these are the brands we would typically recommend for those who spend a lot of time in the kitchen. We purchased a Breville BOV845BSS after seeing that it was ranked as the
          <a href="http://www.greatplainsexaminer.com/best-toaster-ovens/">
           best overall rated toaster oven
          </a>
          that you can buy. Cuisinart and Kitchenain make comparable ovens, but we have been extremely satisfied with our “Smart” oven and we really give the convection functionality a workout.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Some Practical Tips
         </h2>
         <p>
          Once you get a toaster oven there are some small things that you can keep an eye on to prevent some unwanted hassles.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Clean Your Oven
         </h3>
         <p>
          Most of today’s oven are made with non-stick materials with stainless steel bodies. It is important to wipe them down once they have cooled. Pay close attention to the crumb trays and make sure that you remove any grease that may have dripped down. Grease build up may be ignite in extreme cases and you will wind up burning your food. Simply remove it when you are done cooking and rinse it out over the sink. This routine will save you a lot of trouble in the long run.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Don’t Over Stuff
         </h3>
         <p>
          The more centered your food is in the oven, typically the better results you will have. If you try to stuff to many items into the oven then some of the food on the out edges or corners may not get all the way done. This goes for anything from bread to cookies. Give your food some room.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Oven Lovin’
         </h3>
         <p>
          Most folks are hesitant to try something new, but if you already own a toaster oven then by all means feel free to experiment with it. Once you discover everything that you can prepare in one of these small appliances the more you will kick yourself for not taking full advantage of it sooner. If you do not own one of these ovens yet for your counter then we suggest finding some of the latest reviews. Consider stepping up your game in the kitchen and get something that is going to save you time, energy, and money in your home while still delivering mouth watering results that your family will love.

         <p>
          If you love juicing fresh fruits and vegetables, and you’re in the market for a new juicer that can help you get the job done efficiently, then you should consider masticating juicers. They are equipped with an auger which helps them to break down different foods more thoroughly than centrifugal juicers. They take a bit longer to crash foods, but that slow process is very effective in preserving maximum amount of essential nutrients and enzymes from leafy greens and other foods.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the top masticating juicers you can buy is the Omega J8006 Nutrition Center Juicer. It has been around for a few years, but it is still a best seller that continues to rank high with users and get impressive scores. If you have been reading current vegetable juicer reviews you would have seen that the J8006 is still regarded as one of the best juice extractors for the money.
         </p>
         <p>
          This quiet juicer outperforms other more expensive masticating juicers in delivering high-quality juice from fruits and vegetables without destroying their flavor or nutrients. It’s powerful enough to handle a wide variety of veggies from spinach, carrots to wheatgrass and kale. It’s also very versatile, and can be used to grind coffee, make pasta, nut butters, as well as mince herbs and spices. And that’s not all, it comes with a 15 year warranty.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can find the latest reviews of all the

           top rated Omega juicing machines
          </a>
          and see for yourself where the J8006 stands. It may seem kind of basic compared to their newest models, but this is still a great performing masticating juice extractor.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Features of the J8006
         </h2>
         <p>
          Even though it may not be the latest generation juicer, it still has a lot of features that keep it relevant for a quality juicing experience. Some of what this workhorse offers includes:
         </p>
         <h3>
          Low 80 RPM speed
         </h3>
         <p>
          While most juicers have speeds of between 1650 and 15,000 rpm, the J8006 extracts juice at a speed of just 80 rpm. This allows it to squeeze fresh produce instead of grinding them, which helps to preserve healthy nutrients and enzymes, and maintain the natural taste and pure color of the juice. The slow speed also reduces heat build-up, clogging, foaming and oxidation, allowing your juice to stay for up to 72 hours without degrading.
         </p>
         <h3>
          8x More Auger Strength
         </h3>
         <p>
          The juicer comes with a GE Ultem Auger that’s 8x stronger than most plastics, as well as a powerful 2HP motor which enables you to extract juice from various fruits and vegetables effortlessly.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Dual-Stage Processing System
         </h3>
         <p>
          This innovative system enables the juicer to extract maximum amount of juice from your fresh produce. The juice is first extracted by crushing the fruits and vegetables. After that, the pulp is squeezed before being ejected during the second stage. As a result, you get more juice and a very dry pulp. Note that this juicer has an automatic pulp ejection, which allows for continuous juicing.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Versatile Masticating Juicer
         </h3>
         <p>
          The juicer allows you to do more than just juicing. You can use it to mince herbs and spices, grind coffee, make baby food, make nut butter from nuts, extrude pasta, whip up soy milk and so much more.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Sturdy Construction
         </h3>
         <p>
          It’s made using stainless steel; hence it’s strong and durable. In addition, it has a rubber tipped feet that’s also very sturdy and stable. The stainless steel gives the juicer a modern and attractive look, so you can be sure that it will look good in your kitchen.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Very Long Warranty
         </h3>
         <p>
          It comes with a 15-year warranty on the motor, which shows you just how durable this machine is. In fact some users have reported that they have had this juicer for 10+ years, and it’s still working well.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pros
         </h3>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Extremely Efficient
          </strong>
          – The powerful motor of this unit allows it to extract juice from a wide variety of fruits and vegetables with ease. You’ll can juice with it for several hours at a time, and it will not slow down or heat up.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Produces More, Quality Juice
          </strong>
          – The dual-stage processing system enables the juicer to extract high juicer yields, while its slow speed preserves essential nutrients and natural taste and color of the juice.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Easy To Use, Clean and Assemble
          </strong>
          – This is another reason why people love this juicer. It is extremely easy to use and assemble. You can also clean up all its components (feed chute, blade, auger and collection bin) easily either manually, or by placing them on the top rack of your dishwasher. Do the cleaning immediately after juicing, and use hot water for best results.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Quiet Operation
          </strong>
          – It operates more quietly compared to other masticating juicers. But, expect to hear some noise, which you can mitigate by putting the juicer on a towel.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Versatile
          </strong>
          – Besides extracting juice, you can use it to
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Jb32N38wU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
           make nut butter
          </a>
          , baby food, pasta and so much more.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Cons
         </h3>
         <p>
          The feeding tube is a bit small, so you have to cut your produce into smaller pieces before juicing them. This increases the preparation time, but it’s a small price to pay for enjoying fresh, nutritious and healthy juice whenever you want.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you’re looking for an efficient, user-friendly and durable juicer that can handle a wide variety of fruits and vegetables effortlessly, then you should give this Omega juicer a try.
