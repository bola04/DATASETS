      <p>
       MAME is a multi-purpose emulation framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAME's purpose is to preserve decades of software history. As electronic technology continues to rush forward, MAME prevents this important "vintage" software from being lost and forgotten. This is achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions. The source code to MAME serves as this documentation. The fact that the software is usable serves primarily to validate the accuracy of the documentation (how else can you prove that you have recreated the hardware faithfully?). Over time, MAME (originally stood for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles and calculators, in addition to the arcade video games that were its initial focus.

      <p>
       It’s the day you’ve been eagerly awaiting all month: MAME release
							day!  MAME 0.198, our May release, is packed full of improvements in
							lots of areas.  Newly supported arcade games include the rare video
							pinball game Tom Tom Magic, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu EX ’98, and
							Keirin Ou.  Newly supported computers include the TI-99/2, Dragon
							MSX-64, and BBC Master 512.
      </p>
      <p>
       This release brings graphics emulation improvements to a number of
							systems, including more fixes for Sega Saturn/ST-V, missing effects
							emulated in 1945k III, and improvements to the title screen in Wolf
							Fang.  The SH-4 recompiler now supports more FPU opcodes directly, and
							NAOMI keyboards are supported.  Low-level floppy drive emulation
							improvements bring improved compatibility for Apple II software.  Newly
							supported peripherals include a PC ISA LBA BIOS card, the Beeb Speech
							Synthesiser, and a number of BBC Micro pointing devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other additions include new Tiger handhelds (Batman: The Animated
							Series, Operation: Aliens, Wayne’s World, and X-Men), the Fidelity
							Elegance and Prestige chess computers, and alternate versions of Battle
							Balls, Centipede, Final Fight, Karate Blazers, Last Mission, Real
							Puncher, Sengoku 3, Spy Hunter, and World Heroes 2.  There are lots of
							additions to the Apple II cassette software list, and several additions
							to the Sorcerer cassette software list as well.  MAME now supports
							Korean user interface thanks to a contribution from Neius.
      </p>
      <p>
       For developers, we’ve fixed some issues in the debugger affecting
							CPUs that use word addressing, and the source list is sorted more
							intuitively in memory windows.  We’ve made a number of changes to how
							machine configuration works to make driver development more intuitive
							and less error-prone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you can read all the details in the

      <p>
       For our April release, we’re bringing even more elusive electronic
							esoterica to light.  MAME 0.197 finally includes support for the 1987
							version of the Spanish quiz game Master Boy, believed to be Gaelco’s
							first release.  There are now drivers for several Neo-Geo MVS variants,
							exposing different capabilities.  Lamp outputs are now supported for The
							Irritating Maze, bringing the game to life a little more.  We’ve added
							four more Tiger LCD games, all based on licensed IP: Home Alone, Home
							Alone 2, Independence Day, and Transformers – Generation 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sega Model 2 improvements keep coming, with Rail Chase 2 now
							working.  With its protection MCU emulated, Capcom’s F-1 Dream is also
							working.  MAME 0.197 adds support for alternate versions and bootlegs of
							a long list of systems, including Crazy Bonus 2002, Explosive Breaker,
							Fidelity Excel 68000, Lup Lup Puzzle, Pochi and Nyaa, Renegade, and
							Silkworm.  In addition, there are graphical improvements to Sega
							ST-V/Saturn, and Magical Tetris Challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some nice improvements for computer emulation this month,
							too.  The Acorn Electron has improved video handling and support for the
							Mega Games Cartridge.  The NEC PC-98 CD-ROM software list has been
							updated with the latest dumps and compatibility status – recent
							emulation improvements mean more fully supported titles.  You can now
							boot HP-BASIC cartridges on the HP9000/340 series.

       MAME 0.196, our March release, is here just in time for Easter, and
							it’s packed with all the goodness you’ve come to expect.  In a very
							exciting development, Team Caps0ff have
       <a href="http://caps0ff.blogspot.com/2018/03/taito-c-chip-data-by-lobotomy.html">
        extracted
							the C-chip data
       </a>
       for Volfied, Superman, Rainbow Islands, and most
							importantly, Bonze Adventure.  This cleanly fixes some of the most
							long-standing emulation issues in MAME.  The improvements to Sega
							Model 2 have continued, with Virtua Fighter 2 and Motor Raid now
							considered working.  Other Model 2 games are greatly improved as
							well.
      </p>
      <p>
       For fans of 8-bit home computers, MAME 0.196 has improved ZX Spectrum
							family emulation, fixing many graphical glitches.  A QuikLoad option has
							been added to several CP/M-80 machines, allowing .COM files to be loaded
							directly after the operating system has booted.  Emulated IEEE-488
							(GPIB) can now be tunnelled over sockets, opening up the possibility to
							simulate peripherals outside MAME.  Interpro progress has continued, and
							is now at the point where you can boot the rebuild floppy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other new working arcade games include Big Buck Hunter, an older
							joystick-controlled version of Ghox, and a rare unprotected version of
							Opa Opa.  With some fixes to our vector maths, War: The Final Assault is
							working, and Gunpey has been made playable using decompressed sprite
							data extracted from a working board.  New LCD hand-helds include Dennis
							the Menace, Double Dragon 3, Jurassic Park, Spider-Man, The Addams
							Family, The Flash, and X-Men - Project X.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an emulation first, MAME 0.196 supports QSound DSP emulation.  For
							now, it’s only enabled for the vgmplay driver by default, and it
							requires a fairly fast computer to emulate at full speed.  It will be
							enabled by default when system requirements are a bit more modest.  The
							SH-4 recompiler has been enabled by default for Dreamcast-derived
							systems, giving substantial performance improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there are plenty of other improvements that you can read
							about in the

       Whether you’re experiencing a cold snap in Spring or an Autumn
							heatwave, we hope you’ll enjoy MAME 0.195 just in time for the last
							day of February.  Goodies in this release include further
							improvements to V.R. Technologies NES-derived hardware, a few more Tiger
							handhelds, a number of Donkey Kong hacks, the original version of Gigas
							Mark II, the official Taiwanese release of Street Fighter II': Champion
							Edition, and more BBC Electron cartridges.  If you’re interested in
							home-to-arcade conversions, you might want to check out the ultra-rare
							Spanish title Hammer Boy, developed by Dinamic and brought to arcades by
							Inder – it plays like an oversize Game &amp; Watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Namco NA1 emulation has been overhauled, with big visual improvements
							for Numan Athletics and X-Day 2.  Background alignment has been fixed in
							Popeye, and the driver has been cleaned up overall.  We’ve received lots
							of patches from cam900, covering a large number of drivers.  As well as
							a lot of code cleanup, highlights include ES5510 DSP effects for Taito’s
							Ensoniq-based sound hardware, improved graphics priorities in Sand
							Scorpion and Jackie Chan, graphical improvements in Data East MLC games
							(Skull Fang is closer to working), and K051649 support in the vgmplay
							driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the new working systems, this release includes preliminary
							support for a number of interesting systems.  These include the XaviX
							platform (used for the Taito Nostalgia and Play TV/ConnecTV lines), the
							Olympia BOSS, and the Panafacom Duet.  IPL-disable has been fixed for
							Flash-based TI-8x series calculators.  At opposite ends of the spectrum,
							graphics emulation is noticeably better for Sega Model 2 and the
							Interpro workstations.  We’ve also added VM Labs Aries disassembly
							support (this is the multi-core VLIW processor used in NUON-enhanced
							DVD players).
      </p>
      <p>
       This month, we’ve seen far more internal improvement, code cleanup
							and modernisation than user-visible improvements.  This is all part of
							our effort to make the code more maintainable, paving the way for future
							improvements and keeping MAME relevant.  That said, the list of
							emulation improvements and newly supported systems is quite impressive.
							We’d like to thank all the contributors helping make MAME what it is
							today.

       Today we’re proud to deliver MAME 0.194, the first MAME release of
							2018.  Following on from the optimisation in last month’s release, MAME
							now features a Hyperstone E1-XS recompiler, giving substantial
							performance improvements in a number of Korean games.  Several issues
							affecting cheats, lua scripting, the internal debugger, and disassembly
							have been resolved.  We’ve added support for the prototype Atari game
							Cyberstorm, and Gaelco’s Last KM which was designed to integrate with an
							exercise bike.  This release expands and improves support for TV games
							with fixed software.  Additions include the TV Boy II, Super TV Boy, and
							Radica Space Invaders.  Emulation has been substantially improved for
							games using NES-derived hardware from V.R. Technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flow of LCD handheld games shows no sign of abating  This month
							we’ve added Thief in Garden, Super Double Dragon, Vindicators, Skeleton
							Warriors, and The Incredible Crash Test Dummies.  There are plenty more
							improvements to FM Towns emulation in this release, allowing more games
							to boot and fixing graphical errors.  The Matsushita MyBrain 3000 and
							closely-related Ericsson Step/One have been promoted to working.  Acorn
							Electron peripherals have been overhauled and several new options are
							available.
      </p>
      <p>
       In arcade emulation, we’ve got improved graphics emulation for
							Nintendo’s Popeye, and support for two more bootleg versions.  There are
							also improvements to graphical effects in several Data East games, and
							improvements to IGS PGM2 emulation making Knights of Valour 3 playable.
							Plenty more alternate versions of supported arcade games have been
							added.  One does deserve a mention, and that’s Bioplaything Cop, a
							prototype of Gaelco’s Biomechanical Toy.

       It’s a bit late for Christmas, but MAME 0.193 is ready today.  First
							of all, let’s get the disclaimers out of the way.  We’ve switched to
							GCC 7 for Windows binaries, and started requiring SSE 2 (Pentium 4,
							Opteron, Athlon 64, or equivalent) for 32-bit Windows binaries.  In the
							unlikely event that either of these changes causes issues for your use
							case, you’ll have to build from source.  There’s currently an issue with
							overlay artwork not being displayed when using bgfx video output.
							Unfortunately we haven’t been able to address this in time for the
							release.  As a workaround, we recommend using Direct3D or OpenGL video
							output for systems that use overlay artwork (this includes many
							handheld/tabletop games, Space Invaders, and the Vectrex console).  You
							can track progress on this issue
       <a href="http://mametesters.org/view.php?id=6806">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, the stuff you’ve all been waiting for: the highlights.
							We’ve added support for a whole lot of Tiger handhelds based on licensed
							IP in this release, including the unmissable MC Hammer, Batman Forever,
							Nightmare Before Christmas, and Robocop 2.  We’ve also added some of
							Tiger’s handheld renditions of popular games from other platforms, like
							Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter II, Battletoads, and Space Harrier II.
							On the arcade side, newly working games include prototypes Calcune and
							In Your Face, a location test version of Teki Paki, PGM2 titles Oriental
							Legend 2 and Knights of Valour 2 New Legend, and a number of beatmania
							IIDX titles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Computer fans don’t need to feel left out this Christmas, either.
							The Agat-7 floppy drive emulation has been improved to the point where
							it’s considered working, and the internal HP-9845 printer is now
							supported.  If you’re at all interested in the FM Towns, you
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to give this release a try, as r09 has made numerous
							improvements to sprites and scrolling, and greatly improved keyboard
							behaviour.  There are also some big software list updates across a
							number of systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there are plenty more improvements you can read about in

       We’ll be making a few changes to the Windows binaries from MAME 0.193
							onwards.  This will only affect pre-built Windows binaries distributed
							from mamedev.org and github.com  – packaged source won’t be affected,
							and default build settings won’t change.  If everything goes to plan,
							the following changes will be made:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries will be built with GCC 7.2 (changed
							from GCC 6.3).  This change shouldn’t be noticeable for most users.
       </li>
       <li>
        32-bit binaries will require SSE2.  Minimum CPU required will be
							Intel Pentium 4, AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64, or equivalent.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       A number of Linux distributions have already switched to GCC 7, and a
							significant number of MAME developers and users build MAME with GCC 7 on
							Windows.  We don’t anticipate any major issues as a result.  The minimum
							supported GCC version is still GCC 5.1 and is unlikely to change for
							some time yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Requiring SSE 2 improves performance and makes behaviour of 32-bit
							and 64-bit builds more consistent.  Note that this only affects our
							packaged binary releases – by default, 32-bit x86 builds won’t require
							SSE.  You’ll just have to compile MAME yourself if the SSE 2 requirement
							is a problem for your use case.  However, recent MAME versions are
							unlikely to perform well on x86 CPUs that predate SSE 2 support.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other news, the latest version of the Visual Studio 2017 C++
							compiler is capable of building MAME.  Visual Studio 2015 will be the
							primary supported version of Visual Studio for a few more releases, but
							if you were holding off updating to Visual Studio 2017 because of
							problems compiling variable templates and constexpr, you’ll be pleased
							to know that Microsoft has resolved these issues.
