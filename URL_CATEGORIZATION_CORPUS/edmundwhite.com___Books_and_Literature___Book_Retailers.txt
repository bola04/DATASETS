              Edmund White was born 
                        on January 13, 1940, in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father was, 
                        according to White, "a small entrepreneur who made 
                        a lot of money and then lost most of it during the time 
                        when small businessmen were being superceded by big corporations." 
                        When White was seven his parents divorced, and he went 
                        with his mother and sister to live on the outskirts of 
                        Chicago. Summers were spent with his father in Cincinnati.
             </p>

              In his 1991 essay titled 
                        "Out of the Closet, Onto the Bookshelf," White 
                        has written, "As a young teenager I looked desperately 
                        for things to read that might excuse me or assure me I 
                        wasn't the only one, that might confirm an identity I 
                        was unhappily piecing together. In the early 1950s, the 
                        only books I could find in the Evanston, Illinois, Public 
                        Library were Thomas Mann's
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679722068/edmundwhite-20">
               Death

              (which suggested that homosexuality was 
                        fetid, platonic and death-dealing) and the biography of 
                        Nijinsky by his wife (in which she obliquely deplored 
                        the demonic influence of the impresario Diaghilev on her 
                        saintly husband, the great danceran influence that 
                        in this instance had produced not death but madness)."
             </p>
             <p align="left" class="bodysmall">
              White attended the exclusive 
                        Cranbrook Academy, and later majored in Chinese at the 
                        University of Michigan. Moving to New York City ("in 
                        pursuit of someone I later captured and lived with for 
                        five years"), he worked for Time-Life Books from 
                        1962 until 1970. He writes, "I never considered myself 
                        a company man. I rushed home from work to my apartment 
                        on MacDougal Street, ate something and promptly went to 
                        bed. At eleven I would rise, dress as a hippie, and head 
                        out for the bars." After a year's sojourn in Rome, 
                        White returned to the U.S., where he served as an editor 
                        at
              <u>
               The Saturday Review

              Beginning in the mid-1970s, 
                        he and six other gay New York writersAndrew Holleran, 
                        Robert Ferro, Felice Picano, George Whitmore, Christopher 
                        Cox, and Michael Grumleyformed a casual club known 
                        as the Violet Quill. Meeting in one another's apartments, 
                        they would read and critique one another's work, then 
                        move on to high tea. Together they represented a flowering 
                        of the kind of gay writing Edmund White as a teenager 
                        in Illinois had longed to discover. White's novels include 
                        his allegorical fantasia on Fire Island life,

              In 1983 he moved to France; 
                        when he returned in 1990 it was to a literary landscape 
                        devastated by AIDS. Four members of the Violet QuillFerro, 
                        Grumley, Cox and Whitmorehad died, as well as numerous 
                        other promising young writers such as Tim Dlugos and John 
                        Fox. White's two closest friends, the critic David Kalstone 
                        and his editor Bill Whitehead, were also dead from the 
                        disease. He has written, "For me, these losses were 
                        definitive. The witnesses to my life, the people who had 
                        shared the same references and sense of humor, were gone. 
                        The loss of all the books they might have written remains 
                        incalculable."

             <p align="left" class="bodysmall">
              Although White is known 
                        as a novelist whose work has been widely praised by such 
                        writers as Vladimir Nabokov and Susan Sontag, it is as 
                        a cultural critic that White has perhaps had his greatest 
                        influence. Urbane, knowing, sophisticated, he has chronicled 
                        gay life in the seventies through the nineties with wit 
                        and insight. He has become a grand arbiter of taste, though 
                        he has been criticized for the narrowness of that tasteespecially 
                        after his 1992 anthology
              <a href="/html/shortfiction.htm">
               Gay

              contained no writing by men of color.

              The cumulative effect 
                        of White's presence simultaneously within so many different 
                        genres was to begin to define, in the late 1970s and early 
                        1980s, the parameters of "gay culture," whatever 
                        that evolving entity might be. AIDS, of course, has darkened 
                        all that, and White has written of the dilemma facing 
                        gay writers today: "Some . . . think that it's unconscionable 
                        to deal with anything [other than AIDS]; others believe 
                        that since gay culture is in imminent danger of being 
                        reduced to a single issue, one that once again equates 
                        homosexuality with a dire medical condition, the true 
                        duty of gay writers is to remind readers of the wealth 
                        of gay accomplishments. Only in that way, they argue, 
                        will a gay heritage be passed down to a post-plague generation." 
                        White's own choice has been clear: his most recent work 
                        is a monumental biography of the French novelist and playwright 
                        Jean Genet that celebrates this treasure of our gay heritage, 
                        and argues for the centrality of Genet's homosexuality 
                        to any consideration of his oeuvre. As for Edmund White, 
                        he and his workprivileged, literate, sophisticated, 
                        hedonisticremain central to any consideration of 
                        gay male upper-middle-class life in late 20th-century 
                        America.

                      White frequently 
                                      saw the novelist and historian Marina Warner, 
                                      whom he had first met when he had invited 
                                      her to speak at the New York Institute for 
                                      the Humanities. She, together with all of 
                                      White's friends, located the essential core 
                                      of his character as a genius for friendship: 
                                      an absolute openness towards absorbing the 
                                      idiosyncrasies, aberrations and ecstasies 
                                      of other people, and returning them fully 
                                      from the resources of his own identity. 
                                      The amplitude and diversity of White's friendships 
                                      demonstrated the sheer vastness of the engagement 
                                      with the ideal of friendship: as a human 
                                      relationship to be executed with a total 
                                      lack of duplicity, with an enduring empathy 
                                      and solicitude, and a perpetual, candidly 
                                      curious eye on what that friendship could 
                                      transmit in tactile experience or in knowledge 
                                      of sex. White's friends saw his character 
                                      shot luxuriantly through with mischief and 
                                      desire, oscillating between discipline and 
                                      anarchism, and always receptively ready 
                                      for the ludicrous and the hilarious aspects 
                                      of a life spent existing primarily in the 
                                      colliding worlds of sex and art.

                                      unlimited by either the rigidity of political 
                                      correctness, or by the persecution of individuals 
                                      for their race or sexuality (for White, 
                                      the power structures behind those two forms 
                                      of repression have a resemblance). In large 
                                      part, his experiences as an outsider in 
                                      Parisand his contacts with other expatriate 
                                      writers and artists theregave to White 
                                      his view of the future of culture as hybrid 
                                      and proliferating, impossible to pin down 
                                      to a national or political or social formula, 
                                      and finally, joyfully elusive.

                      White's work explores 
                                      what it is to experience life fully. His 
                                      work has dealt with everything from the 
                                      minutely nuanced moods of gay childhood 
                                      to the sudden desolation resulting from 
                                      AIDS. His compelling fascination is for 
                                      the beauty of the male human body, for sex 
                                      and for death, and for the impulses behind 
                                      creativity. In White's world, these preoccupations 
                                      and values move irrepressibly and provocatively 
                                      between one another. He has said: "I do 
                                      think that sex is something worth dying 
                                      for. I believe what art is primarily about 
                                      is beauty, and what beauty is about is death." 
                                      So White's world burns.

                     And I am reading Edmund White's
                     <em>
                      Hotel de Dream
                     </em>
                     —what White calls "a New York novel." It's also historical: about Stephen Crane, who is dying, dictating a novel to his wife—about a boy prostitute in New York in the 1890s. It's a novel-within-a-novel, and it's flawless. I love Edmund White. Every time I read a new book of his, I am reminded of a previous book of his, which I then reread. I've interrupted
                     <em>
                      Hotel de Dream
                     </em>
                     to reread White's novel
                     <em>
                      A Boy's Own Story
                     </em>
                     , which I love, and White's autobiography
                     <em>
                      My Lives
                     </em>
                     . He's a wonderful writer. We're the same age, and I remember when I first read
                     <em>
                      A Boy's Own Story
                     </em>
                     —in the early 1980s—and I thought that the novel spoke much more to me about a boy coming of age (even though it's about a gay boy coming of age, and I'm not gay) than
                     <em>
                      The Catcher in the Rye
                     </em>
                     ever did. I reread
                     <em>
                      The Catcher in the Rye
                     </em>
                     recently, and it doesn't hold up at all; it's just not very well, or very consistently, written. But
                     <em>
                      A Boy's Own Story
                     </em>
                     is beautifully wrought, and fiercely defiant; I could reread that novel every year and find something terrific I had missed in a previous reading.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodysmall">
                     I believe Edmund White is one of the best writers of my generation; he's certainly the contemporary American writer I reread more than any other, and the one whose next book I look forward to reading most.

                     It looks as if a new Hate Crimes Bill, which George W. Bush threatened to veto, may be signed into law very soon by President Obama.  The bill, which would make it a crime to assault someone because of his or her sexual orientation, has been named after Matthew Shepard, a gay teenager who was beaten to death in October 1998, and James Byrd Jr., and African American dragged behind a vehicle and killed the same year.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left" class="bodysmall">
                     The bill, which was added to a $680 billion defense authorization bill, passed by large majorities in the House and the Senate, despite allegations by conservative Christians who claimed the new law would be used to persecute people who protest against homosexuality or abortion.  These conservatives have been assured that the law will protect LGBT citizens against violence but will not infringe on anyone’s freedom of speech.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left" class="bodysmall">
                     The passage of this law will give the federal government the tools it needs to deter and prosecute anti-gay violence.  Its passage will be a testament to the thousands of lesbians and gays who have fought for it over the years—and to the heterosexuals (including Matthew Shepard’s mother) who have supported the measure as a necessary extension of fundamental civil rights.
