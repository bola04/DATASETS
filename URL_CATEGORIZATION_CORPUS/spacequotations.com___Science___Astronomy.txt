          It's a famous line, seen 
            often
            
            online and in print. It's almost 
            always in quotation marks, and it's almost always attributed to 
            Leonardo da Vinci. But that is wrong. How could 
            Leonardo (1452 - 1519) taste flight? I've searched for years, but 
            have never found definitive 
            source information for this line.
          <i>
           National Geographic Magazine
          </i>
          researchers told me they talked to a leading da Vinci expert who 
            said Leonardo never wrote it.

          </a>
          by Domenico Laurenza 
            never mentions the line.

           </u>
          </a>
          by science writer Stefan 
            Klein is devoted to da Vinci's dream of mechanical flight, yet 
            it also never mentions 
            the line.  Rather, it concludes "after thirty years of tireless work, Leonardo's dream of flying had 
            reverted to what it was in the first days of his research — a 
            flight of the imagination" (page 126).

          But this "quote" holds a strong appeal 
            to our psyche; maybe because many of us have our eyes, minds and 
            hearts turned upward to space. So it's my title here on the 
            internet. A place where astronomers and astronauts, dreamers and 
            doers, share with us their best 
            thoughts on space. 
            And the title is also a reminder to me to be as accurate as I can in 
            recording original source information.

          I find it interesting that several other popular space quotes are 
            also actually myths or misquotes:

          Reading, dreaming and thinking about crazy space ideas has already 
            resulted in us driving a car on the
