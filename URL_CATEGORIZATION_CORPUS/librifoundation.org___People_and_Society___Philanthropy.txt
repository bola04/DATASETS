   The Libri Foundation is a nationwide non-profit organization which

   <br/>
   BOOKS FOR CHILDREN program.

    After 26 years and over $7 million worth of new, quality, hardcover children's books donated to over 3,300 libraries, The Libri Foundation has closed its doors.
   </b>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   We thank all of our wonderful donors for their generous support and all of the rural librarians we've worked with over the years for their hard work and dedication. It has been our pleasure to help put new books into the hands of eager young readers.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you would like to continue to help rural children have access to quality books, we encourage you to support

    The Libri Foundation's Mission
   </b>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The Libri Foundation was established in 1989 for the sole
purpose of helping rural libraries acquire new, quality, hardcover
children's books they could not otherwise afford to buy. Since
October 1990, the Foundation has donated over $7 million worth of
new children's books to more than 3,300 libraries in all 50 states.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Foundation supports the concept that children who learn to
enjoy reading at an early age continue to read throughout their
lives. In order to develop a love of reading, children must have
access to books which stretch their imaginations, touch their
emotions, expand their horizons.
  </p>
  <p>
   For many children in rural areas, the local public library is
often their primary source of reading material. Many rural schools
either have no library or the library is inadequate to meet the
needs of the students. At a time when more and more children and
their parents and teachers are using the public library, these same
libraries are facing increasing financial hardships and are unable
to buy the books their young readers need.
  </p>
  <p>
   The books donated through the BOOKS FOR CHILDREN program are
used for storytelling; toddler, preschool, and after-school
programs; summer reading programs; "book buddy" programs in which
older children read to younger children; holiday programs; teacher
check-out and curriculum support; early childhood development
programs; school projects and to just provide children with a "good
read."
