     “ I first joined veggieconnection (omisinurheart) after not having luck on other vegan sites.  Few guys caught my attention and I never looked Globally... only 200 mile radius. Then one day, a view from another activist and vegan caught my eye. He was from Canada and he was sooo much like me. I added him to my favorites and to my surprise he added me back AND messaged me a REAL message.  We talked via veggieconnection and moved to emails and phone shortly after.  Skype was next and I found myself falling for him. We were so similar and had the same views on almost everything. I felt like he was the male version of me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now as I type this,  I am sitting clear across the continent from New York to British Columbia right next to my soulmate Devin. Devin (shadowski) and I made our first visit together back in May. We are planning to move in together this October and fight for animal rights while becoming better vegans.  Thank you so much for bringing us together.

     “ We met on veggiconnection on December 1st when Maruko (real name Yvonne) sent me a greeting. Her being from Indonesia, and I from the US, I couldn't imagine this as being more than a nice pen-pal kind of relationship. Over the next few months, we found we shared many values, so I flew to Indonesia and spent 3 weeks getting to know her in person, meeting family, and getting a feel for the culture of her homeland.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We spent nearly a year communicating online before her fiance visa was approved, so we had lots of time to learn more about each other and to probe all the non-physical aspects of a relationship.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On February 28th, she and her son Richard arrived here in Honolulu. On April 13th, we were married, but we both feel that we were married in a more personal way back when we were together in Indonesia.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I think that the values that brought both of us to veggieconnection were more fundamental predictors of relationship success than anything an eHarmony or the like could ever come up with. We're looking forward to many adventures together and to spend the rest of our lives together.

When I saw he'd looked at my profile but not left a message, I contacted him.  Over the last year we both crossed the Atlantic a few times and when Richard came back in March we decided to get married - the ceremony was a couple of weeks ago and Richard's dogs arrived last week.    If it wasn't for you we would have never met.  Thank you so much.

     “ At one point in our lives, we both (Giannis &amp; Othmantus) seemed to have lost all hopes to find true love, but this site allowed us, unexpectedly, to find each other in the end. Although living worlds apart (culturally and geographically), the unique organization of this site helped to establish quickly a strong connection between us. Thus, were overcome the first hurdles on our relationship, which finally saw flourishing a true passion that pushed Othmantus to come all the way from Singapore (South East Asia) to Montreal (Canada), where our first meeting was wholly successful. We quickly came to realize that our first impression was right and that we are indeed meant for each other. We are now preparing for me (Giannis) to relocate to Singapore and for us to get married and happy there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We are grateful to veggieconnection and we both would like to encourage people around the vegetarian community (and beyond) to become a member of this great community. We would like again to thank this site, because its
     <br/>
     truly a wonderful job done. At first, doubts clouded our hearts as to whether or not we could find what we were looking for. In the end, our similarities of being vegetarians and open minded families have allowed us to become a couple of perfect lovers. On top of this winning scenario only a bit of sense of humor and enthusiasm is good enough to warm our hearts up tremendously. Well live together next year and the romance shall continue.May you all find true love with veggieconnection. ”

     “ Settling down with a meat eater wasn't an option for either of us. Thanks to this site it didnt have to be. We exchanged messages at first and talked about all things veggie environmental and generally any thing else. It wasn't too long before we decided to meet up (July 30th). We have been seeing each other since and are extremely happy together! ”

     “ Fitandtrim and Len are together now thanks to Veggie Connection. Our first meeting was on February 19. After exchanging a few emails we decided to meet our first time at a chamber music concert at a church we both know. We went to a nearby restaurant afterwards to share a veggie sandwich. We quickly realized we have many interests in common and have been together ever since. We rotate visits to our respective homes, usually on weekends, depending on the activities we plan. We are so happy together and the intimacy we share is incredible!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We know that this was a match made possible by your astute team, but we think it was a union made in heaven!

     Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! ”

     “ Surprise! I don't know if we can claim some sort of record yet but........we met through veggieconnection.com 6 months ago. Bizarrely Snookums lives in England and Bigbluemarble in New England, a mere 3250 miles apart! Neither of us were looking beyond 100 miles and certainly not considering re-locating...but after you featured Bigbluemarble, Snookums just had this impulse to send a message. Bigbluemarble responded almost instantly and we got into an immediate pattern of sending daily e-mail letters to each other...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Despite the distance we have now met 4 times (Snookums is in New England at the moment) and are simply 'in love' and are planning to be together permanently in the near future.

     <br/>
     This could never of happened without Veggieconnection.com... we are deeply indebted to your website... Attached is a photo taken 04/11/05 at the top of Mount Monadnock, New Hampshire. ”
