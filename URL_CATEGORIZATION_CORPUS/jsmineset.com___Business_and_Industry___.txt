         Social Security Benefits Buy 34 Percent Less Than In 2000, Study Shows
        </b>
        <br/>

         June 21, 2018

        <i>
         If you feel like your Social Security check doesn’t stretch as far as it once did, there’s a likely explanation for it.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Since 2000, the buying power of monthly benefits has fallen by more than a third, according to an annual report released Thursday by the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group based in Alexandria, Virginia.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         In other words, the cost of goods and services common among retirees have collectively risen faster than the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, that Social Security recipients get every year.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         “People who recently retired might have seen only a [small] decrease in buying power,” said Mary Johnson, a policy analyst for the league. “But those retired for a long time are feeling the cumulative effect of this.”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         About 47 million older Americans receive Social Security. Overall, the benefits comprise about a third of income among those age 65 or older, according to the Social Security Administration.

         China Can Hurt America In Trade War Six Ways From Sunday
        </b>
        <br/>
        <i>
         June 21, 2018
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         The threat of a full-scale trade war between the US and China has dominated the news in recent weeks. The countries have exchanged import tariffs on each other’s goods, and are threatening further protective steps.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         After numerous threats to tax Chinese imports, US President Donald Trump fired the first shot by approving $50 billion in tariffs that will come into force on July 6. Beijing immediately responded by imposing a 25-percent tariff on American imports worth $34 billion, which will come into effect on the same day.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Trump issued a threat to impose additional 10-percent levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods coming to the US. This prompted a pledge from China’s Commerce Ministry to “forcefully fight back” with “qualitative” and “quantitative” measures.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         The mutual exchange came two months after the White House slapped China and several other nations, including Russia and India, with an import tax of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. In late May, the measure was extended to the EU, Canada and Mexico.

         China Cuts US Investments By 92% Amid Escalating Trade War

         The US market saw a significant plunge in investment from China in the first five months of the year amid a growing trade row between the world’s two largest economies.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Chinese investments totaled $1.8 billion from January through May, representing a 92-percent drop against the same period a year ago. That’s the lowest level in seven years, according to the latest report by Rhodium Group, a research provider that tracks Chinese foreign investment.

        <i>
         Chinese corporations that had been pumping cash into the US to cement ties over a long period have cut their investments in recent years. In 2017, investments declined by 36 percent to $29.7 billion from $46.5 billion during the previous year.

         “The more confrontational approach of the Trump administration toward economic relations with China has cast some doubt, in these companies’ minds, about their position here,” said Thilo Hanemann, a director at Rhodium Group, as quoted by CNN Money.

         The Diseased, Lying, Condition of America’s ‘News’ Media
        </b>
        <br/>
        <i>
         June 21, 2018

        <i>
         Both President Trump and former President Obama are commonly said in America’s ‘news’ media to be or to have been “ceding Syria to Russia” or “ceding Syria to Russia and Iran,” or similar allegations. They imply that ‘we’ own (or have some right to control) Syria. That’s not only a lie; it is a very evil and harmful one, dangerously goading the US President to go even more against Russia (and Iran) (and, of course, against Syria) than has yet been done — but the ‘news’media don’t care about that evil, and that falsehood, and that dangerousness — they do it anyway, and none of them attacks the others for perpetrating this vicious war-mongering lie, that lying provocation to yet more and worse war than already exists there. And the fact that none is exposing the fraudulence of the others on this important matter, is a yet-bigger additional scandal, beyond and amplifying the media’s common lying itself. Because they all function here like a mob, goading to more and worse invasions, and doing it on the the basis of dangerous lies — that America, and not the Syrians themselves, own Syria.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         These lies simply assume that America (probably referring to the US Government, but whatever) somehow “has” or else “had” Syria (so that America can now ‘cede’ it, to anyone); and this assumption (that the US somehow owns Syria) is not only an imperialistic one (which is bad, and wrong, in itself), but it reduces to nothingness the rights (in the minds of the American public) of the Syrian people, to control their own land. That lie is what America’s ‘news’media won’t expose, but instead they all cooperate with it, when they’re not actually participating, themselves, in spreading these lies.

         We start our last day of the Triple Witch Week with Gold moving higher with the price now at $1,271.50, $1 higher inside a $5 trading range between $1,273.10 and $1,268.40 sometime before 6am pst. Silvers trade is now at $16.50 (Sept contract) with a high so far at $16.535 and a low of $16.385. We start quoting the next month’s contracts when the Open Interest in the previous month (July) falls below the next traded obligation (Sept). In other words, we always talk the price that has the largest Open Interest. The US Dollars trade is now at 94.25, down 15.4 points after being knocked down to 94.095 with a high at 94.55. Admittedly, this is an odd week because most of the time, precious metals get whacked on these last trading days during the bankers inventory check and balance week. The tactics were changed for some reason forcing the metals lower last Friday. Odd imo and maybe proof of the price hex being removed (let us pray).

         Speaking of Open Interest, June Silvers receipt obligations are still at 1 but with a volume so far of 6 which means our buyer(s) are still in need and are not hesitating one bit to keep on adding more and more. Silvers over all OI is now at 219,697. A gain of 1,591 contracts in order to keep things stagnant.

         (Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch today released newly obtained internal IRS documents, including material revealing that Sen. John McCain’s former staff director and chief counsel on the Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee, Henry Kerner, urged top IRS officials, including then-director of exempt organizations Lois Lerner, to “audit so many that it becomes financially ruinous.” Kerner was appointed by President Trump as Special Counsel for the United States Office of Special Counsel.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         The explosive exchange was contained in notes taken by IRS employees at an April 30, 2013, meeting between Kerner, Lerner, and other high-ranking IRS officials. Just ten days following the meeting, former IRS director of exempt organizations Lois Lerner admitted that the IRS had a policy of improperly and deliberately delaying applications for tax-exempt status from conservative non-profit groups.

       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Lerner and other IRS officials met with select top staffers from the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in a “marathon” meeting to discuss concerns raised by both Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) that the IRS was not reining in political advocacy groups in response to the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. Senator McCain had been the chief sponsor of the McCain-Feingold Act and called the Citizens United decision, which overturned portions of the Act, one of the “worst decisions I have ever seen.”

               <br/>
               It’s a radical “reform” of the U.S. dollar… meant to create a “fairer” and more “equal” society…
               <br/>
               Supporters like Professor Eric Tymoigne at Bard College, or Delman Coates at The Black Church Center for Justice and Equality, claim this reform is necessary to solve “social and economic injustice.”
               <br/>
               But there’s a darker truth behind this trend.

        <i>
         For the past decade in which relevant predicate acts were corruptly carried out by the named defendants as “payback” for Plaintiff Gary Byrne’s role in the Clinton impeachment and his status as a “Clinton enemy” (for his temerity in telling the truth concerning obstruction of justice and gross abuse of power), along with their corrupt surrogates and collaborators (referenced individually and collectively as the “Enterprise”), David Brock and William and Hillary Clinton have been synonymous with criminal behavior, malicious baseless attacks (using mainly the illicit and vicious defamatory tactics against perceived political enemies (like Officer Gary Byrne, the Plaintiff here) of those willing to compensate participants like Brock) – and coordinating by mail and wire to violate myriad Federal and State laws in the exploitation of Enterprise nonprofit entities they use for purely partisan purposes.

         This Billboard In Texas Tells Liberals To Get Lost. After Backlash, It’s Coming Down

         UPDATE: Since this story was first published, the billboard owner responded to a request for comment, saying that the billboard would be taken down and the client reimbursed, after media coverage and social media backlash to the sign’s message.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         “Howdy, y’all,” is the folksy, welcoming greeting that has made Texas known for a relaxed, down-home charm over the years.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         But that’s not the message motorists are getting from a billboard causing a stir on social media.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         “Liberals,” the billboard reads. “Please continue on I-40 until you have left our GREAT STATE OF TEXAS.”
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         At least that’s what it will read until sometime Wednesday. Randy Burkett, who owns Burkett Outdoor Advertising and the sign, told McClatchy that after all the backlash and media attention the sign got on Tuesday and Wednesday, it would be taken down immediately.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         “I was shocked that it traveled that fast,” Burkett said. “I believe in free speech, but this country is divided enough as it is. I’ve spoken with the client, and he’s agreed that it should come down. We’ll be reimbursing him.”

         The controversy surrounding illegal immigrant family separation has caused a mainstream media feeding frenzy this week — but when CNN tried to get in the middle of the action Tuesday, it blew up in the network’s face.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         In fact, CNN star Brooke Baldwin tried to shame National Border Patrol Council spokesman Chris Cabrera over the harsh separation of illegal immigrant families. She tried to blame President Donald Trump and conservatives for the story that’s just now gained national attention.
        </em>
       </p>

        <em>
         Instead, Baldwin was left gasping when she learned the harsh truth about the U.S. border.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Cabrera was prepared for CNN and quickly flipped their script — and in the end, Baldwin was thanking him for his service to our country.

         June Silver’s Open Interest is now at 34 with zero volume so far. After yesterday’s write up, someone stepped into June’s delivery cycle and painted a 110+/- volume on the board which may mean a buyer and seller agreed to the swap before the COMEX close which would have increased the OI if it had taken longer to agree. This of course is one of the many ways to hide the sausage in the ledger game banks have mastered over the decades. Silver’s over all OI is now at 219,110 contracts, a drop of 2,289 obligations from the previous early morning as we see the squaring out of the July trades before the First Notice Day.

This is not a time to be “all in” the markets, in fact it may be a damn good reason to be all out of the third party system completely because it is absolutely falling apart right before our eyes. Anyone who thinks these issues mean nothing, and are simply the ramblings of failed traders, will find the so called “failed” being the ones who were right all along because lately all trading is fake! What does one think the word “Artificial” and “Intelligence” mean when they are combined yet are separate words with completely different meanings? It’s exactly like “Television” and “Programming”, when put together, it’s a total mind f**k.

        Interestingly Wolfgang, after the change in currency to one that was gold backed, real estate immediately dropped 30%…and then started going down in real terms (versus gold). Real estate dropped because after the currency change as they say “there was no money on the streets”. Gold is the only true yardstick to measure value against when all is said and done.

        Existing Home Sales Slump To Lowest Since Jan: “Housing Affordability Is Becoming A Crisis”

        People’s immediate reaction would be :  “Well, I guess house prices must fall if there are no buyers.”
       </p>
       <p>
        That could be a mistake.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Weimar Germany in the early 1920’s (during their ramp up to hyperinflation) house prices didn’t fall.  Even though people couldn’t even afford to buy an apple!
       </p>
       <p>
        Well worth thinking about.
       </p>
       <p>
        And if you think that the situation in America is different from Weimar, remember this:  When have you ever seen a country in so much indebtedness as us?
       </p>
       <p>
        And with Russia dumping their US Treasury holdings and China and the rest of the world cutting back their purchases, all that debt (increasing exponentially) will have to be monetized.

        Dear JJ,

       <p>
        It really is convenient to see no one can recover any lost funds from the perps in this wash, rinse, recycle again process. If I didn’t know better, I’d say this fine was a simple license fee to do it again and if caught, pay for another license.

         CFTC Orders JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to Pay $65 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

         Washington, DC – The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) today issued an Order filing and settling charges against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMC) for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark and requiring JPMC to pay a $65 million civil monetary penalty.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The CFTC Order finds that over a five-year period, beginning in at least January 2007 and continuing through January 2012 (the Relevant Period), JPMC made false reports and attempted to manipulate the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a leading global benchmark referenced in a range of interest rate products, to benefit its derivatives positions, including positions involving cash-settled options on interest rate swaps.
        </em>

        <em>
         James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: “This matter is one in a series of CFTC actions that clearly demonstrates the Commission’s unrelenting commitment to root out manipulation from our markets and to protect those who rely on the integrity of critical financial benchmarks.”

        Linear analysis never takes into account climate cycles. And history does show the earth does go through cycles of climate much like locusts come in cycles. And certain countries are experiencing real change that is not warming. Russia had the coldest spring in a 140 years which devastated their winter wheat harvest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Watch the coming outcry for taxation as Europe goes broke. As it is countries are rushing to load up on debt before the ECB stops buying so what comes next will be increasing taxes.

         Leaked UN Draft Report Warns Of Urgent Need To Cut Global Warming

        <em>
         The world is on track to exceed 1.5C of warming unless countries rapidly implement “far-reaching” actions to reduce carbon emissions, according to a draft UN report leaked to Reuters.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         The final draft report from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) was due for publication in October. It is the guiding scientific document for what countries must do to combat climate change.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Human-induced warming would exceed 1.5C by about 2040 if emissions continued at their present rate, the report found, but countries could keep warming below that level if they made “rapid and far-reaching” changes.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 countries signed up to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C.

         Practice shows that there are three topics connected to Moscow that attract genuine attention, and often also invoke the sincere surprise of the foreign financial press and expert community.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         The main mystery that the authors of the western financial periodical press try to solve is why the Russian economy hasn’t yet collapsed, despite unprecedented western sanctions? If it continues like this, then the meme about the “mysterious Russian economy” will occupy in the western news sphere a place near a meme about the “mysterious Russian soul”.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         One more topic moving the world is the Russian successes in relation to intercepting control over the OPEC oil cartel, which the Americans once created to advance their own interests. Now American journalists sadly joke that it is time to rename OPEC into ROPEK, because now it is Russia – which (oh the horror!) doesn’t react to the tweets of Trump demanding to immediately lower the prices of oil – that rules here.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         It is impossible to not mention the topic of the Russian gold reserves and the persistence with which the Central Bank buys gold for gold and foreign exchange reserves. Taking into account with the amount of this metal in its own stocks Russia already overtook even China, western analysts suspect that this strategy is a part of strengthened preparation for the collapse or radical reformatting of the world monetary system, after which gold will be the only “financial instrument” that not only keeps its value, but also raises it.

         What Does the North Korea-Trump ‘Best Friends’ Summit Portend for Iran?

         What an odd outcome: After all the threatened ‘fire and fury’, all the earlier bluster about complete, irreversible, verified, denuclearisation, and all the neocon bravura about Kim Jong Un having to transfer his nukes to the US, and having to undertake irreversible steps to strip himself nuclear-naked, as it were, prior to Trump lifting his little finger – all this melted away, like snow, into a show of BFFE (best friends for ever).

         “The Singapore summit was long on theatre and largely devoid of substance”, writes Professor Steven Walt, “save for a typical Trumpian giveaway. This time Donald Trump impulsively offered to suspend military exercises with South Korea (without notifying Seoul in advance) in exchange for a North Korean pledge to do – well, nothing. If the self-proclaimed master negotiator keeps making deals like this, there will be a Kim Jong Un Hilton in Honolulu, before there is a Trump Tower in Pyongyang. The most significant development in Singapore was to complete the transformation of Kim… into a serious and engaged world leader, of some stature.”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Was this just an example of creative, Trump unorthodoxy (face-to-face meeting in advance of substantive agreement) – i.e. the voiding of a blockage? Or, was it because the outlines to Kim Jong Un’s policy objectives have been clear since at least 2013, but the tilt point in turning it from something latent into substantive form, was the metamorphos in South Korea which gave Moon the clear mandate to seek the reunification of the Peninsular (something the North Korean leadership had long sought)?

         Murphy also included the District of Columbia in his research, and found it had a psychopathy level far higher than any other state. But this finding is an outlier, as Murphy notes, as it’s an entirely urban area and cannot be fairly compared with larger, more geographically diverse, US states. That said, as Murphy notes, “The presence of psychopaths in District of Columbia is consistent with the conjecture found in Murphy (2016) that psychopaths are likely to be effective in the political sphere.”

The mayor and resettlement organizations shrouded the plan in such secrecy that not even the town’s aldermen were informed of what was taking place behind closed doors.

       </p>
       <p>
        “I am a biblical scholar,” he replied.
       </p>
       <p>
        “A biblical scholar, hmmm?” the father said. “Admirable, but what will you do to provide a nice house for my daughter to live in?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “I will study,” the young man replied, “and God will provide for us.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “And how will you buy her a beautiful engagement ring, such as she deserves?” asked the father.
       </p>
       <p>
        “I will concentrate on my studies,” the young man replied, “God will provide for us.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “And children?” asked the father. “How will you support children?”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Don’t worry, sir, God will provide,” replied the fiancé.
       </p>
       <p>
        The conversation proceeded like this…and each time the father questioned, the young idealist insisted that God would provide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later, the mother asked, “How did your talk go, honey?”
       </p>
       <p>
        The father answered, “Another Democrat. He has no job, he has no plans, and he thinks I’m God.”

         Turley: Sessions’ Appointing Utah Federal Prosecutor Much Better for Trump than 2nd Special Counsel
        </strong>

        <em>
         WASHINGTON, DC – Professor Jonathan Turley, a top national legal expert on government investigations, commented on Thursday about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision to bring in U.S. Attorney John Huber. Turley called it “brilliant”to combine all the powers of the U.S. Department of Justice’s inspector general with a prosecutor who can bring charges, seek indictments, and get results for President Trump far more quickly than a second special counsel.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         Turley is a law professor at George Washington University, who attained national fame during the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton as a top legal authority on special counsels and congressional investigations of government wrongdoing, including criminal wrongdoing. His reputation has only grown during the intervening 20 years, as he has weighed in on scandals and investigations of public officials from both political parties.
