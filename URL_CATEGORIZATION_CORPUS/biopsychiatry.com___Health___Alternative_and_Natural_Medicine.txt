       Several excellent

       Most recently, the Internet

is a

       <a href="https://www.erythroxylum-coca.com/index.html">
        incompetent
       </a>
       route to a lifetime of happiness involves taking unsustainable psychostimulants
such as
       <a href="https://www.erythroxylum-coca.com/refs/index.html">
        cocaine
       </a>
       or the
       <a href="https://www.amphetamines.org/refs/index.html">
        amphetamines
       </a>
       .
In the short term, their activation of the sympathetic nervous system tends
to elevate mood, motivation and energy. Users tend to talk a lot. Self-confidence
is enhanced: these are "power drugs". Physical strength and mental acuity
are variably increased. Whereas cocaine blocks the neuronal re-uptake of
the
       <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/catecholdep.htm">

       , amphetamine
triggers to a much greater extent their synaptic release. Amphetamine feels coarser, lasts longer and costs less.
      </p>
      <p>
       In either case, libertarian
indignation that the State presumes to subject its citizens to totalitarian-style
mind-control should not obscure the fact that for most purposes these are
not useful drugs. This is because the central nervous system supports a
web of mutually inhibitory feedback-mechanisms. In response to a short-term
increase of
       <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/mechnov.htm">
        mood-mediating
       </a>
       monoamines
in the synapses, the genes and neuronal receptors
       <a href="https://www.wireheading.com/homeostasis.html">
        re-regulate
       </a>
       . So at best
no real long-term benefit is derived from the use of such compounds. Neither
cocaine nor amphetamine yield the sustained activation of intracellular
signal-transduction cascades needed to cheat the hedonic treadmill and keep us truly happy.

       Some people continue to
take psychostimulants casually for years without serious harm. Yet the potential

      . Repeated use of cocaine, heroin, ethyl alcohol and other euphoriant drugs induces a compensatory
      <a href="https://www.erythroxylum-coca.com/addiction/dynorphin.html">
       up-regulation
      </a>
      of the dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor system too, causing anxiety, anhedonia and dysphoria. Whereas mu receptor agonist opioids induce euphoria by enhancing dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, activation of kappa opioid receptors inhibits dopamine release from the mesolimbic terminals. This deficiency is subjectively unpleasant because the mesolimbic dopamine system regulates hedonic tone and the capacity to experience (and anticipate) happiness. Dopamine also modulates the threshold of pain perception. In May 2012, the first human trial of JDTic was halted after worries about the incidence of asymptomatic and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, casting a cloud of uncertainty over kappa therapeutics. But as of 2015, results in non-human "animal models" have been encouraging.
      <p>
       Unfortunately,
all opioids in present-day human use are flawed. Taken at fixed dosage, they lose some of their euphoriant and analgesic effect
as
       <a href="https://www.opioids.com/tolerance/index.html">
        tolerance
       </a>
       sets in; opioid drugs are physiologically addictive. Overdoses can cause
       <a href="https://www.opioids.com/overdose/index.html">
        respiratory depression
       </a>
       ; by contrast, physical pain is a potent respiratory stimulant. When taken recreationally, opioids inspire a dreamily contented disengagement
from the problems of the world. Their use diminishes our drive to
constructive activity as consumers in today's competitive global marketplace. More insidiously, excess consumption of narcotics
       <a href="https://www.oxytocin.org/oxy/oxyreg.html">
        inhibits
       </a>
       the release
of endogenous opioids normally induced by social interaction with friends
and
       <a href="https://www.opioids.com/red.html">
        family
       </a>
       . By diminishing
the craving for human companionship, the addict substitutes one form of
opioid addiction for another. Thus junkies are usually "selfish".
      </p>
      <p>
       The physical risks of opioid
use shouldn't be exaggerated. Most of the problems that users suffer ultimately
derive less from their choice of drug itself than from the illegal status
of narcotics in prohibitionist society. Yet even if opioid drugs were legal
and given away in cereal packets, such drugs wouldn't make a good choice of
mood-booster - or at least not in their present, tolerance-inducing and crudely non-specific guise.

By trapping most of us in "ordinary" waking consciousness, selfish DNA stumbled on a cunning trick to help its vehicles leave more copies of itself. Worse, the psychedelics aren't primarily euphoriants. They don’t directly stimulate the pleasure-centres and guarantee the user a good trip.

Depressives, neurotics and other troubled souls in search of enlightenment are most likely to undergo nightmarish freak-outs. Psychotic derealisation isn't illuminating - or fun. The drug-naïve mind can’t make an informed prior choice of whether to explore radically altered states.

       reversal
      </a>
      of all the good effects they initially
enjoyed from the drug. Taking a post-trip selective serotonin re-uptake

       fluoxetine
      </a>
      (

      otherwise experienced some 48 hours later. Yet taking SSRIs on a regular
basis largely nullifies the already attenuated benefits of prolonged Ecstasy
use. In any case, the duration of the peak E experience is a mere 90 minutes.
So taking Ecstasy scarcely amounts to a full-scale strategy for life either.

       gamma-hydroxybutyrate
      </a>
      (
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/gamma-hydroxybutyricacid.htm">
       GHB
      </a>
      ). GHB usually
takes the form of a clear, odourless, slightly salty-tasting liquid. In the brain, the GHB molecule is
also an endogenous precursor and metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/gabarev.htm">
       GABA
      </a>
      . GHB is non-toxic;
but it mustn't be mixed with
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/alcohol-abuse.htm">
       alcohol
      </a>
      or other depressants. It's metabolised
quickly to carbon dioxide and
      <a href="https://www.psychoactive.com/h2o.html">
       water
      </a>
      .
GHB's steep dose-response curve means naïve users run the severe risk of
falling asleep. When used lightly in recreational rather than stuporific
or anaesthetic doses, GHB is a touchy-feely compound which typically induces
deep muscular relaxation, a sense of serenity, and feelings of emotional
warmth. Often it enhances emotional openness and the desire to socialise.
Tactile sensitivity and the appreciation of music are enriched. Most remarkably,
the moderate user may awake refreshed after a deep restful sleep: GHB appears
temporarily to
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/ghbdop.htm">
       inhibit
      </a>
      dopamine-release while increasing storage, leading to the brightened mood
and sharpened mental focus of a subsequent "dopamine-rebound". GHB acts
both as a disinhibitor and an aphrodisiac. Intensity of
      <a href="https://www.sensualism.com/sex/orgasm.html">
       orgasm
      </a>
      is heightened.
Hence GHB is potentially useful in relieving the psychopathologies of prudery
and sexual repression. Unfortunately, its therapeutic
value has been eclipsed by its demonisation in the mass-media. Stories
of chaste virgins turning into sex-crazed nymphomaniacs make great copy
and poor scientific medicine. Moreover GHB is sometimes confused with the amnestic
"date-rape" benzodiazepine,
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/flunit.htm">
       flunitrazepam
      </a>
      - better-known as the potent and fast-acting sedative-hypnotic "forget pill",
Rohypnol. Bought on the street, GHB may be confused with all sorts of other
substances too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Yet even pure GHB is no magic
elixir. Not everyone likes it. GHB's psychological effects are unpredictable
and poorly understood. It has a relatively low therapeutic index. Nausea, dizziness, inco-ordination are common; reaction-time
is slowed. GHB does not usually promote great depth of thought. Its very
status as "an almost ideal sleep inducing-substance" makes it of limited
use to those who aspire instead to be more intensely
      <a href="https://www.modafinil.wiki/">
       awake
      </a>
      .
The lack of any discernible body-count to fuel the periodic moral panics
its use induces may allow a partial rehabilitation. Yet GHB evokes - at
best - only a faint, fleeting parody of the life-long

With that poker-faced Alice-In-Wonderland
logic popular amongst the world's sleazier governments, not merely do the
authorities preserve the legal status of cigarette sales here in the UK
on grounds of upholding personal liberty. The slickly expensive marketing
and glamorisation of
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/tobacco/index.html">
       tobacco
      </a>
      products to potential victims is sanctioned on similar grounds too. We ought
to be as shocked at tobacco promotion as we'd certainly feel if instead
the billboards urged kids to try
      <a href="https://www.opioids.com/heroin.html">
       heroin
      </a>
      because it's cool. Yet familiarity
breeds moral apathy. Youngsters are typically hooked before they are in
any position to make an informed choice of their preferred poison - or even to abstain altogether.
Meanwhile a state-supported export drive targets the poor in vulnerable
Third World countries. With a cynicism that almost beggars belief, one celebrated
British ex-Prime Minister accepted a million-dollar bribe from a leading
member of the drug-cartels for her services. Her party's Home
Secretary then delivered himself of blood-curdling calls for a crack-down
on

      So long as our governments

     ?
Have they potentially anything significant to add to most people's quality
of life? Official medical doctrine says
     <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/antidepressants/undepressed.html">
      no
     </a>
     . Allegedly, only sufferers from
clinically-sanctioned psychiatric disorders will benefit from such agents -
though in recent years it has at last been formally recognised that depressive
disorders are under-diagnosed and under-treated even by the early twenty-first century's
abjectly poor standards of acceptable

Most of humankind, however, still doesn't fit any of the official diagnostic
boxes. So can "diagnostic creep" triumph over therapeutic minimalism and enhance
our quality of life? Yes. Must the goal of pharmacotherapy be as limited

       glutamate
      </a>
      . The progress of molecular

      should eventually allow more targeted compounds to be developed. Ideally, these more

      is an anxiolytic 5-HT1A partial agonist too. Buspirone lacks the intellect-clouding
effects of other clinical and alcoholic anti-anxiety agents. It's not a muscle relaxant. It's only mildly sedating. Yet buspirone's weak
and equivocal effects on sub-types of dopamine function, while useful commercially for
the purposes of touting its lack of "abuse-potential",
mean buspirone isn't very exciting or popular. Crucially, unlike the benzodiazepines, it's not a fast-acting drug. Several weeks of use may pass before its

      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/mirtazap.html">
       imipramine
      </a>
      (Tofranil),
and their allies are relatives of the neuroleptic drug
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/neuroleptic.htm">
       chlorpromazine
      </a>
      .
Chlorpromazine is also known as Largactil, the notorious "chemical
cosh". Tricyclics block to varying degrees the reuptake of serotonin
and noradrenaline into the nerve cell terminals from where they are released. The consequent changes in pre- and post-synaptic receptor sensitivity may lighten the spirits of 60-70% of the depressives who take them.
Perhaps unsurprisingly given their parentage, the tricyclics are all dirty drugs,
though some are dirtier than others. Their
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/antichol.htm">
       anti-cholinergic
      </a>
      effects harm memory, concentration and intellectual performance. Their anti-histamine
action induces drowsiness and sedation. Their adverse effect on cardiac
function makes them dangerous in overdose. Most "euthymic" volunteers
on whom they have been tested don't like their dulling effects of consciousness.
Unlike chlorpromazine, the tricyclic antidepressants don't noticeably block
the
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/neuroleptics.htm">
       dopamine
      </a>
      receptors. But with one notable
      <a href="https://www.amineptine.com/">
       exception
      </a>
      ,
they do precious little to stimulate
      <a href="https://www.amineptine.com/dopam.htm">
       dopamine
      </a>
      function either. Hence they're not much fun even for the severely depressed
people who can benefit from taking them. For three decades they were the
mainstay of the treatment of clinically-acknowledged
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/resource/">
       depression
      </a>
      .
They contributed to the widely-held medical opinion that anything classed
as an antidepressant won't help "normal" people; unless of course
they were "really" depressed. Basically, tricyclics are cheap,
nasty and usually best avoided.

        Listening
to Prozac
       </a>

      . Kramer has written a remarkably honest book. It's a discursive
memoir by a therapist who is forced to admit that many of his clients seemed
rapidly to fare far better on a pill than on his industrial-strength regimen
of caring talk-therapy. Kramer's discussion of "cosmetic psychopharmacology"
and "designer personalities", however, enraged traditionalists.
For chemical Calvinist orthodoxy finds the notion that people should have
a right to choose pharmacologically who and what they want to be profoundly
offensive. In

        Second, though a few subjects may feel mildly euphoric, in other users
the SSRIs serve more as mood-stabilisers and mood-flatteners in their lives. By increasing the user's emotional self-sufficiency, too, SSRIs may

         change
        </a>
        the "balance of power" in personal relationships - for good or ill.
In some cases, SSRIs may even act as

         thymoanaesthetisers
        </a>

someone in the pit of unmitigated clinical depression. It is scarcely
a life-enriching property for "normal" people who lack any convenient
diagnostic category which acknowledges their malaise.

      This is really much more
fun than it sounds. Yet the socially responsible use of reward pathway enhancements/remedial therapies is a technical, bioethical and medico-legal minefield. In the late twentieth century, experimental evidence persuaded many - but not all - investigators that the mesolimbic dopamine system serves
as the

       final common pathway
      </a>

      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/melser.htm">

      and

      </a>
      have attracted
the fiercest rival partisans in antidepressant research. "Dopaminergic" (and opioid) agents, by contrast,
are suspect. They are politically incorrect since they are potentially "abusable".
Moreover it can be argued that the research and development of safe and sustainable

      is at least as morally urgent as the license of safe and sustainable euphoriants. At

Even better, whereas some dopaminergics are potentially

     <p>
      So what are the other contemporary
options for chemical life-enhancement?
     </p>
     <p>
      METHYLPHENIDATE (RITALIN); MINAPRINE (CANTOR); NOMIFENSINE (MERITAL)
      <br/>
      An SSRI can be
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/methyl.htm">
       combined
      </a>
      ("augmented" sounds more soothing to the official medical ear) with a dopaminergic
such as
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/methcomp.htm">
       methylphenidate
      </a>
      .
As
      <a href="https://www.amphetamines.org/methylphenidate/ritalinkid.html">
       Ritalin
      </a>
      , methylphenidate is prolifically dispensed to American
schoolchildren for
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/adhd.htm">
       different
      </a>
      purposes altogether. It is sometimes abused as an instrument of social control. In spite of its structural relationship to amphetamine,
methylphenidate resembles in many ways a more benign version of
      <a href="https://www.erythroxylum-coca.com/refs/index.html">
       cocaine
      </a>
      ,
yet with a much longer half-life. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of, but doesn't significantly
release, the catecholamines noradrenaline and dopamine. If it is taken in sustained-release
form or combined with an
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/fluox.htm">
       SSRI
      </a>
      ,
all of which have
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/ocd.htm">
       anti-

      <a href="https://www.nootropic.com/methylphenidate/index.html">

     </a>
     strategy for a second messenger rather than a neurotransmitter in the search
for long-term mood-brightening agents. Inositol and its derivatives serve
as messenger molecules within the nervous system. The molecule itself is a
naturally occurring isomer of glucose. It is a key intermediate of the phosphatidyl-inositol
cycle. This is a second-messenger system used by several noradrenergic, serotonergic
and cholinergic receptors. Adult westerners typically consume about one gram
of inositol per day in their food. The richest dietary sources are fruits,
nuts, beans and grains. The mood-darkening ("stabilising") effect
of

Potentially, if taken in high doses, inositol seems to be a good way of lightening
the spirits and diminishing anxiety in "euthymic" and depressed people alike.
Dosages of even 50g and more reportedly produce no toxic side-effects. This
regimen shouldn't be attempted unsupervised by people with a history of

      were
not merely cured of their tuberculosis. They became exceptionally happy
as well. The animated enthusiasm for life of a previously crotchety bunch
of old soldiers disconcerted their doctors. For it transpired that their new-found euphoria
wasn't just an understandable reaction to being cured of physical disease.
MAOIs typically have mood-brightening properties as well. At the time, there
was no accepted and clinically effective treatment for depression. Fortunately,
via the usual circuitous routes, the appropriate lessons were eventually
drawn. Many millions of people were successfully treated with MAOIs in consequence.

they still haven't fully recovered. The older non-selective

      Whatever the full explanation,

life-expectancy, of rats at least, by

       10
mg
      </a>
      or below daily, deprenyl retains its selectivity for the type-B MAO iso-enzyme.
At MAO-B-selective dosages, deprenyl doesn't provoke the "cheese-effect"; tyramine is also
broken down by MAO type-A. Deprenyl isn't addictive, which probably reflects
its different delivery-mechanism and delayed reward compared to inhaled
tobacco smoke. In November 2004, Yale University researchers launched a
      <a href="https://www.selegiline.com/article/smokers.html">

      of deprenyl for smokers who want to quit tobacco. Whether the Government would welcome the billions of pounds
of lost revenue and a swollen population of energetic non-taxpayers that
a switch in people's MAOI habits might entail is unclear.

       increases
      </a>
      trace amines, modulates phospholipid metabolism
and up-regulates GABA(B) receptors. In fact, its nicest effects, as for all of
the compounds cited here, will vary in nature and extent from person to
person. To some extent, optimal dosage and long-term drug-regimen of choice
can be discovered only by (cautious) empirical self-investigation.

      . Yet frequently and
perversely, the more hazardous the drug, then the easier it is to get hold
of in our society. The carcinogenic cocktail that carries off more people
than all other toxins combined can be purchased quite legally and effortlessly
at any tobacconist or newsagent. Obtaining the less lethal - but scarcely socially
desirable - street

      </a>
      requires a little more exertion. Yet they can still be readily purchased
in pubs and clubs in all the big towns and cities. Many of the more beneficent
drugs discussed here, on the other hand, are unlicensed, "investigational", or available on a prescription-only
basis. They're not illegal to possess. But they are hard to obtain
short of visiting countries where they're available over-the-counter or
using

      </a>
      of uncertain reputation.

     <p>
      If the central principle
at stake here were the preservation of a drug-free society, then some sort of
totalitarian (or, more euphemistically, paternalistic) argument could be
cobbled together for violating personal freedom so oppressively. Yet that's
rarely the issue. For in most cases, the issue effectively amounts, not
to drugs or no drugs, but to allowing people the choice to opt for
      <i>
       better
      </i>
      ones. Perhaps 80% of the population in Western countries currently drink ethyl

      .
Often they do both. Whether viewed in terms of mortality, morbidity or overall
quality of life, we'd be better off if we
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/selfmed.htm">
       switched
      </a>
      to enhancing receptor sub-type selective dopaminergic, opioidergic, serotonergic and cholinergic function by the

be legally robbed of the right to do so.

     <p>
      This freedom of choice
isn't conventional wisdom. It will be suggested that the level of medical
expertise required to make informed choices exceeds that of the average
layperson. A quasi-priestly medical caste wielding the power of the prescription-pad
would doubtless wish to keep it that way. But the intrinsic difficulty and

it's far more interesting to study something palpably relevant to one's

of an education system geared to schooling people in, and for,

       ketamine
      </a>
      . Ketamine is better known as a dissociative anaesthetic and painkiller. Taken at around a tenth of the anaesthetic dose, ketamine rapidly lifts "mental” pain too. Dosing can be repeated every three or four days as needed. A non-invasive nasal spray is a convenient home alternative to intravenous infusion. Higher dosing may increase efficacy and side-effects. Between 65% and 75% of even "treatment-resistant" depressives report rapid and sustained mood relief. Ketamine and its active metabolite
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/hydroxynorketamine.pdf">
       hydroxynorketamine
      </a>
      also banishes anxiety, intrusive traumatic memories and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Ketamine's primary target is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. NMDA is a glutamate receptor and ion channel protein critical to synaptic plasticity, memory function and abstract thought. Ketamine has weak agonistic effects on
      <i>
       mu
      </i>
      opioid receptors, but any acutely enjoyable opioidergic action cannot explain ketamine’s sustained mood-brightening effect. Longer-term down-regulation of depressogenic
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/ketamine-cytokines.pdf">
       cytokines
      </a>
      probably plays a role in mood improvement. So does ketamine-induced increased production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/ketamine-bdnf.pdf">
       BDFN
      </a>

      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/ketamine-bdnf.pdf">
       dopamine

      release. Other researchers speculate that signalling via the
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/hydroxyketamine-ampa.pdf">
       AMPA
      </a>
      glutamate receptor is key, mediated via ketamine's metabolite hydroxynorketamine. At present, neuroscience does not understand the downstream
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/ketamine-mechs.pdf">
       signalling cascade
      </a>
      that explains ketamine’s therapeutic action, when it works. But used responsibly - and ideally under medical supervision - low-dose ketamine is a comparatively safe and effective mood-brightener.
     </p>
     <p>
      One pitfall with ketamine is transient "dissociative reactions". Full-blown out-of-body experiences are rare at the low therapeutic dose. Yet most depressives don't want to become psychonauts in any shape or form, just feel well. Another glutamate-modulating option is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apimostinel" target="_blank">
       apimostinel
      </a>
      , the orally active analogue of
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5327451/" target="_blank">
       rapastinel
      </a>
      . Apimostinel and rapastinel are glyxins - allosteric modulators of the glycine site of the NMDA receptor that typically lack ketamine's acute "psychotomimetic" effects. Both apimostinel and rapastinel are fast-acting, pain-killing, mood-brightening, neuroprotective smart drugs. Normally, neither apimostinel and rapastinel make users feel weird. Large, well-controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm encouraging early results. For a useful list of therapeutic mood-brighteners under commercial development, see Wikipedia's

       human
      </a>
      ".
     </p>
     <p>
      The rot goes deeper.
      <a href="http://www.selfishness.com/index.html">
       Selfish DNA
      </a>
      can count
on innumerable dupes to act as its distal representatives even today as the biotech revolution unfolds. The
need for "character-building" emotional pain gets justified with all manner
of sophistries, both religious and profane.
      <a href="https://www.abolitionist.com/suffering.html">
       Suffering
      </a>
      is good for you, one
may be told. It's all part of life's rich tapestry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Actually, suffering exists only because it was
good for our
      <a href="https://www.biopsychiatry.com/depression/index.html">
       genes
      </a>
      . Conditionally-activated negative emotions were fitness-enhancing in the ancestral environment.
In the current era, apologists for mental pain are serving as the innocent mouthpieces of the
nasty bits of code which spawned them. If pressed, primordial DNA's unwitting spokesmen
would presumably disavow any such connection. Yet if one were
      <i>
       purposely
      </i>
      building an intelligent robotic survival-machine, then endowing it with
the illusion of
      <a href="https://www.abolitionist.com/anti-natalism.html">
       free-will
      </a>
      would prove a highly fitness-enhancing adaptation.
It's a trick which our genes stumbled upon; and then blindly exploited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fortunately, over the
next few centuries humanity will be able to outwit its ancient
      <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/heaven/heaven6.htm">
       genetic
masters
      </a>
      . Our present status as
      <a href="https://www.supercentenarian.com/ageing.html">
       throwaway
      </a>
      genetic vehicles will finally
be
      <a href="https://www.supercentenarian.com/archive/eternal-life.html">
       subverted
      </a>
      . When gradients of heavenly well-being become the genetically
      <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/hedab.htm">
       predestined
      </a>
      norm of mental health, then the very notion of tampering with our new-won
"natural" condition and feeling "drugged" may come
to seem immoral. It may also seem perverse. Why should anyone want to contaminate
the divine ecstasy of their spirituo-biological soul-stuff with chemical
pollutants? No thanks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today's twisted victims
of the primordial genetic code, on the other hand, view the notion of sullying
their
      <a href="https://www.wireheading.com/">
       natural
      </a>
      state of being through
psychoactive drugs with a much more deep-seated
      <a href="https://www.utilitarianism.com/biotech.html">
       ambivalence
      </a>
      . They adopt it as a near-universal
practice. Given the inadequacy of the third-rate pharmacological stopgaps on offer, and
the lack of any serious drug-education, it's scarcely surprising we're so poor
at using them. Thus concerned parents are surely right to worry about the
trashy street drugs taken by their kids. Early in the 21st Century, "Just Say No"
      <i>
       is
      </i>
      frequently still a good rule-of-thumb. Yet with the right new
      <a href="https://www.huxley.net/index.html">
       genes
      </a>
      and
      <a href="https://www.mdma.net/index.html">
       designer-drugs
      </a>
      , there's no reason why mature

      shouldn't just get

and better
