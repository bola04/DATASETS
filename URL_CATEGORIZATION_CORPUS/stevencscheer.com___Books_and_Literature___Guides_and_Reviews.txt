        A hearty welcome to all visitors and readers to this site. Students as well as all those who feel that we are
never too old to learn something new, or to re-learn what we may have forgotten with the passage
of time.

       During my long teaching career I was often told, both by my students and by my colleagues, that I was very helpful
to them. I hope I can still be helpful to you, my visitors and readers. It will, of course, be up to you to decide this.
Should you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me. I have been known to give helpful responses to students as
well as to others who have contacted me in the past.(For your convenience, my e-mail address is listed on every page
in this Web site. Usually at the top, in the left-hand column, and always at the bottom of each page.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I sincerely hope that you will find most of what is here enjoyable and entertaining as well as informative and insightful. 
Pick and choose to your heart's content. I can also recommend the new casino sites
       <a href="http://www.newcasinosites.org/">
        listings on this website
       </a>
       . And visit again and again. There is a lot to read here, too much for any one 
session. So I hope to see you more than once.
      </p>

       On a perhaps deeper level, I wish to dedicate this site to the love of words 
that both writers and readers share. 
Words embody our thoughts and express our feelings. They convey what we think and feel 
and know. They reveal who we are,
both to the world and to ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       My aim is to share with all my readers and visitors to this site samples from my work - past, present, and future. 
I have many interests, as the samples here included should indicate (and they don't represent all my interests). Some 
of the samples are fairly long (formal lectures, in some cases), while others are short (and perhaps sweet). Whatever I 
write, I write from the heart as well as from the head. And my aim is always to promote those values which are truly 
worthy of our collective humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Web site is also dedicated to the art of thinking, and to reading and writing, as well as to an 
abiding love of movies, particularly as this is reflected in the samples from
       <i>
        <b>
         Hollywood Values
        </b>
       </i>
       .

that this is a print-on-demand book. Such books sometimes show up in their computers as out-of-print books.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site also contains essays on literary criticism, as well as thoughts on the teaching of reading
 and writing and critical thinking (some of which were previously published). I also include papers on English and American and 
Hungarian literature, and literature in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will also find a number of book reviews here, 
some of which originally appeared in the
       <b>
        Bay Review
       </b>
       , an online journal no longer
in existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep some samples from my poetry and fiction on this site as well.Then there is the section
called
       <b>
        Controversies Now and Then
       </b>
       . This deals with issues I feel strongly about. These include attempts by 
various groups to censor the wonderful Harry Potter books or, more recently, the unduly harsh treatment accorded 
to Martha Stewart a while back. Of course, as we all know by now, she is free once more and is back to give us new lessons 
in cooking, etc. Good for her! I don't know what else I'll be adding to this section. It all depends on what comes down 
the pike.
