The main text is a simple picture book story for young readers about a bison calf born on the American Prairie Reserve in Montana. The story is augmented by sidebars for older readers, including adults, amplifying the imformation about the prairie and about bison themselves. It's really a book for the whole family, showing what a beautiful and amazing habitat the prairie can be.

I enjoyed tagging along as they traveled from one osprey nest to another, gently removing chicks to take blood samples in order to measure their heavy metal content. Starting in the late 1800s, Butte, MT, at the headwaters of the Clark Fork River, was the largest copper mine in the U.S. The major results of the mining was two-foldï¿½the electrification of America and the largest Superfund cleanup site in the U.S. I love being part of the Scientists in the Field series, as its books are wholistic. ï¿½Call of the Ospreyï¿½ deals not only with current research but also with the history of Butte and the lives of the scientists involved in the research.

           I loved writing this book, which describes the positive changes in the ecology of the park that are happening since the wolves came back--healthier willows, more beavers and small predators, more song birds, and more. Wolves have also returned to several western states around Yellowstone, including Montana, and their presence there is also helping restore the natural environment.

           While it was a difficult book to write in some ways, I focused my energy and attention on the fact that the most important job of these dogs is to save lives, not only the lives of their handlers and other members of the patrol but also of innocent civilians who share the roads and pathways of countries like Afghanistan with the military.

           This book was truly a labor of love and respect. Within a few years of acquiring horses after the Spanish brought them to America, Indians became among the greatest horsmen in the world and created vibrant new horse-related aspects to their cultures. I wanted to communicate these achievements to young people and to show them that despite all they have suffered at the hands of European American culture, the Indians heart and soul attachment to horses endures.

           "This polished photo-essay by frequent collaborators Patent and Muñoz will tug at the heartstrings of readers--especially those sympathetic to the plight of the often-maligned pit bull. In cogent, conversational prose, the author chronicles the rehabilitation journey of one of the dogs rescued in 2007 from NFL quarterback Michael Vick's illegal dogfighting operation."

           Bill Muñoz and I had a great time visiting Audie and his family, Linda, Bill, and his canine brother, Aldo, in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also got to meet many wonderful people and dogs associated with

            BAD RAP

           (Bay Area Dogowners Responsible About Pitbulls). This organization played key roles in giving the vicitims of Vick's operation a chance to become members of loving, caring families. And with the precedent set by that case, vicitims of other dog fighting rings now have the same hope.

           In addition to being an author, I love to share what I’ve learned about writing with children, fellow writers, and the public. I’ve been a featured speaker at many conferences and schools, and I’ve taught nuts and bolts workshops on writing for children, as well as sessions on freeing the creative spirit from the restraints of the internal critic. I also work as a consultant with less experienced writers, helping them hone their work to make it more publishable.

           My home in Missoula, Montana, sits on a half acre of land on a plateau next to Blue Mountain, with the Missoula Valley and the mountains beyond visible from our windows. Sometimes the mountains are obscured by beautiful clouds.

           combines these two loves as I recount the history of the relationship between Plains Indian tribes and the American bison over the thousands of years they have shared our planet, with help from photographer William Muñoz and historical artwork. School Library Journal says in its starred review, “
           <em>
            Patent’s narrative is clear and her writing is almost lyrical
           </em>
           ,” while Booklist’s starred review points out,
           <em>
            “The lucid narrative and spacious book design....will draw readers into the history and the science and prompt discussion of human and animal rights and the connections between them.”
           </em>
           The book was chosen to represent Montana in the National Book Festival in Washington,D.C. for 2006 and has been chosen by the Mountain and Plains Independent Booksellers as a winner in the children’s catagory for 2007. The book was a work from the heart, both for me and for photographer Bill Muñoz, so we feel especially honored to receive this recognition.
