                            professional experience.  It is very rewarding to be the "feet on the ground" at hearings for 
                            Claimants.  Claimants appreciate someone local to lean on for support; and I completely appreciated 
                            the fact that I can always rely on Assure for well developed, accessible information regarding each 
                            of the hearings I attend. "

                            Social Security Disability claimants at a critical moment in their lives brings personal rewards 
                            in that I am using my experience and abilities to help those in need.  The situations that I have 
                            encountered through working with Assure Disability have opened my eyes in many ways. As an attorney, 
                            the experience in working with Assure Disability has been invaluable. "
