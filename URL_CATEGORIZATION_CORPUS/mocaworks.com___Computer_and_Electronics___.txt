      Inreasing Efficiency and Communication with Knowledge Vault

      <div class="e1">
       The success of KnowledgeVault rests on four key pillars - Knowledge Management with Knowledge Objects, Secure, Social Business, Modern Learning Management, and Everything Everywhere. The integration of any one of them into a company or organization can be a powerful change agent, but taken together, they can be revolutionary. To borrow an overused buzz phrase, KnowledgeVault literally puts everyone "on the same page."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here's how it works:

        Knowledge Management with Knowledge Objects
       </div>
       Knowledge Objects are searchable files that everyone can see. They might be text documents or photographs or charts or even rich media files, like audio or video. They can be amended by anyone with access. Knowledge Objects evolve with each change, rather than splitting into a confusing pile of versions.

       Social Business means you're connecting colleagues and coworkers across departments, across geography, or across the hall. Collaborate with a pre-determined group of participants and watch your project move forward as multiple team members can impart spin and report progress in real time.

        The resulting efficiency reduces iterative friction and keeps the important information at the fingertips of everyone who needs it, and no one who doesn't. KnowledgeVault turns challenges into teachable moments and keeps archiving easy in both directions. It creates a whole new, highly intuitive flow. So you can spend your business time running your business.

       Our unique Knowledge Object storage method allows you to accurately share and manage documents across an organization. Every file uploaded into the KnowledgeVault, whether it's a PowerPoint, Word document, PDF, video file, etc., is saved as a Knowledge Object. Each Object is searchable and reusable in a multitude of ways. Once in place, Knowledge Objects can be shared with other members, or with other teams of people. When the Knowledge Object is updated with a new or older version of a file all of the shared locations are automatically updated because they point to the "Object" not an individual file.

       Knowledge Objects make updating an existing file quick and easy. Simply upload the new document into KnowledgeVault and everywhere that your original Knowledge Object is used, the new document is presented in its place. The vault also automatically stores all previous versions of the Knowledge Object so you can easily revert to any previous versions.

       </div>
       The American Business Woman's Association (ABWA) is the largest group of its kind in America. With over 200 chapters nationwide, they have a 60-year history of providing business education and networking opportunities to female business owners.
                        Yet, they were still disseminating information via printing and distributing bulky ring binders to chapter managers, who would then share that information with other members.
                        The ABWA recognized a need to change the way they communicated, engaged and trained their members.

      <div class="e3">

        Intervention:
       </div>
       The ABWA implemented KnowledgeVault across their entire organization. Now, information is delivered directly to the user, and the information goes system-wide the moment it's shared.
                        KnowledgeVault has eliminated the need to print and ship most materials. The private mail, instant chat and team board features have created a secure community, and training is now delivered and tracked virtually.
                        ABWA also takes advantage of KnowledgeVault's Survey Engine and uses it to survey their members immediately after hosting an event to garner feedback that can be beneficial for learning and lanning for other events.

       They started Lightspeed Learning because no comprehensive LMS (Learning Management System) existed at the time and they recognized the value in e-learning and blended e-learning as a tool for business.

       Lightspeed Learning quickly exceeded Mike and Oca's high hopes.
