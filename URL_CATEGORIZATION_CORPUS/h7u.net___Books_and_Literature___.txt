           Importance of Engaging With People on Your Website Through Pictures And Infographics
          </p>
          <p>
           Many People risk losing their site visitors despite the high quality and the value of their site content. If your site visitors are not engaging with your website, that means, your site is not providing any cost or benefit, which automatically defeats the purpose of your site. Every website owner needs to ensure that their website visitors’ are adequately engaged because therein lies the path to sustained visitor return rate.
           <br/>
           Humans are visual beings. The psychologist, Albert Mehrabian once said that 93% of all communication is nonverbal. He believed that what we see has a profound effect on what we do, how we feel, and who we are. The implication here is that how you use graphics significantly affect how much people come and stay on your site.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            What are Infographics?
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Infographics are the creative and illustrative depiction of what you are trying to convey. Creatives and infographics include elements like charts, colors, images and graphs. They all tell your story so that the target audience can easily understand you.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Website Engagement with conversion optimization
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Yes, getting people to visit your site is essential, it isn’t the key to building a tremendous go-to website. “Content is king” is a favorite and overused phrase, but if the content is what gets you noticed, engagement is what announces that you are here to stay – convincing website visitors to settle down and enjoy what you have to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Infographics and Website Engagement
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Internet is a visual platform, so it isn’t surprising that infographics can reach millions and keep them adequately engaged. According to Bell Pottinger, a marketing company, 2013 had a 55% increase in business budgets for digital items like infographics.
           <br/>
           It is therefore essential for smart website owners to find out why infographics and pictures are so relevant when it comes to engaging site visitors.
           <br/>
           Importance of Engaging Website Visitors through Pictures and Infographics
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            • Digital Marketing incorporates the human factor with Infographics
           </strong>
           <br/>
           Humans now generally have less attention span. Infographics combat this by matching text with visuals in the right proportion because visuals take less time and mental energy to process. Website infographics and picture contents are often used to explain difficult concepts and assist people in making decisions. Also, Infographics often appeal to one’s emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
           • It is a confirmed attention grabber
           <br/>
           A very popular saying goes thus; “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Pictures and infographic create the first impression, captures the attention and engages your visitor to read and participate in what you’ve got going on, on your site. A great picture and infographic with the proper ratio of text to visuals could richly determine the impression and reach of your content.
          </p>
          <p>
           • It increases visitor return rate
           <br/>
           This is one of the most significant importance of infographics and pictures to website engagement. Nielson/Norman Group estimates that the average page visit lasts under a minute. Unless you grab the visitor’s interest, such visitor will only take a look at your page and move on to the next site.
           <br/>
           Website visitors usually browse the internet for information and news. Utilizing visual representation of data means your site visitors can skim your infographic, get the information required and then stay a bit longer to check out what else you have to offer, or may they may even bookmark your site for later use.
          </p>
          <p>
           • It is an important determinant of viral content with long lifespan
           <br/>
           An excellent infographic or picture could be re-shared for years after its creation. The high readability and the visual attractiveness of infographics make them accessible to a larger pool of people and more likely to be shared.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to recent research, a single infographic has the potential to reach as many as 15 million Internet users.
           <br/>
           Effective site engagement is more than just an aesthetically pleasing website. Website owners must consider all aspects of the infographic and picture content, from the color and screen resolution to accessibility requirements, to excite, inspire and most importantly, engage their site visitors.

            1. Repair versus Upgrading costs
           </strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
           If you’re dealing with severe AC damages, one thing that’s probably unavoidable is high repair costs. It’s costly to replace dehumidifiers and thermostats, especially in commercial buildings. In addition to replacing faulty components, one also needs a plumber to replace the pipes after the AC repair.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nowadays, various electronic manufacturers are steadily releasing low-energy consumption air conditioning systems priced competitively. Rather than spend thousands of dollars on repairing an AC that’s on its last leg, you’ll save much more by replacing it with a new one.
          </p>
          <h2>
           <strong>
            2. Condition of the AC unit
           </strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
           There are two major advantages of purchasing a brand new AC unit. Unlike a second-hand buyer, you receive a warranty that assures you of free repairs as provided by the manufacturer’s terms and conditions. In addition to the warranty, the buyer is confident that they can use the new AC system for at least a decade.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand, purchasing a second-hand AC unit comes with a share of uncertainties. If the AC system is more than 5 years old, you’ll spend a significant sum of money replacing aged components. Your AC repair Bluffton SC may recommend purchasing a new AC if your system belongs to a past decade.

            After finding out what your lease will involve, you should try and find out the special deals that are being offered on the Honda Accord.

            When leasing any vehicle, it is crucial that you find out the value of the car you intend to lease. Having a rough estimate of the car’s value will help you negotiate effectively. You will be able to get a lease deal that is not exaggerated.

However, if this is not achievable, your sales representative will be able to come up with a plan that is comfortable for you.

             Asphalt paving contractors in Frederick charge almost the same fees for asphalt paving. The cost varies slightly from one contractor to the other. This also applies to the quality of the work delivered. Before you finalize your choice of paving contractor, try to get quotations from different contractors. As much as the cost is an important factor, do not base your final decision on it. Other factors should also be allowed to determine your final decision.

This will save you from unnecessary disappointment at a later stage.

             You should also make certain that your asphalt contractor is ready to sign written contracts for the job stating the deliverables and the duration of the work. If they are trying to evade written contracts, then it is an indication that you should look for an alternative contractor.

             Do not rush to pick your asphalt paving contractor. Waiting until you are under pressure to pick a contractor will make you make bad decisions. Take your time and come up with a good decision for both the contractor and you.

             Does your asphalt paving contractor own all the required paving equipment to deliver the best quality work? It is important to make use of the latest equipment available in the paving industry. Lack of appropriate equipment will result in poor quality work. You should not, therefore, make it a point to ensure that you are dealing with a company that is well equipped.

Therefore, it is up to you to find the best service provider in the region so that the driveways or the other asphalt installations last long.

            During winter, whenever the weather conditions turn chilly you close your house to avoid the cold. Closing your house leads to stagnant air getting trapped inside the house. Indoor heating and air conditioning units such as humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ventilators and air purifiers can help solve this problem by eliminating the polluted air. This will improve your indoor comfort and can be done with a single installation. Here are a few ways you can benefit from having

            Instagram is unique among the social media platforms in that it mainly focuses on pictures and visual content. While Twitter primarily uses text, and Facebook tries to incorporate as much as they can into their newsfeed, Instagram’s main focus is photos, and now, short videos. Social media marketers must approach Instagram marketing keeping in mind how visually orientated the platform is. The following are 3 tips for getting started marketing through Instagram presented by

          <p class="p2">
           <span class="s1">
            The first tip may seem obvious: Instagram is a photo sharing platform, so it stands to reason extra care and attention should be placed on whatever photo you share. However, before you go spending all your time shooting and editing photos, keep in mind the particulars of the formatting Instagram users. For starters, the photo ratio of Instagram works better with square photos then it does with landscape photos. You do have resizing options with Instagram, however, photos that are too vertical or horizontal may not fit properly into Instagram’s photo frame. Keep in mind the use of Instagram filters as well. An ordinary photo can have some cool effects added simply by selecting one of Instagram’s preprogrammed filters.

          <p class="p2">
           <span class="s1">
            Instagram offers more ways to engage than just static photos and text. Much like Facebook, you can post videos that appear right in a user’s feed. These videos stand out from the pack and is a great way to attract attention even in a crowded newsfeed. But it doesn’t stop there. Instagram has a newly introduced feature called Stories, that allow you to add a sequence of photos or short videos that will appear right at the top of people’s feeds. These stories are meant to disappear in a day, similar to how Snapchat works. Because of these stories position in the top of the news feed, they have high visibility. In fact, since its introduction, the Instagram Story feature has become an immediate hit, even enough to rival Snapchat. Much like the photo filters Instagram offers, there are additional editing tools, such as placing test in videos, which give you more usability and ways to be creative.

           <span class="s1">
            Instagram marketing is more than just increasing your followers; you can use it to get real world conversions. To do this, make sure to add a link that will funnel users directly to where you want them to go, whether it be a landing page, sign up form, or just your website. One easy way to do this is used place the link in your Instagram bio section. This way you can use multiple pictures to advertise the same link. One thing you can do to make your links more attractive is to use an URL shorten to condense the link so it doesn’t look like a string of text. Likewise, links can be placed in the video description, or as a follow-up comment in your video posting. Never underestimate the power of a strategically placed link. Overall, remember that with Instagram the use is all on smartphones. So make sure that all the links you include go to a page that is optimized for mobile viewing.

            Instagram is a sometimes overlooked social marketing tool. However, the Instagram user base has continued to grow, and they have been able to avoid losing users with the additional of new features like Instagram Story. A successful social media strategy will involve using as many channels as you can to reach users!
