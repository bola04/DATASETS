          The Art and Science of Hand Reading: Classical Methods for 
			Self-Discovery through Palmistry
         </a>
         by Ellen Goldberg, Dorian 
			Bergen (Destiny Books) In this comprehensive guide to hand reading, 
			based on Ellen Goldberg’s 40 years of teaching palmistry and the 
			Western Mystery tradition, the authors make the powerful insights of 
			the hand accessible in an inviting and user-friendly manner. The 
			book presents the character traits and personality archetypes 
			associated with each of the seven mounts of the palm and shows how 
			to determine which are most influential in the nature of the 
			individual. The mount archetypes reveal the lifestyle, love, sex, 
			and marriage preferences; the best career choices; and the unique 
			strengths and weaknesses for each person. The book also examines 
			other factors that enhance the qualities revealed by the mount 
			types, including the flexibility of the hand, texture of the skin, 
			and the shapes of the fingers, fingertips, and nails. The meaning of 
			each major and minor line is described in detail as well as the 
			influence the person’s own mind has in healing defects and obstacles 
			found on their lines. The authors also provide accurate timing 
			guides for each line, making it possible to locate specific events 
			and to see how your lines change over time.
         <o:p>
         </o:p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Palmistry is a science and a universal language. The hand tells a 
			story about your talents, relationships, health, and how you feel 
			about yourself. It reveals periods of ease or challenge in your 
			life, and it speaks about your weaknesses and the traits you need to 
			develop. As you change, so do your hands, reflecting the progress 
			you have made.
         <o:p>
         </o:p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Presenting the hand as a guide to self-fulfillment, The Art and 
			Science of Hand Reading incorporates correspondences to other 
			mystical sciences such as astrology, Kabbalah, the Hermetic 
			teachings, and archetypal psychology. It also includes practical 
			examples and more than 600 illustrations to show how to integrate 
			the meanings of each part of the hand to form a complete picture of 
			your inner psychology and your ever-changing destiny.

         </a>
         landmark work of 
				20th century thought which established Hans Georg-Gadamer as one 
				of the most important philosophical voices of the 20th Century. 
				In this book, Gadamer established the field of ‘philosophical 
				hermeneutics': exploring the nature of knowledge, the book 
				rejected traditional quasi-scientific approaches to establishing 
				cultural meaning that were prevalent after the war. In arguing 
				the ‘truth' and ‘method' acted in opposition to each other, 
				Gadamer examined the ways in which historical and cultural 
				circumstance fundamentally influenced human understanding. It 
				was an approach that would become hugely influential in the 
				humanities and social sciences and remains so to this day in the 
				work of Jürgen Habermas and many others.

          The Unity of Linguistic Meaning
         </a>
         by John Collins 
			(University of Oxford Press) The problem of the unity of the proposition is almost as old as 
				philosophy itself, and was one of the central themes of early 
				analytical philosophy, greatly exercising the minds of Frege, 
				Russell, Wittgenstein, and Ramsey. The problem is how 
				propositions or meanings can be simultaneously unities (single 
				things) and complexes, made up of parts that are autonomous of 
				the positions they happen to fill in any given proposition. The 
				problem has been associated with numerous paradoxes and has 
				motivated general theories of thought and meaning, but has 
				eluded any consensual resolution; indeed, the problem is 
				sometimes thought to be wholly erroneous, a result of atomistic 
				assumptions we should reject. In short, the problem has been 
				thought to be of merely historical interest. Collins argues that 
				the problem is very real and poses a challenge to any theory of 
				linguistic meaning. He seeks to resolve the problem by laying 
				down some minimal desiderata on a solution and presenting a 
				uniquely satisfying account. The first part of the book surveys 
				and rejects extant 'solutions' and dismissals of the problem 
				from (especially) Frege and Russell, and a host of more 
				contemporary thinkers, including Davidson and Dummett. The 
				book's second part offers a novel solution based upon the 
				properties of a basic syntactic principle called 'Merge', which 
				may be said to create objects inside objects, thus showing how 
				unities can be both single things but also made up of proper 
				parts. The solution is defended from both philosophical and 
				linguistic perspectives. The overarching ambition of the book, 
				therefore, is to strengthen the ties between current linguistics 
				and contemporary philosophy of language in a way that is 
				genuinely sensitive to the history of both fields.

          Discernment of Spirits: Assessing Visions &amp; Visionaries in the Late

         </a>
         <span>
          by Wendy Love Anderson
         </span>
         (Spatmittelalter, 
			Humanismus, Reformation: Mohr Siebeck) argues for continuity between 
			thirteenth-century debates over visionary Franciscan clerics and 
			fifteenth-century debates over visionary lay women. More generally, 
			I will argue for a visionary discourse about the discernment of 
			spirits throughout the late Middle Ages, that is, not only a 
			forward-looking discourse but a discourse in which many of the 
			participants either experienced revelations and other special 
			spiritual gifts or were reputed by contemporaries to have done so. 
			Academically trained theologians who wrote about the discernment of 
			spirits also wrote about "mystical" theology; authors of saints' 
			lives described their own visions of the prospective saints; 
			preachers and confessors alluded to their own spiritual consolations 
			while offering guidance to visionaries they encountered on a daily 
			basis. Some female visionaries — Birgitta of Sweden prominent among 
			them — could and did contribute to this discourse, which remained 
			relatively egalitarian until the fifteenth century. In other words, 
			there was no absolute distinction between the "visionary" and the 
			"examiner" until the very end of the period in question. What 
			preoccupied these men and women was not gender, but authority: they 
			sought to define, regulate, or justify their own or their 
			companions' religiously based claims to influence the direction of 
			late medieval Christendom. Their efforts turned to writing about the 
			discernment of spirits at precisely those historical moments when 
			the Church's authority structures were being called into question 
			(as, indeed, they frequently were during this period). And the 
			precise details of those historical moments had considerable and 
			demonstrable impact on the texts that grew out of them. It is for 
			just that reason that Anderson has also focused on examining 
			writings about the discernment of spirits within their historical 
			contexts, a practice which throws the idiosyncratic details of each 
			text into the sharpest possible relief and avoids the temptation of 
			lumping too many disparate formulations into a vaguely understood 
			"discourse."

          Geomancy in Theory and Practice
         </a>
         by Stephen Skinner (Golden Hoard Press) Geomancy - divination by earth - ranks alongside the 
					tarot, astrology and the I Ching as a major form of 
					divination. Since the Renaissance it has largely fallen out 
					of favour for want of a generally available book on its 
					practice. This is the first and most comprehensive book in 
					English to cover the full historical background and practice 
					of divinatory geomancy, and will therefore be invaluable to 
					all those interested in geomancy, divination, and astrology. 
					It is the only complete history in any language, covering 
					geomancy's various manifestations in different cultures, as 
					well as being a practical manual showing how to cast and 
					interpret geomantic figures.
         <br/>
         Drawing on material from Latin, French, German and Arabic 
					sources, Stephen Skinner explores the roots of geomancy in 
					the Islamic raml divination of northern Africa, which lead 
					to Fa, IA and voodoo divinatory practices on the West Coast 
					and sikidy in Madagascar.
         <br/>
         He examines the impact Islamic geomancy had on medieval 
					Europe, where it rose to prominence and became, after 
					astrology, the prime method of divination. The part it 
					played in Renaissance thinking and in the great astrological 
					revival of the nineteenth century is followed by an 
					examination of its use in the Hermetic Order of the Golden 
					Dawn and its declining influence in the twentieth century, 
					only to be revived again in the last two decades.
         <br/>
         The second section of the book is concerned with the 
					practice, manipulation and generation of geomantic figures 
					as standardized in Europe, and gives practical examples as a 
					guide to the interpretation and practice of the art. It also 
					covers astrogeomany which uses the Houses of astrology in 
				geomancy.There is really no better work in English on the history 
				and the direct practice of geomancy. It is a definite supplement 
				to astrological practice and can be 
				adapted to the 16 court cards of the 
				tarot as a subsystem of divining.

          Ancient Egyptian Demonology. Studies on the Boundaries between the 
		Demonic and the Divine in Egyptian Magic
         </a>
         by P. Kousoulis
		(Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta: Peeters)
						In the Egyptian context, what we term magic and demon, 
						drawing on our own cultural heritage, are not seen as 
						negative aspects of cultural practice and 
						conceptualisation. Similarly, the Egyptian equivalents 
						do not carry the pejorative connotations borne by the 
						modern terms and their Greek antecedents; magic and 
						demons can be forces for good as well as evil. Indeed, 
						the practice of magic and the conceptualisation of 
						personified demonic agents are central to the Egyptian 
						understanding of the workings of the world from the very 
						continuation of the cosmos itself down to the 
						vicissitudes of existence faced by individuals. In 
						particular, the broader practice of magic and 
						articulation of the involvement of demonic agency form 
						one of the crucial links in Ancient Egypt between 
						individual existence on the human level and the level of 
						nature or the cosmos, the realm of the gods. Unlike, 
						though, the explicit recognition of the term demon in 
						the ancient Greek language and religion, as the 
						intermediary between god and mortals, the majority of 
						the demonic names in the Egyptian literature do not 
						possess an apparent ontological essence, or a clearly 
						defined denotation. Their characteristics and role 
						depended momentously on the verbal and performative 
						ritual environment they were part of. The relation 
						between the name of a demon and its cosmic-natural 
						personification is not contradictory as it may seem, but 
						it is closely interwoven in a well established ritual 
						framework of words and actions. This multi-authored 
						volume of 10 essays comprises an up-to-date 
						authorization account of many aspects of ancient 
						Egyptian demonology, including the multiple persona of 
						the demonic or name vs. identity in the Egyptian 
						formation of the demonic, nightmares and underworld 
						demons, dream rituals and magic, categories of demonic 
						entities and the vague distinction between the divine 
						and the demonic in Egyptian cosmology and ritual, the 
						theological and demonic aspects of Egyptian magic, 
						demons as reflections of human society. Contributors 
						include Paul John Frandsen, Hedvig Gyory, Joachim 
						Friedrich Quack, Yvan Koenig, Panagiotis Kousoulis, Alan 
						Lloyd, Robert Ritner, Alessandro Roccati, Kasia 
						Szpakowska and Penelope Wilson.

          Living Consciousness: The Metaphysical Vision of Henri Bergson
         </a>
         by G. William Barnard (S U N Y Series in Transpersonal and 
			Humanistic Psychology: New York State University Press) examines the 
			brilliant, but now largely ignored, insights of French philosopher 
			Henri Bergson (1859-1941). Offering a detailed and accessible 
			analysis of Bergson's thought, G. William Barnard highlights how 
			Bergson's understanding of the nature of consciousness and, in 
			particular, its relationship to the physical world remain strikingly 
			relevant to numerous contemporary fields. These range from quantum 
			physics and process thought to philosophy of mind, depth psychology, 
			transpersonal theory, and religious studies. Bergson's notion of 
			consciousness as a ceaselessly dynamic, inherently temporal 
			substance of reality itself provides a vision that can function as a 
			persuasive alternative to mechanistic and reductionistic 
			understandings of consciousness and reality. Barnard closes the work 
			with several "ruminations" or neo-Bergsonian responses to a series 
			of vitally important questions such as: What does it mean to live 
			consciously, authentically, and attuned to our inner depths? Is 
			there a philosophically sophisticated way to claim that the survival 
			of consciousness after physical death is not only possible but 
			likely?

		4 volume set
         </a>
         by Paul Heelas (Critical Concepts in Religious Studies: 
		Routledge) It would not be an exaggeration to say that during the last 
		century, most especially during and since the 1960s, the language of 
		spirituality has become one of the most significant ways in which the 
		sacred has come to be understood and judged in the West, and, 
		increasingly, elsewhere. Whether it is true that ‘spirituality’ has 
		eclipsed ‘religion’ in Western settings remains debatable. What is 
		incontestable is that the language of spirituality, together with 
		practices (most noticeably spiritual, complementary, and alternative 
		medicine), has become a major feature of the sacred dimensions of 
		contemporary modernity. Equally incontestably, spirituality is a growing 
		force in all those developing countries where its presence is 
		increasingly felt among the cosmopolitan elite, and where spiritual 
		forms of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine are 
		thriving.

          The Story of Islamic Philosophy: Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Al-'Arabi, 
						and Others on the Limit Between Naturalism and 
						Traditionalism
         </a>
         <span>
          by Salman H. Bashier (SUNY: 
						State University of New York Press) In this innovative 
						work, Salman H. Bashier challenges traditional views of 
						Islamic philosophy. While Islamic thought from the 
						crucial medieval period is often depicted as a 
						rationalistic elaboration on Aristotelian philosophy and 
						an attempt to reconcile it with the Muslim religion, 
						Bashier puts equal emphasis on the influence of Plato's 
						philosophical mysticism. This shift encourages a new 
						reading of Islamic intellectual tradition, one in which 
						boundaries between philosophy, religion, mysticism, and 
						myth are relaxed. Bashier shows the manner in which 
						medieval Islamic philosophers reflected on the relation 
						between philosophy and religion as a problem that is 
						intrinsic to philosophy and shows how their 
						deliberations had the effect of redefining the very 
						limits of their philosophical thought. The problems of 
						the origin of human beings, human language, and the 
						world in Islamic philosophy are discussed. Bashier 
						highlights the importance of Ibn Tufayl's
          <i>
           Hayy Ibn 
						Yaqzan,
          </i>
          a landmark work often overlooked by 
						scholars, and the thought of the great Sufi mystic Ibn 
						al-Arabi to the mainstream of Islamic philosophy.

           Ibn al-'Arabi's Barzakh: The Concept of the Limit and the Relationship between 
God and the World
          </a>
          by Salman H. Bashier (SUNY: State University of New York 
Press) This book explores how Ibn al-'Arabi (1165-1240) used the concept 
			of barzakh (the Limit) to deal with the philosophical problem of the 
			relationship between God and the world, a major concept disputed in 
			ancient and medieval Islamic thought. The term "barzakh" indicates 
			the activity or actor that differentiates between things and that, 
			paradoxically, then provides the context of their unity. Author 
			Salman H. Bashier looks at early thinkers and shows how the 
			synthetic solutions they developed provided the groundwork for Ibn 
			al-'Arabi's unique concept of barzakh. Bashier discusses Ibn al-'Arabi's 
			development of the concept of barzakh ontologically through the 
			notion of the Third Thing and epistemologically through the notion 
			of the Perfect Man, and compares Ibn al-'Arabi's vision with 
			Plato's.
         </p>
         <p>
          "Salmon H. Bashier has rightly identified the importance of the 
			concept of the Limit (barzakh), a central theme in Ibn al-'Arabi's 
			thought, and situates the concept in two new contexts: earlier 
			Islamic thought as a whole, and the larger Western philosophic 
			tradition. It is a worthy ambition." —John Walbridge

         It is finally here. Wrapped in a stunning jacket design featuring 
			the author's own photographs and embossed gold and black titling, 
			the two massive volumes of Derek Parfit's On What Matters will be 
			the most beautiful philosophy books on any shelf they grace -- a 
			worthy start to living up to over a decade of being "the most 
			eagerly awaited book in philosophy", according to Oxford University 
			Press's promotion materials. Given the enormous stature of Parfit's 
			1984 Reasons and Persons (my colleague Jake Ross calls its part IV 
			'the Platonic Form of philosophy') and Parfit's selective 
			publication schedule, it should be no surprise that his second book 
			should be so anticipated. But with Brad Hooker's [2010] advance 
			notice that it is "probably . . . the most important publication in 
			moral philosophy since Henry Sidgwick's The Methods of Ethics in 
			1874" and Peter Singer's [2011] front-page Times Literary Supplement 
			gush that it is "the most significant work in ethics since 
			Sidgwick's masterpiece was published in 1873," On What Matters 
			certainly has a lot to live up to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lofty expectations aside, there is no doubt that On What Matters 
			is an epochal work. Philosophers my age and younger have never 
			experienced a philosophical world in which there were not 
			conferences and symposia being organized for Parfit to present 
			drafts of the material collected in this work and critics to 
			evaluate it before it was even finished. It is at the same time one 
			of the most collaborative philosophical works ever created (Parfit 
			thanks hundreds for their input) and one of the most intensely 
			personal. And the book is indeed a remarkable achievement, giving us 
			a truly comprehensive picture of the moral outlook -- both normative 
			and metaethical -- of one of the greatest moral thinkers of our 
			time. Whether or not its many specific arguments are widely 
			accepted, the comprehensive picture of the normative terrain it 
			outlines is one with which future work will need to grapple.

        <p>
         Working with incredible energy and productivity, Beckmann

         Max Beckmann is one of the titans of modern art, although he 
			considered himself the last of the Old Masters. This publication 
			examines the artist's landscape paintings, which are not 
			characterized by layers of allegorical meaning, as are his works in 
			other genres, and their splendid painterly qualities are instantly 
			perceptible. One of the foundations for these landscapes is the 
			potent experience of nature. Personal objects belonging to Beckmann 
			frequently appear in the foreground, like remnants of still lifes, 
			making the viewer aware of the artist's presence. On the other hand, 
			the paintings are realistic reproductions of places he visited, for 
			which Beckmann also made reference to photographs or postcards. A 
			third artistic idea came from art itself: flashes of Beckmann's 
			immense knowledge of art history can be seen in his citations of 
			other works. Thus, his landscapes can be regarded as a kind of 
			summation of his understanding of the world.

         </a>
         by John Edward Fletcher and Elizabeth Fletcher 
			(Aries Book: Brill Academic) 
			Athanasius Kircher, a German Jesuit in 17th-century Rome, was an enigma. 
			Intensely pious and a prolific author, he was also a polymath fascinated with everything from 
			Egyptian hieroglyphs to the tiny creatures in his microscope. 
His correspondence with popes, princes and priests was a window into the restless energy of the period. 
It showed first-hand the seventeenth-century’s struggle for knowledge in astronomy, microscopy, geology, 
chemistry, musicology, Egyptology, horology… The list goes on. 

Kircher’s books reflect the mind-set of 17th-century scholars - endless curiosity and a … read more substantial larding of naiveté: 
Kircher scorned alchemy as the wishful thinking of charlatans, yet believed in dragons.


His life and correspondence provide a key to the transition from the Middle Ages to a new scientific age. This book, though unpublished, has been long quoted and referred to. 
Awaited by scholars and specialists of Kircher, it is finally available with this edition.

         [Hardcover] by Jonathan I. Israel (Oxford 
			University Press) That the Enlightenment shaped modernity is

			This is precisely what Jonathan Israel now does.

         In
         <em>
          Democratic Enlightenment
         </em>
         , Israel demonstrates that the 
			Enlightenment was an essentially revolutionary process, driven by 
			philosophical debate. The American Revolution and its concerns 
			certainly acted as a major factor in the intellectual ferment that 
			shaped the wider upheaval that followed, but the radical
         <em>
          philosophes
         </em>
         were no less critical than enthusiastic about the 
			American model. From 1789, the General Revolution's impetus came 
			from a small group of
         <em>
          philosophe-revolutionnaires
         </em>
         , men such 
			as Mirabeau, Sieyes, Condorcet, Volney, Roederer, and Brissot. Not 
			aligned to any of the social groups represented in the French 
			National assembly, they nonetheless forged "
         <em>
          la philosophie 
			moderne
         </em>
         "--in effect Radical Enlightenment ideas--into a 
			world-transforming ideology that had a lasting impact in Latin 
			America, Canada and eastern Europe as well as France, Italy, 
			Germany, and the Low Countries. In addition, Israel argues that 
			while all French revolutionary journals powerfully affirmed that
         <em>
          la philosophie moderne
         </em>
         was the main cause of the French 
			Revolution, the main stream of historical thought has failed to 
			grasp what this implies. Israel sets the record straight, 
			demonstrating the true nature of the engine that drove the 
			Revolution, and the intimate links between the radical wing of the 
			Enlightenment and the anti-Robespierriste "Revolution of reason."

          The Existence of God: An Exposition and Application of 
					Fregean Meta-Ontology
         </a>
         by Stig Børsen Hansen 
					(Quellen Und Studien Zur Philosophie: De Gruyter) This study 
					breaks new ground on the question of the existence of God. 
					It innovatively combines biblical scholarship with an 
					analysis of existence drawn from the writings of the 
					philosopher Gottlob Frege. It shows that the strength of 
					Frege's approach is its emphasis on the notions of proper 
					name and predicate; this in turn sheds new light on 
					important elements of theological language. Finally, the 
					Fregean approach in this book is defended against objections 
					drawn from readings of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus 
					Logico-Philosophicus.

          Plants As Persons: A Philosophical Botany
         </a>
         by Matthew Hall 
			and Harold Coward (SUNY Series on Religion and the 
			Environment: State University of New York, SUNY) Plants are people 
			too? Not exactly, but in this work of philosophical botany Matthew 
			Hall challenges readers to reconsider the moral standing of plants, 
			arguing that they are other-than-human persons. Plants constitute 
			the bulk of our visible biomass, underpin all natural ecosystems, 
			and make life on Earth possible. Yet plants are considered passive 
			and insensitive beings rightly placed outside moral consideration. 
			As the human assault on nature continues, more ethical behavior 
			toward plants is needed. Hall surveys Western, Eastern, Pagan, and 
			Indigenous thought, as well as modern science and botanical history, 
			for attitudes toward plants, noting the particular resources for 
			plant personhood and those modes of thought which most exclude 
			plants. The most hierarchical systems typically put plants at the 
			bottom, but Hall finds much to support a more positive view of 
			plants. Indeed, some Indigenous animisms actually recognize plants 
			as relational, intelligent beings who are the appropriate recipients 
			of care and respect. New scientific findings encourage this 
			perspective, revealing that plants possess many of the capacities of 
			sentience and mentality traditionally denied them.

			from the spiritual to the corporate. The contributors present 
			research on essential questions about the existence and prevalence 
			of high levels of personal growth, whether such achievement is

			levels of growth actually indicate happiness, what kinds of people 
			exhibit these higher levels of development, how they may have

          Socrates and Philosophy in the Dialogues of Plato
         </a>
         by
			Sandra Peterson (Cambridge University Press) 		In Plato's Apology, Socrates says he spent his life examining and questioning people on how best to live, while avowing that he himself knows nothing important. Elsewhere, however, for example in Plato's Republic, Plato's Socrates 
			presents radical and grandiose theses.
         <br/>
         In this book Sandra Peterson 
			offers a new hypothesis which explains the puzzle of Socrates' two 
			contrasting manners. She argues that the apparently confident 
			doctrinal Socrates is in fact conducting the first step of an 
			examination: by eliciting his interlocutors' reactions, his 
			apparently doctrinal lectures reveal what his interlocutors believe 
			is the best way to live. She tests her hypothesis by close reading 
			of passages in the Theaetetus, Republic, and Phaedo. Her provocative 
			conclusion, that there is a single Socrates whose conception and 
			practice of philosophy remain the same throughout the dialogues, will be of 
			interest to a wide range of readers in ancient philosophy and 
			classics.

         by Brian 
			Lightbody(American University Studies Series V: v 209, Philosophy: Peter 
			Lang) Philosophical Genealogy Volume I: An Epistemological 
			Reconstruction of Nietzsche and Foucault's Genealogical Method is a 
			rigorous examination of the philosophical investigatory practice 
			known as "genealogy." This critique of the philosophical tradition 
			leads to the creation of new values. Both Nietzsche and Foucault 
			extolled these critical and emancipatory virtues of genealogy.
         <br/>
         Volume I examines the principal ontological and epistemological 
			problems with Nietzsche and Foucault's respective uses of the 
			genealogical method. It elucidates the differences between genealogy 
			and other forms of historical inquiry before turning to explicate, 
			in great detail, the three axes of genealogical inquiry: the power 
			axis, the truth axis and the ethical axis. Volume I explains the 
			very important role the body plays in a genealogical investigation 
			before examining several of the problems with the doctrine of perspectivism—a central component to a genealogical inquiry.
         <br/>
         Volume II: An Epistemological Reconstruction of the Genealogical 
			Method, these problems are now resolved. Volume II establishes what 
			requisite ontological underpinnings are required in order to provide 
			a successful, epistemic reconstruction of the genealogical method. 
			Problems regarding the nature of the body, the relation between 
			power and resistance as well as the justification of Nietzschean 
			perspectivism, are now all clearly answered. It is shown that 
			genealogy is a profound, fecund and, most importantly, coherent 
			method of philosophical and historical investigation which may 
			produce many new discoveries in the fields of ethics and moral 
			inquiry provided it is correctly employed.

          Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla's Hermeneutics
         </a>
         by Elke Morlok (Mohr 
			Siebeck) Elke Morlok deals with the hermeneutics of R. Joseph 
			Gikatilla, one of the most outstanding and influential kabbalists of 
			medieval Jewish mysticism. His literary creativity falls onto the 
			last decades of the 13th century, when very innovative ideas on 
			kabbalah and its hermeneutics were developed and formulated for the 
			first time. The author analyzes several key concepts throughout his 
			writings such as his ideas on letter combination, symbol, memory, 
			imagination and ritual and their varying functions within the 
			hermeneutical and theosophic structures that underlie Gikatilla's 
			approach. With the application of methods derived from modern 
			theories on language and literature, she tries to create the basis 
			for a fruitful encounter between medieval mystical hermeneutics and 
			postmodern hermeneutical approaches. As Gikatilla incorporates two 
			main trends of kabbalistic thinking during the medieval period, he 
			was one of the most valuable sources for Christian thinkers 
			interested in medieval kabbalistic thought.

			Publishing) 
				Despite Parmenides' tremendous importance during his own 
				lifetime and his perennial influence on philosophical thought 
				ever since, the great Eleatic - born circa 515 BCE and described 
				by Plato as "Venerable and Awesome" (Theaetetus, 183e) - had 
				never been the subject of an international conference until 
				2007, when some of the world's most eminent specialists on 
				Parmenides' philosophy convened for a multinational and 
				multilingual Symposium in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This present 
				volume offers a collection of the papers (translated, where 
				applicable) presented at the conference, each advancing the 
				respective scholar's current state of research on Parmenides and 
				his Poem, "On Nature", often with far-reaching and sometimes 
				controversial results. The topics discussed include the 
				challenge of translation, the Poem's poetic form, its logical 
				structure, the sequence of the fragments, the interpretation of 
				"Aletheia" and "Doxa", what Parmenides meant by "mortals" the 
				Poem's "physics" (especially Parmenidean astronomy), the various 
				senses of Being and the role of thought, as well as Plato's 
				relationship to Parmenides. In their different ways each 
				contribution conveys a deep appreciation for the revolutionary 
				nature of Parmenides' philosophy, and the collection as a whole 
				bears witness to the fact that the study of Parmenides continues 
				to yield rich and prolific scholarship - perhaps today more so 
				than ever. This book is intended for scholars and 
				non-specialists alike, and will be of particular relevance to 
				students of Ancient Greek Philosophy, Classical Studies, as well 
				as philosophy and literature more generally. It includes 
				contributors such as: Scott Austin; Jean Bollack; Giovanni 
				Casertano; Barbara Cassin; Giovanni Cerri; Nestor-Luis Cordero; 
				Lambros Couloubaritsis; Patricia Curd; Jean Frere; Arnold

         <br/>
         'Plato’s Parmenides and 
			Its Heritage' presents in two volumes ground-breaking results in the 
			history of interpretation of Plato’s Parmenides, the culmination of 
			six years of international collaboration by the SBL Annual Meeting 
			seminar, “Rethinking Plato’s Parmenides and Its Platonic, Gnostic 
			and Patristic Reception” (2001–2007).
         <br/>
         The theme of Volume 1 is the dissolution of firm boundaries 
			for thinking about the tradition of Parmenides interpretation from 
			the Old Academy through Middle Platonism and Gnosticism. The volume 
			suggests a radically different interpretation of the history of 
			thought from Plato to Proclus than is customary by arguing against 
			Proclus’s generally accepted view that there was no metaphysical 
			interpretation of the Parmenides before Plotinus in the third 
			century C.E. Instead, this volume traces such metaphysical 
			interpretations, first, to Speusippus and the early Platonic 
			Academy; second, to the Platonism of the first and second centuries 
			C.E. in figures like Moderatus and Numenius; third, to the emergence 
			of an exegetical tradition that read Aristotle’s categories in 
			relation to the Parmenides; and, fourth, to important Middle 
			Platonic figures and texts. The contributors to Volume 1 are Kevin 
			Corrigan, Gerald Bechtle, Luc Brisson, John Dillon, Thomas Szlezák, 
			Zlatko Pleše, Noel Hubler, John D. Turner, Johanna Brankaer, Volker 
			Henning Drecoll, and Alain Lernould.
         <br/>
         Volume 2 examines and establishes for the first time evidence for a 
			significant knowledge of the Parmenides in Philo, Clement, and 
			patristic sources. It offers an extensive and balanced analysis of 
			the case for and against the various possible attributions of date 
			and authorship of the Anonymous Commentary in relation to 
			Gnosticism, Middle Platonism, and Neoplatonism and argues that on

          Popular Religion and Shamanism
         </a>
         by 
									Edited by Ma Xisha and Meng Huiying 
									(Religious Studies in Contemporary China 
									Collection: Brill Academic) addresses 
									two areas of religion within Chinese 
									society; the lay teachings that Chinese 
									scholars term folk or `popular' religion, 
									and shamanism. Each area represents a 
									distinct tradition of scholarship, and the 
									book is therefore split into two parts.
         <br/>
         PART I: Popular Religion discusses the evolution 
									of organized lay movements over an arc often 
									centuries. Its eight chapters focus on three 
									key points: the arrival and integration of 
									new ideas before the Song dynasty, the 
									coalescence of an intellectual and 
									scriptural tradition during the Ming, and 
									the efflorescence of new organizations 
									during the late Qing.
         <br/>
         PART II: Shamanism reflects the revived interest 
									of scholars in traditional beliefs and 
									culture that reemerged with the 'open' 
									policy in China that occurred in the 197os. 
									Two of the essays included in this section 
									address shamanism in northeast China where 
									the traditions played an important role in 
									the cultures of the Manchu, Mongol, Sibe, 
									Daur, Oroqen, Evenki, and Hezhen. The other 
									essay discusses divination rites in a local 
									culture of southwest China.
         <br/>
         Both sections of Popular Religion and 
									Shamanism will introduce Western readers to 
									the ideas of Chinese scholars, not just 
									their data.

          Re-Symbolization of the Self: Human Development and Tarot 
			Hermeneutic
         </a>
         by Inna Semetsky (Sense Publishers) This 
			groundbreaking book brings depth of meaning and intellectual 
			scholarship to the field of human development while also lifting the 
			human spirit by offering new dimensions of self-formation through 
			the ancient medium of Tarot. It should be of great interest to 
			health and human service professionals. --JEAN WATSON, Distinguished 
			Professor, University of Colorado Denver College of Nursing; author 
			of Nursing: The Philosophy and Science of Caring and Caring Science 
			as Sacred Science.
        </p>
        <p>
         Semetsky's book is a timely antidote for our current crises 
			in education. Drawing on her empirical research with Tarot and her 
			deep knowledge of Jungian psychology, she offers an approach to 
			education that stirs the depths of the Self as it deepens mind into 
			soul. Her Tarot hermeneutic opens a path toward a revolutionary 
			pedagogy that, in its commitment to the complexity, fullness and 
			fluidity of human subjectivity, recovers the ethical and therapeutic 
			dimensions of education. A bold book, a daring achievement, a spark 
			of illumination! --ROBERT D. ROMANYSHYN, Senior Core Faculty, 
			Pacifica Graduate Institute; Affiliate Member of the Inter-Regional 
			Society of Jungian Analysts; author of The Wounded Researcher: 
			Research with Soul in Mind and Ways of the Heart: Essays toward an 
			Imaginal Psychology.
         <br/>
         This text elucidates the potential of Tarot well beyond its 
			popular usage. It demonstrates how Tarot can become a pedagogical 
			and counseling tool for enriching human experiences and the whole of 
			culture with wisdom, integrity, meaning, and spirituality. A must to 
			read! ---MARY K. GREER, author of Tarot for Your Self: A Workbook 
			for Personal Transformation.
         <br/>
         Bringing together popular and academic cultures, Inna 
			Semetsky presents Tarot as a system of transformative hermeneutics 
			for adult self-education and cultural pedagogy. Her research is a 
			decisive and intelligent step ahead from the reductive stereotype of 
			Tarot as fortune-telling. The fifteen life stories at the heart of 
			the book exemplify the author's commitment to alternative modes of 
			education and counseling that transcend individual, cultural or 
			language barriers. Assembling a rich array of sources, from 
			Hermeticism to Jungian depth psychology, the philosophies of 
			Noddings, Buber, and Deleuze, and the science of self-organization, 
			this book opens a new path to personal and social revitalization. It 
			should be widely read across disciplinary divides by scholars, 
			students, and professionals alike. --PHILIP WEXLER, Professor, 
			Hebrew University of Jerusalem; author of Symbolic Movement: 
			Critique and Spirituality in Sociology of Education and Holy Sparks: 
			Social Theory, Education and Religion.

          Archetypal Cosmos: Rediscovering the Gods in Myth, Science, and 
			Astrology
         </a>
         by Keiron Le Grice (Floris Books) The modern world is passing through a period of critical change 
			on many levels: cultural, political, ecological and spiritual. We 
			are witnessing the decline and dissolution of the old order, the 
			tumult and uncertainty of a new birth. Against this background, 
			Keiron Le Grice argues that the developing insights of a new 
			cosmology could provide a coherent framework of meaning to lead us 
			beyond the growing fragmentation of culture, belief and personal 
			identity.
         <br/>
         In a compelling synthesis of the ideas of seminal thinkers from 
			depth psychology and new paradigm science, Le Grice positions the 
			new discipline of archetypal astrology at the centre of an emerging 
			world view that reunifies psyche and cosmos, spirituality and 
			science, mythology and metaphysics, enabling us to see mythic gods, 
			heroes and themes in a fresh light.
         <br/>
         Heralding a 'rediscovery of the gods' and the passage into a new 
			spiritual era, The Archetypal Cosmos presents a new understanding of 
			the role of myth and archetypal principles in our lives, one that 
			could give a cosmic perspective and deeper meaning to our personal 
			experience.

			summer of 1947. He would spend the last three years of his life far 
			away from Europe, years that signified a liberating, intense new 
			start for him. The vastness of the foreign continent, its coasts, 
			the atmosphere of its "wild" landscapes, and its big cities all 
			formed a palpable source of inspiration for Beckmann, who had never 
			before had this type of physical experience of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Working with incredible energy and productivity, Beckmann 
			produced numerous major works in these few short years. From today's 
			perspective, Beckmann's independence is all the more impressive when 
			seen in relation to the development of abstract art that was taking 
			place in America at the same time. Beckmann retained his link to 
			representationalism and its metaphorical themes, yet still managed 
			to assert himself as a European painter of international status.

       Max Beckmann is one of the titans of modern art, although he 
			considered himself the last of the Old Masters. This publication 
			examines the artist's landscape paintings, which are not 
			characterized by layers of allegorical meaning, as are his works in 
			other genres, and their splendid painterly qualities are instantly 
			perceptible. One of the foundations for these landscapes is the 
			potent experience of nature. Personal objects belonging to Beckmann 
			frequently appear in the foreground, like remnants of still lifes, 
			making the viewer aware of the artist's presence. On the other hand, 
			the paintings are realistic reproductions of places he visited, for 
			which Beckmann also made reference to photographs or postcards. A 
			third artistic idea came from art itself: flashes of Beckmann's 
			immense knowledge of art history can be seen in his citations of 
			other works. Thus, his landscapes can be regarded as a kind of 
			summation of his understanding of the world.

			(Edwin Mellen Press) Professor Ligo s defense and illustration of 
			his claim that Manet s work represents an intelligent and active 
			attempt to embody the modernist aesthetic of his friend, the poet 
			and art critic Charles Baudelaire, makes for absorbing reading. Well 
			aware of the many reasons why Baudelaire may not have been either 
			willing or able to write a full-length essay on Manet in the years 
			1863-1866 when he knew him best (hard years for Baudelaire, who 
			would die in 1867 and who had lived in Brussels since 1864, in a 
			desperate search for funds and publishers), Professor Ligo fills in 
			the background details both on the friendship between the two men 
			and the artistic life of the times. There are fascinating parallels 
			between specific works by the two artists (

       for instance, seen in tandem 
			with Manet s "D’jeuner sur l herbe" and particularly interesting 
			arguments about photography and the place of the crowd for both 
			Baudelaire and Manet. Dr. Ligo makes a strong and well-documented 
			case for his conviction that Manet consciously decided to take up 
			the challenge to contemporary painters that Baudelaire sets down in 
			his famous and influential essay, “
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Painters-Modern-Life-Arts-Letters/dp/0714833657/wordtrade-20">
        The 
			Painter of Modern Life

       ”. There is much here for scholars of both 
			Baudelaire and Manet (the parallels enable us to see each in a 
			different light) and for the general reader interested in 
			impressionism, the influence of photography and/or aesthetics more 
			broadly.

        Cézanne in Provence
       </a>
       edited by Philip Conisbee and Denis Coutagne 
			(Yale University Press) It was in Paris, not Provence, that 
			Cézanne's art history was made. The centre of the artworld has since 
			been shifted from Paris by the rise of America, but power relations 
			between periphery and centre prevail. The major exhibition that gave 
			rise to this catalogue (available in English and French) would not 
			have been possible without the power of the centre, Washington's 
			National Gallery of Art. The Musée Granet in Aix was thereby able to 
			offer a blockbuster show as a major tourist magnet for the Midi 
			during summer 2006, when the Jas de Bouffan opened to the public. 
			All this is part of a project, 'Cézanne 2006', backed by various 
			development agencies. What is represented for cultural tourism is 
			'Cézanne's Provence', a short-circuit of nature and painter in which 
			the genius loci of the Aixois landscape supposedly formed Cézanne's 
			approach and the art then forged how we came to see this terrain.

        Plato on Music, Soul and Body
       </a>
       by Francesco Pelosi 
			(Cambridge University Press) Plato's reflection on the relationship between soul and body has 
			attracted scholars' attention since antiquity. Less noted, but 
			worthy of consideration, is Plato's thought on music and its effects 
			on human beings. This book adopts an innovative approach towards 
			analysing the soul—body problem by uncovering and emphasising the 
			philosophical value of Plato's treatment of the phenomenon of music. 
			By investigating in detail how Plato conceives of the musical 
			experience and its influence on intelligence, passions and 
			perceptions, it illuminates the intersection of cognitive and 
			emotional functions in Plato's philosophy of mind.
       <br/>
       FRANCESCO PELOSI obtained a Ph.D. in philosophy at the Scuola 
			Normale Superiore in Pisa. His main field of research is the 
			relation between music and philosophy in ancient Greece.

         The Unity of Linguistic Meaning
        </a>
        by John Collins 
			(University of Oxford Press) The problem of the unity of the proposition is almost as old as 
				philosophy itself, and was one of the central themes of early 
				analytical philosophy, greatly exercising the minds of Frege, 
				Russell, Wittgenstein, and Ramsey. The problem is how 
				propositions or meanings can be simultaneously unities (single 
				things) and complexes, made up of parts that are autonomous of 
				the positions they happen to fill in any given proposition. The 
				problem has been associated with numerous paradoxes and has 
				motivated general theories of thought and meaning, but has 
				eluded any consensual resolution; indeed, the problem is 
				sometimes thought to be wholly erroneous, a result of atomistic 
				assumptions we should reject. In short, the problem has been 
				thought to be of merely historical interest. Collins argues that 
				the problem is very real and poses a challenge to any theory of 
				linguistic meaning. He seeks to resolve the problem by laying 
				down some minimal desiderata on a solution and presenting a 
				uniquely satisfying account. The first part of the book surveys 
				and rejects extant 'solutions' and dismissals of the problem 
				from (especially) Frege and Russell, and a host of more 
				contemporary thinkers, including Davidson and Dummett. The 
				book's second part offers a novel solution based upon the 
				properties of a basic syntactic principle called 'Merge', which 
				may be said to create objects inside objects, thus showing how 
				unities can be both single things but also made up of proper 
				parts. The solution is defended from both philosophical and 
				linguistic perspectives. The overarching ambition of the book, 
				therefore, is to strengthen the ties between current linguistics 
				and contemporary philosophy of language in a way that is 
				genuinely sensitive to the history of both fields.

        Parmenides, Venerable and Awesome: Proceedings of the International 
			Symposium
       </a>
       by Nestor-Luis Cordero (Parmenides 
			Publishing) 
				Despite Parmenides' tremendous importance during his own 
				lifetime and his perennial influence on philosophical thought 
				ever since, the great Eleatic - born circa 515 BCE and described 
				by Plato as "Venerable and Awesome" (Theaetetus, 183e) - had 
				never been the subject of an international conference until 
				2007, when some of the world's most eminent specialists on 
				Parmenides' philosophy convened for a multinational and 
				multilingual Symposium in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This present 
				volume offers a collection of the papers (translated, where 
				applicable) presented at the conference, each advancing the 
				respective scholar's current state of research on Parmenides and 
				his Poem, "On Nature", often with far-reaching and sometimes 
				controversial results. The topics discussed include the 
				challenge of translation, the Poem's poetic form, its logical 
				structure, the sequence of the fragments, the interpretation of 
				"Aletheia" and "Doxa", what Parmenides meant by "mortals" the 
				Poem's "physics" (especially Parmenidean astronomy), the various 
				senses of Being and the role of thought, as well as Plato's 
				relationship to Parmenides. In their different ways each 
				contribution conveys a deep appreciation for the revolutionary 
				nature of Parmenides' philosophy, and the collection as a whole 
				bears witness to the fact that the study of Parmenides continues 
				to yield rich and prolific scholarship - perhaps today more so 
				than ever. This book is intended for scholars and 
				non-specialists alike, and will be of particular relevance to 
				students of Ancient Greek Philosophy, Classical Studies, as well 
				as philosophy and literature more generally. It includes 
				contributors such as: Scott Austin; Jean Bollack; Giovanni 
				Casertano; Barbara Cassin; Giovanni Cerri; Nestor-Luis Cordero; 
				Lambros Couloubaritsis; Patricia Curd; Jean Frere; Arnold 
				Hermann; Charles H Kahn; Alexander P D Mourelatos; Massimo

       ), and the apparent simplicity of its central 
				thought -- "being is" -- Parmenides continues to nourish 
				speculation, historical research, and philological debate. We 
				now even have Parmenides Publishing, which has printed or 
				reprinted over half a dozen studies of the pre-Socratic to date. 
				The series Continuum Studies in Ancient Philosophy currently 
				includes no fewer than three books on the topic: Raymond Tallis'

       <em class="style1" style="outline: 0;">

       </em>
       . Adluri's work 
				stands out for the radicality of its argument, the subtlety of 
				its interdisciplinary interpretations, and the forthright 
				passion that motivates it.
       <br/>
       Adluri's radical reading denies that Parmenides is the enemy 
				of plurality and becoming. How can this be, if the poem bluntly 
				argues that, since "being is," becoming is unthinkable and being 
				is eternally one -- pastless, futureless, and featureless? The 
				answer begins in plain sight, on the surface of the poem, but 
				this surface has been ignored all too often by readers who 
				assume they already know what Parmenides stands for.  
				Parmenides does not in fact say "being is." The phrase (with its 
				sundry tortured variations) is uttered by an unnamed goddess who 
				addresses the poem's narrator. The poem begins in the first 
				person, describing the narrator's (Parmenides'?) passionate 
				journey ("as far as
       <em class="style1" style="outline: 0;">
        thumos
       </em>
       might reach," fragment 1, line 1) to the gates of 
				the divine domain. The goddess then welcomes the voyager and 
				presents two accounts: an account of the "truth" (monistic 
				being) and an account of mortal opinions about the mutable 
				cosmos. The usual assumption is that the first-person proem is 
				window dressing: like the dactylic hexameter, it is a remnant of 
				or concession to the prephilosophical, mythmaking culture from 
				which Parmenides is emerging. The goddess' first account is 
				assumed to be Parmenides' own theory. Her second account is then 
				problematic: if there
       <em class="style1" style="outline: 0;">
        is
       </em>
       nothing but being, how can there "be" a plurality of phenomena, 
				opinions (whether true or untrue), and opiners? Parmenides the 
				monist turns out to be an extreme dualist, due to his 
				uncompromising split between reality and appearance. Our task is 
				then to construct a logical solution to this split -- if not 
				within Parmenides' theory itself, then in our own physical or 
				metaphysical theories.

       </a>
       by F. C. S. Schiller and H. P. McDonald (Contemporary Studies in 
			Philosophy and the Human Sciences: Humanity Books) In his prolific seventy-three-year lifetime, F. C. S. Schiller 
			was a well-known philosopher of the highest repute, considered 
			synonymous with humanist philosophy. Up until his death in 1937, he 
			carried the torch of pragmatism and self-titled humanism into the 
			twentieth century, nearly single-handedly energizing European 
			debates over pragmatic approaches to logic, science, truth, and 
			reality. He retained humanism as the foundation for his entire 
			philosophy, stressing that the environment, knowledge, and values 
			must always be the creation of human choices and activities.
       <br/>
       The study of Schiller's most important contributions to the 
			philosophical traditions of humanism and pragmatism continues to be 
			of great significance for contemporary scholars. The forty-two 
			pieces that appear in this volume, carefully selected from his 
			.books, journal articles, and essay contributions published between 
			1891 and 1939, represent Schiller's finest writings. They range 
			across a broad spectrum of specific topics: logic and scientific 
			method, meaning and truth, pluralism and monism, personalism and 
			idealism, metaphysics and values, evolution and religion, and ethics 
			and politics. The collection also includes an introduction to 
			Schiller's life and career, introductory essays, and a bibliography 
			of his momentous work, With reverential enthusiasm, Shook and 
			McDonald have here awakened the intelligent and passionate voice of 
			humanism's all-too-neglected driving force.

       by Lee Braver 
			(Cambridge University Press) This volume of essays by

			Heidegger's thought and major critical interpretations of it. It 
			explores such central themes as hermeneutics, facticity and Ereignis, 
			conscience in Being and Time, freedom in the writings of his period 
			of transition from fundamental ontology, and his mature criticisms 
			of metaphysics and ontotheology. The volume also examines 
			Heidegger's interpretations of other authors, the philosophers 
			Aristotle, Kant and Nietzsche and the poets Rilke, Trakl and George. 
			A final group of essays interprets the critical reception of 
			Heidegger's thought, both in the analytic tradition (Ryle, Carnap, 
			Rorty and Dreyfus) and in France (Derrida and Lévinas). This rich 
			and wide-ranging collection will appeal to all who are interested in 
			the themes, the development and the context of Heidegger's

        From 
			Inquiry to Demonstrative Knowledge: New Essays on Aristotle's 
			Posterior Analytics
       </a>
       edited by J. H. Lesher (Academic Printing 
			and Publishing)  ISBN 9781926598017. Aristotle's Posterior Analytics is regarded as an original work 
			that determined the course of philosophy of science — and to some 
			extent of science itself — for two millennia. Nevertheless the work 
			poses many challenges to the scholar. How does the demonstrative 
			syllogism that is the focus of Aristotle's interest in the APo 
			relate to the non-syllogistic accounts of phenomena that we find in 
			his scientific treatises? How do the accounts of knowledge, 
			definition, and explanation put forward in the APo stand in relation 
			to other elements in Aristotle's philosophy — his accounts of 
			substance, the four causes, the distinctions between actuality and 
			potentiality, form and matter, processes and activities, etc? How 
			exactly do we know the first principles of scientific inquiry: why 
			should we suppose that we have access to some non-demonstrative way 
			of knowing, why in explaining how we can know first principles does 
			Aristotle focus instead on how we form concepts, and what could it 
			possibly mean to say that 'while we perceive the particular, 
			perception is of the universal'? The distinguished contributors to 
			this volume address all of these questions and more. The volume sets 
			a new standard for the interpretation and assessment of one of 
			Aristotle's most important philosophical works.

       by Averroës and 
			edited translated by Rudiger 
			Arnzen (Scientia Graeco-Arabica: De Gruyter) The Arab philosopher Abu L-Walid Muhammad Ibn Rushd (1126-98), 
			among western historians of philosophy better known by his Latinized 
			name Averroës, composed more than thirty commentaries and studies on 
			the works of Aristotle. Although these commentaries had an enormous 
			influence on medieval Latin and Hebrew philosophy in general as well 
			as on the reception and transformation of Aristotelian doctrines in 
			particular, a lot of them are still in need of reliable critical 
			editions, and an even greater number still await complete modern 
			translations in order to be readily accessible to students and 
			scholars of medieval philosophy unable to read the original Arabic 
			texts.
       <br/>
       This applies also to the work presented here for the first time 
			in a complete English translation for which there is no definitive 
			critical edition of the Arabic text available. As a matter of fact, 
			the translation was originally supposed to be accompanied by a 
			critical edition of the Arabic text itself—a plan that had to be 
			postponed for the time being because it was impossible to obtain 
			copies of all extant medieval and early modern manuscripts of the 
			work. However, the translation is based not only on the previous 
			editions of the text, but also on a number of thoroughly collated 
			Arabic manuscripts not taken into consideration in these editions. 
			Thus, the present translation is not only of interest to those 
			engaged in medieval philosophy yet unable to examine the Arabic 
			documents, but it might also be helpful for exploring the Arabic 
			manuscripts and assaying Averroes' intentions more comprehensively 
			and accurately than this has been possible on the basis of the 
			previous Arabic editions.

        Petrarch's Humanism and the Care of the Self
       </a>
       by Gur Zak (Cambridge 
University Press) Petrarch was one of the founding fathers of Renaissance 
humanism, yet the nature and significance of his ideas are still widely debated. 
In this book, Gur Zak examines two central issues in Petrarch's works - his 
humanist philosophy and his concept of the self. Zak argues that both are 
defined by Petrarch's idea of care for the self. Overcome by a strong sense of 
fragmentation, Petrarch turned to the ancient idea that philosophy can bring 
harmony and wholeness to the soul through the use of spiritual exercises in the 
form of writing. Examining his vernacular poetry and his Latin works from both 
literary and historical perspectives, Zak explores Petrarch's attempts to use 
writing as a spiritual exercise, how his spiritual techniques absorbed and 
transformed ancient and medieval traditions of writing, and the tensions that 
arose from his efforts to care for the self through writing.

        When Philosophers Rule: Ficino on Plato's Republic, Laws &amp; Epinomis 
			(Commentaries by Ficino on Plato's Writing)
       </a>
       Translation by 
			Arthur Farndell (Shepheard-Walwyn) Marsillio Ficino of 
			Florence (1433-99) was one of the most influential thinkers of the 
			Renaissance. He put before society a new ideal of human nature, 
			emphasising its divine potential. As teacher and guide to a 
			remarkable circle of men, he made a vital contribution to changes 
			that were taking place in European thought. For Ficino, the writings 
			of Plato provided the key to the most important knowledge for 
			mankind, knowledge of God and the soul. It was the absorption of 
			this knowledge that proved so important to Ficino, to his circle, 
			and to later writers and artists. As a young man, Ficino had been 
			directed by Cosimo de’ Medici towards the study of Plato in the 
			original Greek. Later he formed a close connection with Cosimo’s 
			grandson, Lorenzo de’ Medici, under whom Florence achieved its age 
			of brilliance. Gathered round Ficino and Lorenzo were such men as 
			Landino, Bembo, Poliziano and Pico della Mirandola. The ideas they 
			discussed became central to the work of Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, 
			Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Dürer, and many other writers and 
			artists. Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of 
			this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political 
			greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who 
			pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand 
			aside, cities will never have rest from their evils, - no, nor the 
			human race, as I believe, - and then only will this our State have a 
			possibility of life and behold the light of day.' Republic, Book V, 
			473D With these words Plato expressed his ideal form of government. 
			Often dismissed as unrealisable, they have appealed down the ages to 
			men of goodwill. Having translated all of the Dialogues from Greek 
			into Latin, at the request of his Medici patrons, Ficino was asked 
			to prepare summaries by Lorenzo de’ Medici, the de facto ruler of 
			the republic of Florence, who aspired to be the kind of enlightened 
			ruler Plato described.

        Uranium Wars: The Scientific Rivalry that Created the Nuclear Age
       </a>
       by Amir D. Aczel (Macmillian) Set against the darkening shadow of World War II, Uranium Wars 
			follows the time's most brilliant scientists as they race to capture 
			nuclear power. Pioneering woman physicist Lise Meitner uncovered nuclear fission but never won the Nobel 
			Prize. Denmark's Niels Bohr sided with the Allies when he held a 
			secret meeting with his protégé and possible Nazi collaborator 
			Werner Heisenberg. Years of dogged research culminated on a 
			racquetball court at the University of Chicago as Italian physicist 
			Enrico Fermi set off the first nuclear chain reaction that led to 
			the building of the atom bomb. Told with flair by one of our best 
			popular science writers, Uranium Wars is a fast paced and vivid 
			narrative about a pivotal moment in history. Amir U. Aczel expertly 
			connects the dots to today, when nations seek nuclear capability and 
			scientists strive to better understand and responsibly manage the 
			most controversial type of energy ever discovered.
       <br/>
       Hardly a day goes by without a major news report about nuclear issues, whether it's the international community's response to Iran's nuclear program or the future of Pakistan's atomic 
			arsenal. At the same time, some politicians and scientists envision 
			a future in which nuclear reactors dot the country, generating 
			electricity that will help break our dependence on fossil fuels. 
			Nuclear energy can help us combat global warming because this power 
			source does not entail the release of carbon into the atmosphere. 
			But the promise of a carbon-free energy source is checked by 
			concerns about the ill effects of nuclear waste, as well as the 
			danger of another disaster like the 1986 meltdown of a nuclear plant 
			in Chernobyl, Ukraine, the human toll of which we have yet to fully 
			quantify.

			Pan (Brill) This book provides a precious chance to take legal perspectives 
			of China's territorial and boundary disputes against the new 
			background of China's increasingly integrating itself into global 
			economic, political and legal systems. Based on international law 
			and China's new policy, the author examines the possibility of using

			engagement, to settle China's territorial and boundary disputes. 
			This book pinpoints the problems and opportunities China is 
			confronting in its attitude to international law and inter-national 
			courts and tribunals. In the light of international law, especially 
			of norms and principles used by the International Court of Justice 
			and other international courts and tribunals, the author creatively 
			proposes a new framework for settlement of China's territorial and 
			boundary disputes. The author is a promising young scholars

        What Is a Just Peace?
       </a>
       Edited by Pierre Allan, Alexis Keller 
			(Oxford University Press) Just War has attracted considerable 
			attention. The words peace and justice are often used together. 
			Surprisingly, however, little conceptual thinking has gone into what 
			constitutes a Just Peace. This book, which includes some of the 
			world's leading scholars, debates and develops the concept of Just 
			Peace. The problem with the idea of a Just Peace is that striving 
			for justice may imply a Just War. In other words, peace and justice 
			clash at times. Therefore, one often starts from a given view of 
			what constitutes justice, but this a priori approach leads - 
			especially when imposed from the outside - straight into discord. 
			This book presents conflicting viewpoints on this question from 
			political, historical, and legal perspectives as well as from a 
			policy perspective. The book also argues that Just Peace should be 
			defined as a process resting on four necessary and sufficient 
			conditions: thin recognition whereby the other is accepted as 
			autonomous; thick recognition whereby identities need to be 
			accounted for; renouncement, requiring significant sacrifices from 
			all parties; and finally, rule, the objectification of a Just Peace 
			by a "text" requiring a common language respecting the identities of 
			each, and defining their rights and duties. This approach based on a 
			language-oriented process amongst directly concerned parties, goes 
			beyond liberal and culturalist perspectives. Throughout the process, 
			negotiators need to build a novel shared reality as well as a new 
			common language allowing for an enduring harmony between previously 
			clashing peoples. It challenges a liberal view of peace founded on 
			norms claiming universal scope. The liberal conception has 
			difficulty in solving conflicts such as civil wars characterized 
			typically by fundamental disagreements between different 
			communities. Cultures make demands that are identity-defining, and 
			some of these defy the "cultural neutrality" that is one of the 
			foundations of liberalism. Therefore, the concept of Just Peace 
			cannot be solved within the liberal tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Just War has attracted considerable attention for centuries, 
			the words peace and justice have been, and are still, often used 
			together. While an old doctrine of Just War exists, surprisingly 
			little conceptual thinking has gone into what constitutes a peace 
			that is a just one. This book debates this problématique and 
			develops the concept of a Just Peace.

		eclipsed ‘religion’ in Western settings remains debatable. What is 
		incontestable is that the language of spirituality, together with 
		practices (most noticeably spiritual, complementary, and alternative 
		medicine), has become a major feature of the sacred dimensions of 
		contemporary modernity. Equally incontestably, spirituality is a growing

         by John Edward Fletcher and Elizabeth Fletcher

			Athanasius Kircher, a German Jesuit in 17th-century Rome, was an enigma.

His correspondence with popes, princes and priests was a window into the restless energy of the period. 
It showed first-hand the seventeenth-century’s struggle for knowledge in astronomy, microscopy, geology,

Kircher’s books reflect the mind-set of 17th-century scholars - endless curiosity and a … read more substantial larding of naiveté: 
Kircher scorned alchemy as the wishful thinking of charlatans, yet believed in dragons.


His life and correspondence provide a key to the transition from the Middle Ages to a new scientific age. This book, though unpublished, has been long quoted and referred to. 
Awaited by scholars and specialists of Kircher, it is finally available with this edition.

          The Existence of God: An Exposition and Application of

         by Stig Børsen Hansen 
					(Quellen Und Studien Zur Philosophie: De Gruyter) This study 
					breaks new ground on the question of the existence of God. 
					It innovatively combines biblical scholarship with an 
					analysis of existence drawn from the writings of the 
					philosopher Gottlob Frege. It shows that the strength of 
					Frege's approach is its emphasis on the notions of proper 
					name and predicate; this in turn sheds new light on 
					important elements of theological language. Finally, the 
					Fregean approach in this book is defended against objections 
					drawn from readings of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus

          The Silent God
         </a>
         by Marjo C. A. Korpel and Johannes C. De 
			Moor (Brill Academic) The silence of God is a 
			recurring theme in modern reflection. It is not only addressed in 
			theology, religious studies and philosophy, but also in literary 
			fiction, film and theatre. The authors show that the concept of a 
			silent deity emerged in the ancient Near East (including Greece). 
			What did the Ancients mean when they assumed that under 
			circumstances their deities remained silent? What reasons are 
			discernable for silence between human beings and their gods? For the 
			first time the close interrelation between the divine and the human 
			in the revelatory process is demonstrated here on the basis 
			of a wealth of translated ancient texts. In an intriguing epilogue, 
			the authors explore the theological consequences of what they have 
			found.

          Paradise in Antiquity: Jewish and Christian Views
         </a>
         by Markus Bockmuehl and Guy G. 
					Stroumsa (Cambridge University Press) The social and intellectual vitality of Judaism and 
					Christianity in antiquity was in large part/ a function of 
					their ability to articulate a viably transcendent hope for 
					the human condition. Narratives of paradise — based on the 
					concrete symbol of the Garden of Delights —came to play a 
					central role for Jews, Christians, and eventually Muslims 
					too.
         <br/>
         These collected essays highlight the multiple 
					hermeneutical perspectives on biblical paradise from Second 
					Temple Judaism and Christian origins to the systematic 
					expositions of Augustine and rabbinic literature, and show 
					that while early Christian and Jewish sources draw on texts 
					from the same Bible, their perceptions of paradise often 
					reflect the highly different structures of the two sister 
					religions. Dealing with a wide variety of texts, these 
					essays explore major themes such as the allegorical and 
					literal interpretations of paradise, the tension between 
					heaven and earth, and paradise's physical location in space 
					and time.

          Constructing Tradition: Means and Myths of Transmission in Western 
			Esotericism
         </a>
         by Andreas Kilcher, Antoine Faivre, Matthias 
			Heiduk, and Philipp Theisohn (Aries Book Series: Brill 
			Academic) The question of constructing tradition, concepts of 
						origin, and memory as well as techniques and practices of knowledge 
						transmission, are central for cultures in general. In 
						esotericism, however, such questions and techniques play 
						an outstanding role and are widely reflected upon, in 
						its literature. Esoteric paradigms not only understand 
						themselves in elaborated mytho-poetical narratives as 
						bearers of "older", "hidden", "higher" knowledge. 
									They also claim their knowledge to be of a 
									particular origin. And they claim this 
									knowledge has been transmitted by particular 
									(esoteric) means, media and groups. 
									Consequently, esotericism not only involves 
									the construction of its own tradition; it 
									can even be understood as a specific form of tradition and transmission. The various 
									studies of the present volume, which 
									contains the papers of a conference held in 
									Tubingen in July 2007, provide an overview 
									of the most important concepts and ways of 
									constructing tradition in esotericism.

          Plato and the Talmud
         </a>
         by Jacob Howland (Cambridge 
			University Press) This innovative study sees the relationship 
			between Athens and Jerusalem through the lens of the Platonic 
			dialogues and the Talmud. Howland argues that these texts are 
			animated by comparable conceptions of the proper roles of inquiry 
			and reasoned debate in religious life, and by a profound awareness 
			of the limits of our understanding of things divine. Insightful 
			readings of Plato's Apology, Euthyphro, and chapter three of 
			tractate Ta'anit explore the relationship of prophets and 
			philosophers, fathers and sons, and gods and men (among other 
			themes), bringing to light the tension between rational inquiry and 
			faith that is essential to the speeches and deeds of both Socrates 
			and the Talmudic sages. In reflecting on the pedagogy of these 
			texts, Howland shows in detail how Talmudic aggadah and Platonic 
			drama and narrative speak to different sorts of readers in seeking 
			mimetically to convey the living ethos of rabbinic Judaism and 
			Socratic philosophizing.

          The Secret History of Western Sexual Mysticism: Sacred Practices and 
			Spiritual Marriage
         </a>
         by Arthur Versluis  (Destiny Books) Beginning with the ancient Greek Mystery traditions, 
			Gnosticism, and the practices in early Christianity, Arthur Versluis 
			uncovers the secret line of Western sexual mysticism that, like the 
			Tantra of the East, seeks transcendence or union with God through 
			sexually charged practices. Throughout antiquity, and right into the 
			present day, sexuality has played an important, if largely hidden, 
			role in religious traditions and practices. This includes not only 
			Christian but also kabbalistic, hermetic, and alchemical currents of 
			sexual mysticism, many discussed together here for the first time.

          Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western 
			Esotericism
         </a>
         edited by Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Jeffrey J. Kripal 
			(Aries: Brill Academic) From rumours about gnostic orgies in 
			antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from 
			the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic 
			practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural 
			translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is 
			rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This 
			volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level 
			specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric 
			without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of 
			expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. 
			While there are few other domains where the imagination may so 
			easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact 
			from fiction--only to find that historical realities are sometimes 
			even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the 
			outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty 
			centuries.

          Popular Religion and Shamanism
         </a>
         by 
									Edited by Ma Xisha and Meng Huiying 
									(Religious Studies in Contemporary China 
									Collection: Brill Academic) addresses 
									two areas of religion within Chinese 
									society; the lay teachings that Chinese 
									scholars term folk or `popular' religion, 
									and shamanism. Each area represents a 
									distinct tradition of scholarship, and the 
									book is therefore split into two parts.
         <br/>
         PART I: Popular Religion discusses the evolution 
									of organized lay movements over an arc often 
									centuries. Its eight chapters focus on three 
									key points: the arrival and integration of 
									new ideas before the Song dynasty, the 
									coalescence of an intellectual and 
									scriptural tradition during the Ming, and 
									the efflorescence of new organizations 
									during the late Qing.
         <br/>
         PART II: Shamanism reflects the revived interest 
									of scholars in traditional beliefs and 
									culture that reemerged with the 'open' 
									policy in China that occurred in the 197os. 
									Two of the essays included in this section 
									address shamanism in northeast China where 
									the traditions played an important role in 
									the cultures of the Manchu, Mongol, Sibe, 
									Daur, Oroqen, Evenki, and Hezhen. The other 
									essay discusses divination rites in a local 
									culture of southwest China.
         <br/>
         Both sections of Popular Religion and 
									Shamanism will introduce Western readers to 
									the ideas of Chinese scholars, not just 
									their data.

			itself to an exposition of the doctrine as such but at times hints 
			at a second sense lying beneath the evident sense, namely esoteric

           This is the second of the five volumes of Brill's Encyclopedia of

           <strong>

           makes available in-depth critical scholarship, and the 
			depth and breadth of information provided in this work are unmatched 
			by any reference work on Hinduism. I should appeal to a wide 
			range of readers. At the foundation of the Encyclopedia is a 
			fascination with a phenomenon that we as humans share, and in the 
			examination of this phenomenon, the emphasis is on critical 
			knowledge. Hinduism as a religious tradition functions on a number 
			of different levels, from the most complex architecture, philosophy, 
			and linguistic activity to the performance of short ritual acts: a 
			woman connecting for a brief moment to a statue of the god Ganesa in 
			a wayside shrine on her way to work, a Hindu holy man performing his 
			morning rituals in the Himalaya, a young boy learning to recite 
			Sanskrit ritual texts at a school for priest education in South 
			India, a dance performance in a temple, an astrologer giving advice 
			to a client, the tying of a short thread to a tree by a pilgrim at a 
			Hindu sacred place, a meeting of the organizational committee of a 
			Hindu temple anywhere in the world, a philosophical discussion at an 
			assembly of learned persons in Benares, artisans making stone 
			sculptures for temples, Vedic sacred formulas and texts recited 
			daily, and manuscripts of Hinduism being preserved in facilities and 
			libraries worldwide. In these and many other ways, the Hindu 
			traditions are performed by hundreds of millions of people every 
			day. The goal of the Encyclopedia is to present the Hindu traditions 
			as they take place on all these levels. Hinduism, it is often 
			observed, has no common church and no common creed, and it is not 
			based on a holy book or a single founder. That may be so, but 
			Hinduism has many organizations, many creeds, many sacred texts, and 
			founders of a number of organizations and knowledge traditions. The 
			vision of this work is to approach the mosaic and network of Hindu 
			traditions in all their multiplicity, and as both historical and 
			contemporary institutions from different angles and in a variety of 
			contexts, and to document a number of connections and networks.

         <p>
          For many scholars whose work is dedicated to understanding the 
			history, structure, and pluralism of Hindu traditions, Hinduism is 
			definitely the world's most exciting religion. This enthusiasm for 
			the subject is displayed in the articles of the Encyclopedia. The 
			articles are clear, comprehensive, interesting and exciting, and 
			they do justice to the Hindu traditions both in the context of 
			ancient civilizations and as global living traditions.

           The Yoga 
			Sutras: An Essential Guide to the Heart of Yoga Philosophy
          </a>
          by 
			Nicolai Bachman ( Sounds True) Open your yoga practice
			with an in-depth
			course on the Sutras of Patanjali. We know there's more to the yogic path than asana, 
			or physical postures, but how do we access the deeper wisdom of yoga 
			philosophy? More than 2,000 years ago, the legendary master 
			Patanjali answered this question in 195 pearls of insight known as 
			the Yoga Sutras. Now Sanskrit and Ayurveda teacher Nicolai Bachman 
			offers The Yoga Sutras, a complete course with a fresh new approach 
			to working with Patanjali's seminal text for guidance and 
			inspiration on your own journey toward clarity and happiness.
         </p>
         <p>
          Why do we react the way we do in certain situations? How can 
			suffering be an opportunity for growth? Why are nonviolence and 
			truth important to a student? Patanjali's sutras offer an 
			illuminating perspective on these questions and more. To help 
			integrate this wisdom into our modern life, Bachman offers a unique 
			approach. Instead of reading each sutra sequentially from beginning 
			to end, he focuses on and discusses 51 key concepts. By exploring 
			these principles with him and learning to chant the sutras in 
			Sanskrit, the essence of yoga philosophy is revealed—helping us open 
			to its heart and soul. The Yoga Sutras invites you to discover a 
			variety of practical tools and heartfelt insights for transforming 
			your practice, including:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           A 336-page color-illustrated workbook with a concise history 
				of yoga and the sutras, in-depth explanation of key themes, 
				translation of all 195 sutras, and a complete glossary of 
				Sanskrit terms for quick reference
          </li>
          <li>
           Six sessions full of insights to further your learning about 
				yoga's essential principles
          </li>
          <li>
           A guided reading on CD of the complete sutras with 
				pronunciation instructions for following along
          </li>
          <li>
           Fifty-one study cards to encourage reflection of each 
				concept and inspire action
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          When you immerse yourself in Patanjali's sutras, the heart of 
			yoga—and what yoga means for you personally—will unveil itself in 
			new and profound ways. Whether you're a seasoned teacher or a 
			student looking to go deeper with your practice, this essential 
			course offers a treasury of teachings to help realize the"outer joy 
			and inner happiness" of yoga.

           DRAWING ON A VAST ARRAY OF HISTORICAL AND biographical sources, this volume elaborates Tibetan political

			that the 195o incursion by the Chinese was an invasion of a 
			sovereign country. The author situates Tibet's relations with a 
			series of Chinese, Manchurian, and Mongolian empires in terms of the 
			preceptor-patron relationship, an essentially religious connection 
			in which Tibetan religious figures offered spiritual instruction to 
			the contemporaneous emperor or other militarily powerful figure in 
			exchange for protection and religious patronage. Simultaneously, 
			this volume serves as an introduction to many aspects of Tibetan 
			culture, society, and especially religion. The book includes a

          edited by Louise M. Antony (Oxford University Press) 
			Atheists are frequently demonized as arrogant intellectuals,

			an "anything goes" lifestyle. Now, in this revealing volume, 
			nineteen leading philosophers open a window on the inner life of 
			atheism, shattering these common stereotypes as they reveal how they

			atheists, providing a portrait that will surprise most readers. Many 
			of the authors, for example, express great affection for particular 
			religious traditions, even as they explain why they cannot, in good 
			conscience, embrace them. None of the contributors dismiss religious 
			belief as stupid or primitive, and several even express regret that 
			they cannot, or can no longer, believe. Perhaps more important, in 
			these reflective pieces, they offer fresh insight into some of the 
			oldest and most difficult problems facing the human mind and spirit. 
			For instance, if God is dead, is everything permitted?

			that secular life can provide rewards as great and as rich as 
			religious life. A naturalistic understanding of the human condition 
			presents a set of challenges--to pursue our goals without illusions, 
			to act morally without hope of reward--challenges that can impart a 
			lasting value to finite and fragile human lives. Collectively, these 
			essays highlight the richness of atheistic belief--not only as a 
			valid alternative to religion, but as a profoundly fulfilling and

          by Sharon Vance(Brill's Series in Jewish Studies:Brill

			Tangier, traumatized the Jewish community and inspired a literary 
			response in Morocco and beyond. This study focuses on works written in the first century after her death in Hebrew, 
			Judeo-Arabic, Judeo- Spanish-Spanish and French that tell her story 
			and interpret its meaning. The author places both the event and the 
			texts that narrate it in their historical context and shows how its 
			significance changed in each language and literary setting. The 
			texts, prose and poetic laments by North African rabbis and a 
			romantic feuilleton from the Judeo-Spanish press, and their 
			historical context reveal the complex relations between Jews and

					converted to Christianity - to confiscate and burn all 
					Jewish post-biblical literature in the Holy Roman Empire in

						This is a new presentation of the

									a work of formal philosophy, but much of 
									what it says is relevant to philosophical 
									enquiry of the kind that has been going on 
									recently. In particular, the Talmud has 
									original ideas about the relation

									particular community. This leads into 
									discussion about the relation between 
									morality and ritual, and also about the 
									epistemological role of tradition. Governing 
									the discussion is a theory of logic that 
									differs significantly from Greek logic. 
									Talmudic logic is one of analogy, not 
									classification, and is peculiarly suitable 
									for the discussion of moral and legal human 
									situations.

			businessman and aspiring scholar from a distinguished Ghetto dynasty 
			who sought to parlay his alleged mastery of astrology, alchemy, and

           by L. Stephen Cook
          </span>
          (Texts &amp; Studies in 
			Ancient Judaism: Mohr Siebeck) Recent decades have witnessed a virtual explosion of studies 
			examining various aspects of Second Temple Judaism, and no slowdown 
			appears on the horizon. These studies seek to elucidate, among other 
			things, the religious and historical situation from which 
			Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism emerged. As part of this ongoing 
			effort, the present work seeks to identify and examine attitudes 
			about the status of prophets and prophecy in this complex phase of 
			Jewish history.
          <br/>
          A variety of Jewish texts from the Second Temple and rabbinic 
			periods seem to reflect the view that Israelite prophecy ceased 
			during the Persian period, around the beginning of the Second Temple 
			era. Up until the twentieth century, scholars generally regarded 
			these ancient texts as presenting a relatively uniform, consistent 
			picture of the historical process of the cessation of prophecy. Some 
			authors still hold to this assessment; in recent decades, however, 
			others have pointed to numerous ancient texts which refer to 
			prophetic activity occurring well beyond the point of its supposed 
			cessation. These scholars therefore hold that the claim that 
			prophecy ceased was simply one view in antiquity, and not 
			necessarily representative of a larger consensus. According to these 
			authors, the evidence of prophetic activity in the Second Temple 
			period either contradicts ancient claims of prophecy's demise, or 
			else exposes these claims as polemical attempts to counter belief in 
			the legitimacy of prophecy during this period. Contemporary 
			scholarship is therefore divided on whether to regard the sources 
			which allege the absence of prophets/prophecy as reliable 
			characterizations of the religious atmosphere of the Second Temple 
			period.

        Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla's Hermeneutics
       </a>
       by Elke Morlok (Mohr 
			Siebeck) Elke Morlok deals with the hermeneutics of R. Joseph 
			Gikatilla, one of the most outstanding and influential kabbalists of 
			medieval Jewish mysticism. His literary creativity falls onto the 
			last decades of the 13th century, when very innovative ideas on 
			kabbalah and its hermeneutics were developed and formulated for the 
			first time. The author analyzes several key concepts throughout his 
			writings such as his ideas on letter combination, symbol, memory, 
			imagination and ritual and their varying functions within the 
			hermeneutical and theosophic structures that underlie Gikatilla's 
			approach. With the application of methods derived from modern 
			theories on language and literature, she tries to create the basis 
			for a fruitful encounter between medieval mystical hermeneutics and 
			postmodern hermeneutical approaches. As Gikatilla incorporates two 
			main trends of kabbalistic thinking during the medieval period, he 
			was one of the most valuable sources for Christian thinkers 
			interested in medieval kabbalistic thought.

		and C.K.M. von Stuckrad (Aries Book Series: Brill) The persistence of kabbalistic groups in the 
								twentieth century has largely been ignored or 
								underestimated by scholars of religion. Only 
								recently have scholars began to turn their 
								attention to the many-facetted roles that 
								kabbalistic doctrines and schools have played in 
								nineteenth- and twentieth-century culture. 
								Often, and necessarily, this new interest and openness went along 
								with a contextualization and revaluation of 
								earlier scholarly approaches to kabbalah. This 
								volume brings together leading representatives 
								of this ongoing debate in order to break new 
								ground for a better understanding and 
								conceptualization of the role of kabbalah in 
								modern religious, intellectual, and political 
								discourse.

        A Journey into the Zohar: An Introduction to the Book of Radiance
       </a>
       by Nathan Wolski (State University of New York Press: SUNY) The 
			crowning work of medieval Kabbalah, the Zohar is unlike any other 
			work in the Jewish canon. Written in Aramaic, the Zohar contains 
			complex mystical exegesis as well as a delightful epic narrative 
			about the Companions--a group of sages who wander through 
			second-century Israel discussing the Torah while encountering 
			children, donkey drivers, and other surprising figures who reveal 
			profound mysteries to them. Nathan Wolski offers original 
			translations of episodes involving this mystical fellowship and goes 
			on to provide a sustained reading of each. With particular emphasis 
			on the literary and performative dimensions of the composition, 
			Wolski takes the reader on a journey through the central themes and 
			motifs of the zoharic world: kabbalistic hermeneutics, the structure 
			of divinity, the nature of the soul, and, above all, the 
			experiential core of the Zohar--the desire to be saturated and 
			intoxicated with the flowing fluids of divinity. A Journey into the 
			Zohar opens the mysterious, wondrous, and at times bewildering 
			universe of one of the masterpieces of world mystical literature to 
			a wider community of scholars, students, and general readers alike.

        , the jewel in the

        Hellner-Eshed's book investigates the flow of this river in the

       (Numen Book 
			Series: Brill Academic Publishers) Until 1806, Rabbi Nahman of 
			Bratslav (1772-1810) disseminated his thoughts on redemption through 
			homilies. In 1806, however, Nahman chose the genre of tales as an 
			additional and innovative means of religious discourse. An academic 
			close reading of all of the tales, known as Sippurey Ma'asiyot, has 
			not yet been undertaken. As the first comprehensive scholarly work 
			on the whole selection of tales and contrary to previous 
			scholarship, this book does not reduce the tales to biographical 
			expressions of Nahman's tormented soul and messianic aspirations. 
			Instead, it treats them as religious literature where the concept of 
			"intertextuality" is considered essential to explain how Nahman 
			defines his theology of redemption and invites his listeners and 
			readers to appropriate his religious world-view.

       (Gorgias Press) After the 
			establishment of the Zoharic corpus amongst leading rabbis, no major 
			changes took place in Jewish esoterism until the middle of the 16th 
			century, when in Safed (in Upper Galilee, Palestine; present-day 
			Zefat, Israel) a religious centre of extreme importance for Judaism 
			was established, which was mainly inspired by teachers coming from 
			families expelled from Spain. Until the expulsion of the Jews from 
			Spain (1492) and during the two generations that followed it, the 
			Kabbalistic literary output had certainly been abundant, in Spain 
			till the expulsion as well as in Italy and the Middle East; but it 
			was primarily a matter of systematizing or even popularizing the 
			Zohar or of extending the speculation already developed in the 13th 
			century; there were also some attempts at reconciling philosophy and 
			Kabbala. It should be noted that even the traditionalist theologians 
			adopted a careful and rather reserved attitude toward Kabbala.

        Esotericism at the University of Amsterdam
       </a>
       by Wouter J. Hanegraaff and

			the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Amsterdam, focused on 
			the history of Western esotericism from the Renaissance to the present. The 
			label "Western esotericism" refers here to a complex of historical 
			currents such as, notably, the Hermetic philosophy of the 
			Renaissance, mystical, magical, alchemical and astrological currents, Christian kabbalah, Paracelsianism, 
			Rosicrucianism, Christian theosophy, and the many occultist and 
			related esoteric currents that developed in their wake during the 
			19th and the 20th centuries. This complex of "alternative" religious 
			currents is studied from a critical historical and interdisciplinary perspective, with the intention of studying the 
			roles that they have played in the history of Western culture.
       <br/>
       In the past ten years, the chair for History of Hermetic 
			Philosophy and Related Currents has succeeded in establishing itself 
			as the most important center for study and teaching in this domain, 
			and has strongly contributed to the establishment of Western esotericism as a recognized 
			academic field of research. This volume is published at the occasion 
			of the 10th anniversary. It contains a history of the creation and 
			development of the chair, followed by articles on aspects of Western 
			esotericism by the previous and current staff members, contributions by students and Ph.D. students about 
			the study program, and reflections by international top specialists 
			about the field of research and its academic development.

        Echoes from the Gnosis: 100th Anniversary Edition of the Spiritual 
		Classics by G.R.S. Mead
       </a>
       edited by John Algeo, 
		introduction Robert Gilbert, Commentary by Stephan Hoeller (Quest Books) 
		Long before the mid-twentieth-century discovery of the Nag Hammadi 
		Library, G. R. S. Mead had translated ancient Gnostic texts. Here in one 
		book is the entire collection of his eleven volumes first published 
		between 1906 and 1908, including "The Hymn of Jesus" and "The Wedding 
		Song of Wisdom."
       <br/>
       Each Gnostic text has added historical background, source 
		information, literary comment, and spiritual interpretation. Mead, who 
		devoted his life to esoteric studies and was a pioneer in the Gnostic 
		revival, uniquely understood the complex symbolism of his subject. The 
		reader may be surprised to learn that some of these texts were 
		originally not books, but instead initiatory mystery rituals.
       <br/>
       Editor John Algeo preserves Mead's own inspired language. To enhance 
		the texts for today's readers, the volume includes new explanatory 
		essays by contemporary Gnostic Stephan Hoeller and a biography by Robert 
		Gilbert, a world authority on Mead.

        The Art and Science of Hand Reading: Classical Methods for

       by Ellen Goldberg, Dorian 
			Bergen (Destiny Books) In this comprehensive guide to hand reading, 
			based on Ellen Goldberg’s 40 years of teaching palmistry and the 
			Western Mystery tradition, the authors make the powerful insights of 
			the hand accessible in an inviting and user-friendly manner. The 
			book presents the character traits and personality archetypes 
			associated with each of the seven mounts of the palm and shows how 
			to determine which are most influential in the nature of the 
			individual. The mount archetypes reveal the lifestyle, love, sex, 
			and marriage preferences; the best career choices; and the unique 
			strengths and weaknesses for each person. The book also examines 
			other factors that enhance the qualities revealed by the mount 
			types, including the flexibility of the hand, texture of the skin, 
			and the shapes of the fingers, fingertips, and nails. The meaning of 
			each major and minor line is described in detail as well as the 
			influence the person’s own mind has in healing defects and obstacles 
			found on their lines. The authors also provide accurate timing 
			guides for each line, making it possible to locate specific events 
			and to see how your lines change over time.

       Palmistry is a science and a universal language. The hand tells a 
			story about your talents, relationships, health, and how you feel 
			about yourself. It reveals periods of ease or challenge in your 
			life, and it speaks about your weaknesses and the traits you need to 
			develop. As you change, so do your hands, reflecting the progress 
			you have made.

      </p>
      <p>
       Presenting the hand as a guide to self-fulfillment, The Art and 
			Science of Hand Reading incorporates correspondences to other 
			mystical sciences such as astrology, Kabbalah, the Hermetic 
			teachings, and archetypal psychology. It also includes practical 
			examples and more than 600 illustrations to show how to integrate 
			the meanings of each part of the hand to form a complete picture of 
			your inner psychology and your ever-changing destiny.

        Ancient Egyptian Demonology. Studies on the Boundaries between the 
		Demonic and the Divine in Egyptian Magic
       </a>
       by P. Kousoulis
		(Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta: Peeters)
						In the Egyptian context, what we term magic and demon, 
						drawing on our own cultural heritage, are not seen as 
						negative aspects of cultural practice and 
						conceptualisation. Similarly, the Egyptian equivalents 
						do not carry the pejorative connotations borne by the 
						modern terms and their Greek antecedents; magic and 
						demons can be forces for good as well as evil. Indeed, 
						the practice of magic and the conceptualisation of 
						personified demonic agents are central to the Egyptian 
						understanding of the workings of the world from the very 
						continuation of the cosmos itself down to the 
						vicissitudes of existence faced by individuals. In 
						particular, the broader practice of magic and 
						articulation of the involvement of demonic agency form 
						one of the crucial links in Ancient Egypt between 
						individual existence on the human level and the level of 
						nature or the cosmos, the realm of the gods. Unlike, 
						though, the explicit recognition of the term demon in 
						the ancient Greek language and religion, as the 
						intermediary between god and mortals, the majority of 
						the demonic names in the Egyptian literature do not 
						possess an apparent ontological essence, or a clearly 
						defined denotation. Their characteristics and role 
						depended momentously on the verbal and performative 
						ritual environment they were part of. The relation 
						between the name of a demon and its cosmic-natural 
						personification is not contradictory as it may seem, but 
						it is closely interwoven in a well established ritual 
						framework of words and actions. This multi-authored 
						volume of 10 essays comprises an up-to-date 
						authorization account of many aspects of ancient 
						Egyptian demonology, including the multiple persona of 
						the demonic or name vs. identity in the Egyptian 
						formation of the demonic, nightmares and underworld 
						demons, dream rituals and magic, categories of demonic 
						entities and the vague distinction between the divine 
						and the demonic in Egyptian cosmology and ritual, the 
						theological and demonic aspects of Egyptian magic, 
						demons as reflections of human society. Contributors 
						include Paul John Frandsen, Hedvig Gyory, Joachim 
						Friedrich Quack, Yvan Koenig, Panagiotis Kousoulis, Alan 
						Lloyd, Robert Ritner, Alessandro Roccati, Kasia 
						Szpakowska and Penelope Wilson.

        Geomancy in Theory and Practice
       </a>
       by Stephen Skinner (Golden Hoard Press) Geomancy - divination by earth - ranks alongside the 
					tarot, astrology and the I Ching as a major form of 
					divination. Since the Renaissance it has largely fallen out 
					of favour for want of a generally available book on its 
					practice. This is the first and most comprehensive book in 
					English to cover the full historical background and practice 
					of divinatory geomancy, and will therefore be invaluable to 
					all those interested in geomancy, divination, and astrology. 
					It is the only complete history in any language, covering 
					geomancy's various manifestations in different cultures, as 
					well as being a practical manual showing how to cast and 
					interpret geomantic figures.
       <br/>
       Drawing on material from Latin, French, German and Arabic 
					sources, Stephen Skinner explores the roots of geomancy in 
					the Islamic raml divination of northern Africa, which lead 
					to Fa, IA and voodoo divinatory practices on the West Coast 
					and sikidy in Madagascar.
       <br/>
       He examines the impact Islamic geomancy had on medieval 
					Europe, where it rose to prominence and became, after 
					astrology, the prime method of divination. The part it 
					played in Renaissance thinking and in the great astrological 
					revival of the nineteenth century is followed by an 
					examination of its use in the Hermetic Order of the Golden 
					Dawn and its declining influence in the twentieth century, 
					only to be revived again in the last two decades.
       <br/>
       The second section of the book is concerned with the 
					practice, manipulation and generation of geomantic figures 
					as standardized in Europe, and gives practical examples as a 
					guide to the interpretation and practice of the art. It also 
					covers astrogeomany which uses the Houses of astrology in 
			geomancy.
       <span>
        There is really no better work in English on the 
					history and the direct practice of geomancy. It is a 
					definite supplement to astrological practice and can be 
					adapted to the 16 court cards of the tarot as a subsystem of 
					divining.

       Sepher Raziel 
			(also called Liber Salomenk) is not the same as the Hebrew Sepher 
			Raziel ha-Melakh. It is a full grimoire in the Solomonic tradition 
			from a 1564 century English manuscript, derived from Latin sources. 
			As such it is one of the earliest grimoires produced in this series. 
			It begins with directions for making the parchment, pen and ink of 
			Art, required to write the names. It contains seven separate 
			Treatises:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Liber Clavis which is concerned with astrology and its 
				correct use in magic, something long forgotten by modern 
				astrologers, with the precise interactions between planets, 
				Signs and Houses.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Ala outlines in four sections the magical virtues of 
				stones, herbs and beasts, and words.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Tractatus Thymiamatus explains why incense is essential 
				to magical operations, and the effect of various incenses on the 
				spirits, with a list of the key perfumes and suffumigations. An 
				Appendix gives the modern and botanical names.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Treatise of Times gives details of the correct hours of 
				the day and night for each operation, with associated angels and 
				the proper names of the Sun, Moon and planets to be used in each 
				season. This is something left out of almost all other grimoires.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Treatise on Purity explains the exact preparations, and 
				the reasons for ritual purity.
       </li>
       <li>
        Samaim is a treatise on the seven Heavens, with the names of 
				their angels.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Book of Virtues and Miracles is a treatise on the 
				Semiforas, the names of God, and how they are to be used in 
				invocation to produce miraculous results.

								Jewish Mysticism and Magic: An

								of mysticism in Judaism and the associated 
								development of the Jewish magical tradition.
       <br/>
       Using the methodology of structural analysis 
								and the theory of structural transformation, 
								texts of early and late antiquity are analysed 
								with reference to symbolic rites and rituals. 
								Scriptural and Talmudic texts resonate with 
								ideas of 'sacred and mundane' and ritual 'purity 
								and impurity' and reflect a worldview where an 
								omnipotent God governed a cosmos in which 
								disorder vied with order. Particular features 
								include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Discussion of the relationship between 
								Babylonian culture and Jewish laws and customs.
       </li>
       <li>
        Examination of how, paradoxically, esoteric 
								beliefs attained and retained powerful influence 
								on Jewish culture.
       </li>
       <li>
        Analysis of texts showing the influence of 
								early cultural constructs on Jewish magical 
								spells and formulae and the persistence of their 
								symbolic significance.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This wide-ranging study provides a unique 
								anthropological perspective on Jewish mysticism 
								and magic and will be essential reading for 
								students and scholars who are interested in 
								Jewish studies, anthropology and mysticism.

       <i>
        The Clavis or Key to the Magic of Solomon
       </i>
       is one of several notebooks from the estate of Ebenezer 
						Sibley, transcribed under the direction of Frederic 
						Hockley (1808-1885). Sibley was a prominent physician 
						and an influential author, who complemented his 
						scientific studies with writings on the “deeper truths” 
						including magic, astrology, alchemy, and hypnotherapy. 
						Both Sibley and Hockley were major inspirations in the 
						occult revival of the past two centuries, influencing 
						A.E. Waite, S.L. Mathers, Aleister Crowley, as well as 
						the Golden Dawn, Rosicrucian, and Masonic movements. 
						This collection reflects Sibley’s teachings on the 
						practical use of celestial influences and harmonies.
       <i>
        The Clavis
       </i>
       contains clear and systematic 
						instructions for constructing magical tools and 
						pentacles for many practical purposes. It includes eight 
						separate magical texts: The Mysterious Ring, Experiments 
						of the Spirits, Birto, Vassago, Agares, Bealpharos, The 
						Wheel of Wisdom, and the Complete Book of Magic Science. 
						The manuscript reproduced here is the most accurate and 
						complete known, very beautifully and carefully written 
						complete with extraordinary hand-colored seals and 
						colored handwritten text. 282 color pages with a color

			From 2002-2008, three research groups from the departments of 
			systematic theology and church history at the Faculty of Theology, 
			K.U.Leuven, joined forces in an interdisciplinary project, entitled 
			"Orthodoxy: Process and Product". The aim of the project was a

			determination of truth in church and theology". The present volume 
			contains contributions from all senior members of the project 
			research group. The contributions are the result of a research

			truth as such, and the process of determination of theological truth 
			was approached from many different angles. Thus, questions from 
			philosophy, systematic theology and history of church and theology 
			are discussed, including such themes as the implications of various 
			philosophical theories of truth for theology, the question of 
			religious pluralism and its ramifications for theological 
			truth-claims, theological truth claims in the thought of Gregory of 
			Nyssa, Augustine, John Driedo, and at the Second Vatican Council. In 
			addition, the meta-question of the relationship between the 
			historical and the systematic aspects of theological truth and the 
			way in which the historical and systematic theological disciplines 
			interact play an important role in this volume.

        The Unlikely Buddhologist: Tiantai Buddhism in Mou Zongsan's New 
			Confucianism
       </a>
       by Jason Clower (Modern Chinese 
			Philosophy: Brill Academic) Mou Zongsan (1909-1995) was such a seminal, polymathic figure 
			that scholars of Asian philosophy and religion will be absorbing his 
			influence for at least a generation. Drawing on expertise in 
			Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist, and modern Western thought, Mou built a 
			system of "New Confucian" philosophy aimed at answering one of the 
			great questions: "What is the relationship between value and being?" 
			However, though Mou acknowledged that he derived his key concepts 
			from Tiantai Buddhist philosophy, it remains unclear exactly how and 
			why he did so. In response, this book investigates Mou's 
			buddhological writings in the context of his larger corpus and 
			explains how and why he incorporated Buddhist ideas selectively into 
			his system. Written extremely accessibly, it provides a 
			comprehensive unpacking of Mou's ideas about Buddhism, Confucianism, 
			and metaphysics with the precision needed to make them available for 
			critical appraisal.

        Karl Barth's Dialogue With Catholicism in Gottingen &amp; Munster: Its Signifigance 
for His Doctrine of God
       </a>
       <span>
        by Amy Marga
       </span>
       (Beitrage Zur 
Histoischen Theologie: Mohr Siebek) Amy Marga studies Karl Barth's early encounter with Roman Catholic theology during 
						the 1920s, especially seen in his seminal set of 
						dogmatic lectures given in Gottingen, and his second set 
						of dogmatic lectures, given in Münster and which remain 
						unpublished. Her analysis demonstrates his search for a 
						concept of God's objectivity — Gegenständlichkeit —which 
						would not be dependent upon philosophically-laden 
						concepts such as the analogia entis, but which would 
						rather be anchored in God's being alone. The author 
						shows that Roman Catholicism, especially the thought of 
						Erich Przywara, became the key interlocutor that helped 
						Barth bring this clarity to his doctrine of revelation 
						and the triune God.
       <br/>
       At no time in Karl Barth's long career did Roman 
						Catholicism play a more crucial role for him than in the 
						1920s. This decade saw Barth deliver two out of his 
						three sets of lectures on dogmatic theology, the 
						Gottingen and Münster cycles, both of which directly 
						engaged Roman Catholic thought (the third cycle of 
						lectures makes up the Church Dogmatics). Roman 
						Catholicism became a conversation partner that Barth 
						encountered with a directness and concreteness that was 
						unprecedented in his day, and it acted as a conduit for 
						his retrieval of Reformation theology for modern 
						Protestantism. This study investigates the ways in which 
						Barth engaged Catholicism in the decades of the 1920s, 
						especially on several pivotal, material points, such as 
						God's concrete and objective presence in the creaturely 
						sphere, the event of revelation as an act of 
						reconciliation, and the correspondence that exists 
						between human knowledge of God and God's own, triune 
						knowledge. These material issues, on which Barth found 
						clarity and depth through the encounter with Roman 
						Catholicism, led him to what he saw as the heart of the 
						Protestant-Catholic divide: the doctrine of God.

        Major and eventually revolutionary translation of a central work in 
			medieval Western theology.
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the centrality of Peter Lombard's work in the history of 
			the Western academic tradition, very little is known about his life. 
			The earliest unimpeach­able reference occurs in a letter of St. 
			Bernard of Clairvaux, of around 1138— 1140, introducing him to the 
			abbot of St. Victor in Paris. By 1144, a poet in far-off Bavaria 
			could list him as one of the theological luminaries of the Parisian 
			schools. His major work, the four books of the Sentences, was 
			written in the mid twelfth century, and as early as the 1160s, the 
			text was glossed and commented on in the schools. There is hardly a 
			theologian of note throughout the rest of the Middle Ages who did 
			not write a commentary on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet in spite of its importance in Western intellectual history 
			and its capacity to excite many generations of students and 
			teachers, the Sentences has received little attention in more recent 
			times. Indeed, it has been called 'one of the least read of the 
			world's great books.' The form of the work has proved misleading, 
			not least to modern readers. One recurring question is whether Peter 
			could be called an author at all, since he seems to be a mere 
			compiler of the works of the Fathers and other universally accepted 
			ecclesiastical writers. But it would be misleading to describe 
			Peter's efforts as mere anthologizing. Rather, his Sentences can be 
			likened to a modern legal casebook and the patristic citations in it 
			to legal precedents. In other words, they serve as the binding 
			authorities which collectively provide the matter for the normative 
			elaboration of the Christian faith. This laborious activity of 
			collecting sentences from ancient works and framing new ones 
			occurred in the classroom. In short, the effort to identify and 
			point out the coherence of the Christian tradition was inseparable 
			from the work of teaching. Technique, rationality, and dialectic 
			were emphasized, not for their own sake, but to bring the tradition 
			alive and make it relevant to students and the larger communities 
			they would serve.

       Volume One makes available for the first time in English a full 
			translation of Book 1 of the Sentences. It consists of forty-eight 
			Distinctions, the bulk of which deal with God in his transcendence 
			and with the mystery of the Trinity. The person of God the Father is 
			the topic in Distinction iv, that of God the Son in v—ix, that of 
			God the Holy Spirit in x—xviii. Distinctions xix—xxxiv are deeply 
			concerned with the language that can be used in describing the 
			Trinity and the relations among the divine persons. The remaining 
			distinctions deal with the divine attributes as they become manifest 
			in God's action "toward creatures. An important concern is the 
			preservation of God's sovereign freedom and the avoidance of any 
			confusion regarding the absolute transcendence of God, despite his 
			graceful self-disclosure in creation and revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Volume Two makes available for the first time in English a full 
			translation of the forty-four Distinctions of Book 2. In the first 
			Peter sets out a definition of creation and ponders the reasons 
			which God may have had for engaging in it. Angels, their creation, 
			nature, fall, ranks, and ministries are the subject of Distinctions 
			2-11. Distinctions 12-15 set out an hexaemeron, or an account of the 
			six days of creation as described in Genesis. The next five 
			Distinctions concentrate on the creation of man and woman and the 
			state of human beings before their sinful fall, including their 
			manner of procreation. Distinctions 21-29, organized around the 
			fall, are de­voted to human psychology, freedom of choice, and 
			grace. In Distinctions 30-33 the focus is on original sin, its 
			transmission by the current mode of procreation, its remission in 
			baptism. And the Book concludes in Distinctions 34-44 with a 
			de­tailed analysis of actual sin and how it occurs by free choice in 
			the diminished condition of human freedom after the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Volume Three makes available for the first time in English a full 
			translation of Book 3 of the Sentences. The first twenty-two of its 
			forty Distinctions deal with the mystery of the Word made flesh: 
			Christ's incarnation, passion, and death, and the consequent 
			restoration of humankind. With the question of whether Christ had 
			the virtues of faith, hope, and charity, a transition is made from 
			Chris­tology to a consideration of the virtues; these belong in this 
			Book principally be­cause the Christian is called to live them in 
			imitation of Christ, who embodies all of them perfectly. The last 
			four Distinctions outline the Decalogue in the context of the two 
			commandments given by Christ regarding the love of God and neighbour. 
			The Book closes by asserting the superiority of the Gospel over the 
			Law of the Old Testament.

      </p>
      <p>
       Book 3 closed with a reflection on the relative 
						inadequacy of the Old Law, because what it commanded 
						could not be done well or easily in the absence of 
						grace. While the sacraments of the Old Law were only 
						signs, the sacraments of the Church are also the 
						principal instruments of that grace now freely available 
						to Christians. These sacraments are the main subject of 
						Book 4, taking up forty-two of its fifty Distinctions: 
						Baptism is treated in Distinctions 2-6, confirmation in 
						7, the Eucharist in 8-13, penance in 14-22, extreme 
						unction in 23, sacred orders in 24 and 25, and marriage 
						in 26-42. The Book concludes with eight Distinctions on 
						the last things - the resurrection of the body, 
						purgation, hell, the last judgement, and eternity.

       by Hee-Sung Keel (Louvain

			Eckhart (1260?-1328) is undoubtedly the most important thinker in

			and revolutionary affirmation of a perfect divine-human unity

			it gave rise to, inspired a wealth of profound spiritual insights 
			that continue to challenge the reader of his sermons today.

        brings 
					together twenty-six essays by William C. Chittick, renowned

					1975 and 2011, most of these essays are not readily

        Chittick draws upon the writings of towering figures such as 
					Ibn al-`Arabi, Rumi, and Mulla Sadra, as well as other 
					important, but lesser-known thinkers, as he engages with a 
					wide variety of topics, such as the nature of being and 
					knowledge, the relationship between love and scriptural 
					hermeneutics, the practical and theoretical dimensions of 
					Islamic mysticism, the phenomenon of religious diversity, 
					and the ecological crisis.

        Ibn al-'Arabi's Barzakh: The Concept of the Limit and the Relationship between 
God and the World
       </a>
       by Salman H. Bashier (SUNY: State University of New York 
Press) This book explores how Ibn al-'Arabi (1165-1240) used the concept 
			of barzakh (the Limit) to deal with the philosophical problem of the 
			relationship between God and the world, a major concept disputed in 
			ancient and medieval Islamic thought. The term "barzakh" indicates 
			the activity or actor that differentiates between things and that, 
			paradoxically, then provides the context of their unity. Author 
			Salman H. Bashier looks at early thinkers and shows how the 
			synthetic solutions they developed provided the groundwork for Ibn 
			al-'Arabi's unique concept of barzakh. Bashier discusses Ibn al-'Arabi's 
			development of the concept of barzakh ontologically through the 
			notion of the Third Thing and epistemologically through the notion 
			of the Perfect Man, and compares Ibn al-'Arabi's vision with 
			Plato's.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Salmon H. Bashier has rightly identified the importance of the 
			concept of the Limit (barzakh), a central theme in Ibn al-'Arabi's 
			thought, and situates the concept in two new contexts: earlier 
			Islamic thought as a whole, and the larger Western philosophic 
			tradition. It is a worthy ambition." —John Walbridge

       <span>
        by Salman H. Bashier (SUNY: 
						State University of New York Press) In this innovative 
						work, Salman H. Bashier challenges traditional views of 
						Islamic philosophy. While Islamic thought from the 
						crucial medieval period is often depicted as a 
						rationalistic elaboration on Aristotelian philosophy and 
						an attempt to reconcile it with the Muslim religion, 
						Bashier puts equal emphasis on the influence of Plato's 
						philosophical mysticism. This shift encourages a new 
						reading of Islamic intellectual tradition, one in which 
						boundaries between philosophy, religion, mysticism, and 
						myth are relaxed. Bashier shows the manner in which 
						medieval Islamic philosophers reflected on the relation 
						between philosophy and religion as a problem that is 
						intrinsic to philosophy and shows how their 
						deliberations had the effect of redefining the very 
						limits of their philosophical thought. The problems of 
						the origin of human beings, human language, and the 
						world in Islamic philosophy are discussed. Bashier 
						highlights the importance of Ibn Tufayl's
        <i>
         Hayy Ibn 
						Yaqzan,
        </i>
        a landmark work often overlooked by 
						scholars, and the thought of the great Sufi mystic Ibn 
						al-Arabi to the mainstream of Islamic philosophy.

       Opposition and Legitimacy in the Ottoman Empire:

      </a>
      <span>
       by Florian 
					Riedler
      </span>
      (SOAS/Routledge Studies on the Middle East: 
					Routledge) This book looks at opposition to the Ottoman 
					government in the second half of the nineteenth century, 
					examining a number of key political conspiracies and how these relate to an existing 
			political culture. In his detailed analysis of these conspiracies, 
			the author offers a new perspective on an important and well 
			researched period of Ottoman history.
      <br/>
      A close reading of police records on five conspiracies offers the opportunity to analyse this opposition in great detail, giving 
			special attention to the different groups of political actors in 
			these conspiracies that often did not come from the established 
			political elites. Florian Riedler investigates how their background 
			of class and education, but also their individual life experiences 
			influenced their aims and strategies, their political styles as well 
			as their ways of thinking on political legitimacy. In contrast, the 
			reaction of the authorities to these conspiracies reveals the 
			official understanding of Ottoman legitimacy.
      <br/>
      The picture that emerges of the political culture of opposition 
			during the second half of the nineteenth century offers a unique 
			contribution to our understanding of the great changes in the 
			political system of the Ottoman Empire at the time. As such, it will 
			be of great interest to scholars of Middle Eastern history, 
			political history, and the Ottoman Empire.

      The Akhbar al-dawla al-saljuqiyya is one of the key

					on the pre-modern history of the Middle East and the Turkish 
					peoples.
      <br/>
      The text is a chronicle of the Seljuq dynasty as it 
					emerged within the Iranian lands in the eleventh and twelfth 
					centuries, dominating the Middle Eastern lands, from Turkey 
					and Syria to Iran and eastern Afghanistan. During this 
					formative period in the central and eastern Islamic lands,

					Middle Eastern history and is an important addition to the 
					existing literature on the Seljuq dynasty.

       Court Cultures in the Muslim World: Seventh to Nineteenth

      </a>
      by Albrecht Fuess and Jan-Peter Hartung  
					(SOAS/Routledge Studies on the Middle East: Routledge) 
					Courts and the complex phenomenon of the courtly society 
					have received intensified interest in academic research over 
					recent decades; however, the field of Islamic court culture 
					has so far been overlooked. This book provides a comparative 
					perspective on the history of courtly culture in Muslim 
					societies from the earliest times to the nineteenth 
					century, and presents an extensive collection of images of 
					courtly life and architecture within the Muslim realm.
      <br/>
      The thematic methodology employed by the contributors 
					underlines their inter-disciplinary and comprehensive 
					approach to issues of politics and patronage from across the 
					Islamic world stretching from Cordoba to India. Themes range 
					from the religious legitimacy of Muslim rulers, 
					terminologies for court culture in Oriental languages, 
					Muslim concepts of space for royal representation, 
					accessibility of rulers, and the role of royal patronage for 
					Muslim scholars and artists, to the growing influence of 
					European courts as role models from the eighteenth century 
					onwards. Discussing specific terminologies for courts in 
					Oriental languages and explaining them to the 
					non-specialist, chapters describe the specific features of 
					Muslim courts and point towards future research areas. As 
					such, it fills this important gap in the existing literature 
					in the areas of Islamic history, religion, and Islam in 
					general.

      <span>
       by Suha Taji-Farouki
      </span>
      (Anqa Publishers) Investigating sufi-inspired spirituality in the modern world, this 
		interdisciplinary volume focuses on Beshara, a spiritual movement that 
		originated in Britain in the 1970s.
      <br/>
      Beshara's main inspiration is the Andalusian mystic Muhyi al-Din Ibn 
		'Arabi (d.1240), possibly the most influential thinker of the second 
		half of Islamic history. Ibn Arabi's teaching was brought to Britain by 
		Bulent Rauf (d. 1987), a descendant of the Ottoman elite, and discovered 
		there by counterculture youth searching for new spiritual ways. Beshara 
		is their joint legacy.
      <br/>
      The first detailed analysis of the adoption and adaptation of Ibn 
		Arabi's heritage by non-Muslims in the West, Beshara and Ibn 'Arabi is a 
		study of the movement's history, teachings and practices. It explores 
		the interface between sufism and the New Age, and the broader 
		contemporary encounter between Islam and the West. Investigating from a 
		global perspective the impact of cultural transformations associated 
		with modernisation and globalization on religion, this timely volume 
		concludes by tracing possible futures of sufi spirituality both in the 
		West and in the Muslim world.
      <br/>
      This book is essential reading for anyone interested in religious 
		studies and the sociology of religion, Islamic studies and Sufism, and 
		issues of cultural and spiritual dialogue between West and East.

      (Brill's Inner Asian Library: Brill Academic) Alexander's alleged Wall against Gog and Magog, often

						was a widespread theme among Syriac Christians in 
						Mesopotamia. In the ninth century Sallam the Interpreter 
						dictated an account of his search for the barrier to the

      ] Muslims have always used verses from the Qur'an to 
					support opinions on law, theology, or life in general, but 
					almost no attention has been paid to how the Qur'an presents 
					its own precepts as conclusions proceeding from reasoned 
					arguments. Whether it is a question of God's powers of 
					creation, the rationale for his acts, or how people are to 
					think clearly about their lives and fates, Muslims have so 
					internalized Qur'anic patterns of reasoning that many affirm 
					that the Qur'an appeals first of all to the human powers of 
					intellect.
      <br/>
      This book provides a new key to both the Qur'an and 
					Islamic intellectual history. Examining Qur'anic argument by 
					form and not content helps readers to discover the 
					significance of passages often ignored by the scholar who compares texts and the believer who 
					focuses upon commandments, as it allows scholars of Qur'anic 
					exegesis, Islamic theology, philosophy, and law to tie their 
					findings in yet another way to the text that Muslims 
					consider the speech of God.

       The Cambridge Companion to Muhammad
      </a>
      edited by Jonathan E. Brockopp (Cambridge 
						Companions to Religion: Cambridge University Press) As 
						the Messenger of God, Muhammad stands at the heart of 
						the Islamic religion, revered by Muslims throughout the 
						world. The Cambridge Companion to Muhammad comprises a 
						collection of essays by some of the most accomplished 
						scholars in the field exploring the life and legacy of 
						the Prophet. The book is divided into three sections, 
						the first charting his biography and the milieu into 
						which he was born, the revelation of the Qur'ān, and his 
						role within the early Muslim community. The second part 
						assesses his legacy as a law-maker, philosopher, and 
						politician and, finally, in the third part, chapters 
						examine how Muhammad has been remembered across history 
						in biography, prose, poetry, and, most recently, in film 
						and fiction. Essays are written to engage and inform 
						students, teachers, and readers coming to the subject 
						for the first time. They will come away with a deeper 
						appreciation of the breadth of the Islamic tradition, of 
						the centrality of the role of the Prophet in that 
						tradition, and, indeed, of what it means to be a Muslim 
						today.

						The king of Morocco, the director general of the

						Cassius Clay became a Muslim, he was given the name

						that does not have a brother, grandfather, or uncle 
						named Muhammad, they almost certainly have a relative 
						who has been given one of the Prophet's other names: 
						Mustafa', Ahmad, or al-Amin. One also finds the names Muhammadi ("Muhammad like") and Muhammadayn ("double 
						Muhammad"). These habits of naming are indicative of a 
						popular devotion to the Prophet that enhances, and in 
						some cases overwhelms, the historical limits of the man 
						who died more than fourteen centuries ago.

       Pathways to an Inner Islam: Massignon, Corbin, Guénon, and 
					Schuon
      </a>
      by
					Patrick Laude (State University of New York Press) 	provides an introduction to the esoteric or spiritual "inner 
					Islam" presented by Western thinkers Louis Massignon, Henry 
					Corbin, René Guénon, and Frithjof Schuon. Particularly 
					interested in Sufism--the mystical tradition of Islam--these 
					four twentieth-century authors who wrote in French played an 
					important role in presenting Islamic spirituality to the 
					West and have also had an influence in parts of the Muslim 
					world, such as Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. Patrick Laude 
					brings them together to argue that an understanding of their 
					inner Islam challenges reductionist views of Islam as an 
					essentially legalistic tradition and highlights its 
					spiritual qualities. The book discusses their thought on the 
					definitions of spiritual Islam and Sufism, the metaphysical 
					and mystical understanding of the Prophet and the Qur&lt;aµn, 
					the function of femininity in Islamic spirituality, and the 
					inner understanding of
      <i>
       jihaµd
      </i>
      . In addition, the 
					writers' Christian backgrounds and their participation in 
					the intellectual and spiritual traditions of both 
					Christianity and Islam offer a dynamic perspective on 
					interfaith dialogue.

       The Ottoman assault upon

       The Unreadable Shores of Love: Turkish Modernity and Mystic Romance
      </a>
      .
      <br/>
      The Age of Beloveds offers a rich introduction to early-modern 
			Ottoman culture through a study of its beautiful lyric love poetry. 
			At the same time, it suggests provocative cross-cultural parallels 
			in the sociology and spirituality of love in Europe—from Istanbul to 
			London—during the long sixteenth century. Walter G. Andrews and 
			Mehmet Kalpakli provide a generous sampling of translations of 
			Ottoman poems, many of which have never appeared in English, along 
			with informative and inspired close readings. The authors explain 
			that the flourishing of Ottoman power and culture during the 
			"Turkish Renaissance" manifested itself, to some degree, as an "age 
			of beloveds," in which young men became the focal points for the 
			desire and attention of powerful officeholders and artists as well 
			as the inspiration for a rich literature of love.
      <br/>
      The authors show that the "age of beloveds" was not just an Ottoman, 
			eastern European, or Islamic phenomenon. It extended into western 
			Europe as well, pervading the cultures of Venice, Florence, Rome, 
			and London during the same period. Andrews and Kalpakli contend that 
			in an age dominated by absolute rulers and troubled by war, cultural 
			change, and religious upheaval, the attachments of dependent 
			courtiers and the longings of anxious commoners aroused an intense 
			interest in love and the beloved. The Age of Beloveds reveals new 
			commonalities in the cultural-history of two worlds long seen as 
			radically different.

       Ibn Arabi

      by William Chittick (Makers of the Muslim World: 
			Oneworld Publications) Bulent Rauf, the inspiration behind the 
			British esoteric school Beshara, was often quoted as saying  
			Muhyi ad-Din Ibn Arabi is not so much a person as a meaning.  
			William Chittick who is easily the foremost interpreter of the 
			greatest Sheik in America, and who has written two massive studies 
			of ibn Arabi, seems to come into agreement with Bulent.  Muhyi 
			ad-Din Ibn Arabi is an encyclopedic writer, whose contribution to 
			the mystical meaning of Islam and the Qur'an is as central to Islam 
			as the theology of Thomas Aquinas is foundational for Western 
			Catholicism.  However unlike Thomas Aquinas, Muhyi ad-Din Ibn 
			Arabi has never known such entrenched institutional support.  
			In fact, about a century after his death, the central tenets of his 
			writings were subtly and effectively vilified and misrepresented by 
			Ibn Taymiyya,  the spiritual godfather of all literalistic and 
			fundamentalist, authoritarian and even terrorist forms of Islam.

      Despite being one of the most commented upon texts in 
			Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, the
      <em>
       Abhisamayālamkāra
      </em>
      has been 
			somewhat neglected by Western scholars, who have tended to show 
			greater interest in more ontologically and epistemologically 
			oriented texts. While this is perhaps not surprising, given the 
			fundamentally secular nature of modern Western philosophy, the lack 
			of attention is unjustified for at least two reasons. The first is 
			the argument that the concept of
      <em>
       mārga
      </em>
      incorporates and 
			presupposes everything else in Buddhism (as presented in Robert E. 
			Buswell Jr. and Robert M. Gimello's edited collection
      <em>
       Paths to 
			Liberation: The Mārga and Its Transformations in Buddhist Thought
      </em>
      [1992]), the  implication of which is that the soteriological 
			dimensions of Buddhism are just as worthy of study as its 
			philosophical aspects (if not more worthy). The second is the fact 
			that the
      <em>
       Abhisamayālamkāra
      </em>
      represents Mahāyāna Buddhism's 
			most comprehensive and influential systematization of the path, a 
			point noted in 1929 by Theodor Stcherbatsky in his introduction to 
			the first printed Sanskrit edition of the text when he described it 
			as "the fundamental work for the study of the Buddhist doctrine of 
			the Path."
      <br/>
      Recently, this imbalance within Buddhist studies has begun to 
			change. Several important commentaries on the
      <em>
       Abhisamayālamkāra
      </em>
      have been published, and scholars working in the field known to 
			Tibetans as
      <em>
       phar phyin
      </em>
      (Skt.
      <em>
       [Prajñā]pāramitā
      </em>
      ) 
			need no longer be referred to as pioneers, despite still being 
			relatively few in number. One such scholar is Karl Brunnhölzl, whose 
			recently published encyclopedic resource book on the Kagyü
      <em>
       Abhisamayālamkāra
      </em>
      commentary tradition stands as a landmark 
			contribution to Prajñāpāramitā studies. In terms of the scope of its 
			subject matter and the detail of its annotations, it is fair to say 
			that
      <em>

      (Tsadra Foundation: Snow Lion)The 
			Buddha from Dölpo is a revised and enlarged edition of the 
			only book about the most controversial Buddhist master in the 
			history of Tibet, Dölpopa Sherab Gyalt-sen (1292-1361), who became 
			perhaps the greatest Tibetan expert of the Kalacakra, or Wheel of 
			Time, a vast system of tantric teachings. Based largely on esoteric 
			Buddhist knowledge from the legendary land of Shambhala, Dölpopa's 
			insights have profoundly influenced the development of Tibetan 
			Buddhism for more than 650 years.
      <br/>
      Dölpopa emphasized two contrasting definitions of the Buddhist 
			theory of emptiness. He described relative phenomena as "empty of 
			self-nature," but absolute reality as only "empty of other,'' i.e., 
			relative phenomena. He further identified absolute reality as the buddha nature, or eternal essence, present in all living beings. 
			This view of an "emptiness of other," known in Tibetan as shentong, 
			is Dölpopa's enduring legacy.
      <br/>
      The Buddha from Dölpo contains the only English translations of 
			three of Dölpopa's crucial works. A General Commentary on the 
			Doctrine is one of the earliest texts in which he systematically 
			presented his view of the entire Buddhist path to enlightenment. The 
			Fourth Council and its Autocommentary (which was not in the first 
			edition of this book) were written at the end of his life and 
			represent a final summation of his teachings. These translations 
			are preceded by a detailed discussion of Dölpopa's life, his 
			revolutionary ideas, earlier precedents for the shentong view, his 
			unique use of language, and the influence of his theories. The fate 
			of his Jonang tradition, which was censored by the central Tibetan 
			government in the seventeenth century but still survives is also 
			examined.

       by John Whalen-Bridge and Gary Storhoff 
			(SUNY Series in Buddhism and American Culture: State University of

			explore how Asian influences have been adapted to American desires 
			in literary works and at Buddhist poetics, or how Buddhist practices 
			emerge in literary works. Starting with early aesthetic theories of 
			Ernest Fenollosa, made famous but also distorted by Ezra Pound, the 
			book moves on to the countercultural voices associated with the Beat 
			movement and its friends and heirs such as Ginsberg, Kerouac, 
			Snyder, Giorno, Waldman, and Whalen. The volume also considers the 
			work of contemporary American writers of color influenced by 
			Buddhism, such as Maxine Hong Kingston, Charles Johnson, and Lan 
			Cao. An interview with Kingston is included.

         Buddhist 
			Scriptures as Literature: Sacred Rhetoric and the Uses of Theory

			(SUNY: State University of New Your Press)
        <i>
         Buddhist 
			Scriptures as Literature
        </i>
        explores the drama, lyricism, and 
			compelling storylines in Buddhist sacred writings, while 
			illustrating how rhetoric and ideology are at work in shaping 
			readers' reactions. Ralph Flores argues that the Buddha's life story 
			itself follows an archetypal quest-romance pattern: regal 
			surroundings are abandoned and the ensuing feats are heroic. The 
			story can be read as an epic, but it also has a comic plot: 
			confusions and trials until the Prince becomes utterly selfless, 
			having found his true element--nirvana. Making use of contemporary 
			literary theory, Flores offers new readings of texts such as the
        <i>
         Nikayas
        </i>
        , the
        <i>
         Dhammapada
        </i>
        , the
        <i>

			koans, Shantideva's

        , and the
        <i>
         Tibetan Book of the Dead
        </i>
        . Understanding these works as 
			literature deepens our sense of the unfolding of their teachings, of 
			their exuberant histories, and of their relevance for contemporary 
			life.

       byThuken 
			Chökyi Nyima (1737–1802) Translated by Geshe Lhundub Sopa et al. 
			Edited by Roger Jackson  (Wisdom)  The 
			Crystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems (Grub mtha’ shel gyi me 
			long), by Thuken Losang Chökyi Nyima (1737–1802) is probably the 
			widest-ranging account of religious philosophies ever written in 
			premodern Tibet. Thuken was a cosmopolitan Buddhist monk from Amdo, 
			Mongol by heritage, Tibetan in education, and equally comfortable in 
			a central Tibetan monastery or at the imperial court in Beijing. 
			Like most texts on philosophical systems, his Crystal Mirror covers 
			the major schools of India, both non-Buddhist and Buddhist, but then 
			goes on to discuss in detail the entire range of Tibetan traditions 
			as well, with separate chapters on the Nyingma, Kadam, Kagyü, Shijé, 
			Sakya, Jonang, Geluk, and Bön. Not resting there, Thuken goes on to 
			describe the major traditions of China—Confucian, Daoist, and 
			Buddhist—as well as those of Mongolia, Khotan, and Shambhala. The 
			Crystal Mirror is unusual, too, in its concern not just to describe 
			and analyze doctrines, but to trace the historical development of 
			the various traditions. In evaluating philosophical systems, Thuken 
			does favor his own Geluk school, but he treats the views of other 
			traditions with considerable sympathy and respect as well—sometimes 
			even defending them against criticisms from his own tradition. All 
			this makes the Crystal Mirror an eloquent, erudite, and informative 
			textbook on the religious history and philosophical systems of an 
			array of Asian cultures—and provides evidence that serious and 
			sympathetic study of the history of religions has not been a 
			monopoly of Western scholarship.

       by Buddha and Glenn Wallis (Modern 
			Library Classics: Modern Library) In Basic Teachings of the Buddha, 
			Glenn Wallis selects sixteen essential dialogues drawn from more 
			than five thousand Pali-dialect suttas of the Buddhist canon. The 
			result is a vibrant introductory guide to studying Buddhist thought, 
			applying its principles to everyday life, and gaining a deeper 
			understanding of Buddhist themes in modern literature. Focusing on 
			the most crucial topics for today’s readers, Wallis presents 
			writings that address modern psychological, religious, ethical, and 
			philosophical concerns. This practical, inspiring, and engaging 
			volume provides an overview of the history of Buddhism and an 
			illuminating analysis of the core writings that personalizes the 
			suttas for each reader.
      </p>
      This little book manages to introduce the general sweep of 
			Buddhisms, while focusing upon a select number of suttas that typify 
			for us the most germane aspects of Buddha’s basic teaching. Wallis 
			also provides guidance in how to read critically these 
			archaic-in-style dialogues. Useful and well-focused introductory 
			study belongs on a short list for supplementary texts to religions 
			of the world.

        The Qur'an and Its Biblical Subtext
       </a>
       by 
					Gabriel Said Reynolds (Routledge Studies in the 
					Qur'an: Routledge) This book challenges the dominant scholarly notion that 
					the Qur'an must be interpreted through the medieval 
					commentaries shaped by the biography of the prophet 
					Muhammad, proposing instead that the text is best read in 
					light of Christian and Jewish scripture. The Qur'an, in its 
					use of allusions, depends on the Biblical knowledge of its 
					audience. However, medieval Muslim commentators, working in 
					a context of religious rivalry, developed stories that 
					separate Qur'an and Bible, which this book brings back 
					together.
       <br/>
       In a series of studies involving the devil, Adam, 
					Abraham, Jonah, Mary, and Muhammad among others, Reynolds 
					shows how modern translators of the Qur'an have followed 
					medieval Muslim commentary and demonstrates how an 
					appreciation of the Qur'an's Biblical subtext uncovers the 
					richness of the Qur'an's discourse. Presenting unique 
					interpretations of thirteen different sections of the Qur'an 
					based on studies of earlier Jewish and Christian literature, 
					the author substantially re-evaluates Muslim exegetical 
					literature. Thus The Qur'an and Its Biblical Subtext, a work 
					based on a profound regard for the Qur'an's literary 
					structure and rhetorical strategy, poses a substantial 
					challenge to the standard scholarship of Qur'anic Studies. 
					With an approach that bridges early Christian history and 
					Islamic origins, the book will appeal not only to students 
					of the Qur'an but to students of the Bible, religious 
					studies, and Islamic history.

        Essays on John and Hebrews
       </a>
       by Harold W. 
							Attridge (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen 
							Zum Neuen Testament: Mohr Siebeck) Harold W. Attridge has engaged in the interpretation of two of the most 
		intriguing literary products of early Christianity, the Gospel according 
		to John and the Epistle to the Hebrews. His essays explore the literary 
		and cultural traditions at work in the text and its imaginative rhetoric 
		aiming to deepen faith in Christ by giving new meaning to his death and 
		exaltation. His essays on John focus on the literary artistry of the 
		final version of the gospel, its playful approach to literary genres, 
		its engaging rhetoric, its delight in visual imagery. He situates that 
		literary analysis of both works within the context of the history of 
		religion and culture in the first century, with careful attention to 
		both Jewish and Greco-Roman worlds. Several essays, focusing on the 
		phenomena connected with "Gnosticism", extend that reiligio-historical 
		horizon into to the life of the early Church and contribute to the 
		understanding of the reception of these two early Christian 
		masterpieces.

        The Mystical Texts: Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice and Related Manuscripts
       </a>
       by Philip S. Alexander(Library of Second Temple Studies: 
			T&amp;T Clark) This essay provides an overview of a position I have worked out 
			at greater length in The Mystical Texts: Songs of the Sabbath 
			Sacrifice and Related Manuscripts (Companion to the Qumran Scrolls 
			7; London: T&amp;T Clark International, 2005), to which the reader is 
			referred for detailed documentation. The present article, however, 
			is not just a summary of the book. The necessity of compressing and 
			simplifying the case has led me, to some extent, to rethink and 
			clarify my argument. A number of points (e.g., the anthropology 
			behind Qumran mysticism, and the doctrine of predestination, which 
			seems to be all over the relevant texts) now strike me as more 
			important than I realised when I wrote the book. My purpose is to 
			open a debate on what happens if we take certain Scrolls seriously 
			as mysticism, and read them into the western mystical tradition.

       Deliver Us from Evil: Interpreting the Redemption from the Power of Satan in New 
Testament Theology (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament 216)
      </a>
      by Richard H. Bell (Mohr Siebeck)
     </p>
     <p>
      Richard H. Bell develops a theory of myth which does justice not 
			only to the world of 'narrative' but also to the mysteries of the 
			'physical world'. He does this by building on the phenomenal 
			distinction as introduced by Kant and further developed by 
			Schopenhauer. He then applies the resulting theory of myth to two 
			seemingly disparate examples of redemption from Satan found in the 
			New Testament: first, the exorcisms of Jesus; secondly, the 
			redemption of the human being from the power of Satan through the 
			cross and resurrection of Christ as found in the Pauline tradition 
			and in the letter to the Hebrews. Then the author makes an attempt 
			to relate these two forms of redemption to each other and to draw 
			some conclusions as to how these myths of deliverance from Satan can 
			be considered true. This can lead not only to an enrichment of New 
			Testament Theology but also to a greater understanding of the world 
			in which we live.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fundamental question addressed in this book is how the 
			redemption of the human being from Satan in New Testament theology 
			is to be interpreted. I now wish to make a number of concluding 
			comments, first of a "theological and scientific" nature and then of 
			a "pastoral" nature.

       Archetypal Cosmos: Rediscovering the Gods in Myth, Science, and 
			Astrology
      </a>
      by Keiron Le Grice (Floris Books) The modern world is passing through a period of critical change 
			on many levels: cultural, political, ecological and spiritual. We 
			are witnessing the decline and dissolution of the old order, the 
			tumult and uncertainty of a new birth. Against this background, 
			Keiron Le Grice argues that the developing insights of a new 
			cosmology could provide a coherent framework of meaning to lead us 
			beyond the growing fragmentation of culture, belief and personal 
			identity.
      <br/>
      In a compelling synthesis of the ideas of seminal thinkers from 
			depth psychology and new paradigm science, Le Grice positions the 
			new discipline of archetypal astrology at the centre of an emerging 
			world view that reunifies psyche and cosmos, spirituality and 
			science, mythology and metaphysics, enabling us to see mythic gods, 
			heroes and themes in a fresh light.
      <br/>
      Heralding a 'rediscovery of the gods' and the passage into a new 
			spiritual era, The Archetypal Cosmos presents a new understanding of 
			the role of myth and archetypal principles in our lives, one that 
			could give a cosmic perspective and deeper meaning to our personal 
			experience.

       The Fallen Sky
      </a>
      by Christopher Cokinos (Tarcher) In this 
			acclaimed volume, prizewinning poet and nature writer Christopher 
			Cokinos takes us on an epic journey from Antarctica to outer space, 
			weaving together natural history, memoir, and in-depth profiles of 
			amateur researchers, rogue scientists, and stargazing dreamers to 
			tell the riveting tale of how the study of meteorites became a 
			modern science. In 1894, fifteen years before his storied expedition 
			to the North Pole, Robert Peary crossed a treacherous expanse of ice 
			in Greenland in search of another prize: a massive meteorite laden 
			with rare metals from outer space. In this hefty, industrious book, 
			Cokinos retraces Peary’s steps, and those of other meteor “obsessives,” 
			in an idiosyncratic hunt of his own. The book pairs, sometimes 
			awkwardly, exciting tales of scientific adventure and 
			unself-conscious rumination—particularly on the subject of the 
			author’s failed first marriage, the pain of which, he insists, is 
			“part and parcel of the hunt, my hunt, for the meteorite hunters.” 
			As often as not, though, the original meteorite hunters had a more 
			prosaic view of their quests. Peary, for instance, had a simple 
			desire for glory and riches; when he finally found that meteorite, 
			which the local Inuits had dubbed Woman (another, nearby, they 
			called Dog), he called it “the brown mass.”

			providing a basis for many spiritual doctrines (including religions) 
			and psychological practices. These directions of human knowledge are 
			usually considered to contradict the laws of science. However, 
			quantum mechanics — in a sense, the mysterious direction of science 
			— allows us to include the phenomena of consciousness and life as 
			well as the relevant phenomena in the sphere of science.
        <br/>
        Wolfgang Pauli, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, 
			together with great psychologist Carl GustavJung, guessed about the 
			relation between quantum mechanics and consciousness in the 
			beginning of the twentieth century. However, only "many-worlds" 
			interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed in 1957 by Hugh 
			Everett Ill, gave the real basis for the systematic investigation of 
			this relation.
        <br/>
        Roger Penrose, one of the apologists of the relation between 
			quantum mechanics and consciousness, claimed in his Last book "The 
			Road to Reality" that the Everett's interpretation may be estimated 
			only after creating the theory of consciousness. There against, the 
			author has proposed in 2000 and further elaborates in this book, the 
			so-called Extended Everett's Concept, that allows one to derive the 
			main features of consciousness and super-consciousness (intuition, or direct vision of truth) from quantum mechanics. This is exposed in this book in a form intelligible for a wide audience.

         New Directions in Linear Acoustics and Vibration: Quantum Chaos, 
			Random Matrix Theory and Complexity
        </a>
        by Matthew Wright and 
			Richard Weaver (Cambridge University Press) The field of acoustics is of immense industrial and scientific 
			importance. The subject is built on the foundations of linear 
			acoustics, which is widely regarded as so mature that it is fully 
			encapsulated in the physics texts of the 1950s. This view was 
			changed by developments in physics such as the study of quantum 
			chaos. Developments in physics throughout the last four decades, 
			often equally applicable to both quantum and linear acoustic 
			problems but overwhelmingly more often expressed in the language of 
			the former, have explored this. There is a significant new amount of 
			theory that can be used to address problems in linear acoustics and 
			vibration, but only a small amount of reported work does so. This 
			book is an attempt to bridge the gap between theoreticians and 
			practitioners, as well as the gap between quantum and acoustic. 
			Tutorial chapters provide introductions to each of the major aspects 
			of the physical theory and are written using the appropriate 
			terminology of the acoustical community. The book will act as a 
			quick-start guide to the new methods while providing a wide-ranging 
			introduction to the physical concepts.

         Quantum Invariants of Knots and 3-Manifolds
        </a>
        by Vladimir G. Turaev (De Gruyter Studies in Mathematics: De Gruyter) Due to the strong appeal and wide use of this monograph, it is 
			now available in its second revised edition. The monograph gives a 
			systematic treatment of 3-dimensional topological quantum field 
			theories (TQFTs) based on the work of the author with N. Reshetikhin and 
O. Viro. This subject was inspired by the 
			discovery of the Jones polynomial of knots and the 
			Witten-Chern-Simons field theory. On the algebraic side, the study 
			of 3-dimensional TQFTs has been influenced by the theory of braided 
			categories and the theory of quantum groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        The book is divided into three parts. Part I presents a 
			construction of 3-dimensional TQFTs and 2-dimensional modular 
			functors from so-called modular categories. This gives a vast class 
			of knot invariants and 3-manifold invariants as well as a class of 
			linear representations of the mapping class groups of surfaces. In 
			Part II the technique of 6j-symbols is used to define state sum 
			invariants of 3-manifolds. Their relation to the TQFTs constructed 
			in Part I is established via the theory of shadows. Part III 
			provides constructions of modular categories, based on quantum 
			groups and skein modules of tangles in the 3-space.
       </p>
       <p>
        This fundamental contribution to topological quantum field theory 
			is accessible to graduate students in mathematics and physics with 
			knowledge of basic algebra and topology. It is an indispensable 
			source for everyone who wishes to enter the forefront of this 
			fascinating area at the borderline of mathematics and physics.

         <strong>
          Electricity generation is a concentrated industry with a few 
			sources of emissions, which can be controlled or legislated against. 
			This book explains that a green sustainable electricity system is 
			one whose construction, installation, and operation minimally affect 
			the environment and produce power reliability at an affordable 
			price. It addresses the question of how to build such an electricity 
			supply system to meet the demands of a growing population without

         <strong>
          The green argument for conservation and renewable energies is a 
			contradiction in terms. Although they produce no emissions, because 
			renewable systems are composed of a large number of small units, a 
			considerable amount of energy is required to produce, erect, and 
			maintain them. This book is a response to that conundrum, answering 
			key questions, such as:

        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>

				energy input?
          </strong>
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Should coal be used for clean fuel and chemical production 
				rather than for power generation?

         </li>

          <strong>
           How quickly can we start to build the Green Energy system?

			discusses the dire, immediate need for large quantities of clean,

         The Functional 
			Assessment of Wetland Ecosystems: Towards Evaluation of Ecosystem 
			Services
        </a>
        , includes CD edited by Edward Maltby, U Digby, C 
			Baker (CRC Press)  Wetlands perform functions that deliver benefits to society, 
			often referred to as ecosystem services. These ecosystem services 
			include water supply, flood regulation, water purification, climate 
			regulation, biodiversity, agriculture (e.g. grazing land), and 
			amenity. A functional approach to wetland assessment enables a 
			holistic view to be taken of the wide range of services that 
			wetlands can provide. The functional assessment procedures (FAPs) in 
			this volume translate best available scientific knowledge into 
			reasonable predictions of how component parts of wetlands function 
			in different landscape contexts. They can be used to indicate the 
			potential and priorities for management options in areas such as 
			flood control, pollution reduction and biodiversity conservation.
        <br/>
        Functional assessment enables the user to predict the functioning 
			of a wetland area without the need for comprehensive and expensive 
			empirical research. The FAPs therefore provide a methodology that 
			can be used by both experts and non-experts to assess wetland 
			functioning relatively rapidly. The volume includes an electronic 
			version of the FAPs on CD which automates aspects of the assessment 
			once the initial recording stage is completed. It is anticipated 
			that the FAPs will be used by a range of individuals or organisations concerned with wetland management who wish to gain a 
			better understanding of the processes, functions, services or 
			benefits and potential of the wetlands for which they have 
			responsibility.

        Semetsky's book is a timely antidote for our current crises 
			in education. Drawing on her empirical research with Tarot and her 
			deep knowledge of Jungian psychology, she offers an approach to 
			education that stirs the depths of the Self as it deepens mind into 
			soul. Her Tarot hermeneutic opens a path toward a revolutionary 
			pedagogy that, in its commitment to the complexity, fullness and 
			fluidity of human subjectivity, recovers the ethical and therapeutic 
			dimensions of education. A bold book, a daring achievement, a spark 
			of illumination! --ROBERT D. ROMANYSHYN, Senior Core Faculty,

        Bringing together popular and academic cultures, Inna 
			Semetsky presents Tarot as a system of transformative hermeneutics 
			for adult self-education and cultural pedagogy. Her research is a 
			decisive and intelligent step ahead from the reductive stereotype of 
			Tarot as fortune-telling. The fifteen life stories at the heart of 
			the book exemplify the author's commitment to alternative modes of 
			education and counseling that transcend individual, cultural or 
			language barriers. Assembling a rich array of sources, from 
			Hermeticism to Jungian depth psychology, the philosophies of 
			Noddings, Buber, and Deleuze, and the science of self-organization, 
			this book opens a new path to personal and social revitalization. It 
			should be widely read across disciplinary divides by scholars, 
			students, and professionals alike. --PHILIP WEXLER, Professor,

			For many communities around the world, the revitalization or at

         Manifesto of the Critical Theory of Society and Religion
        </a>
        by Rudolf Siebert (Studies in Critical Social Sciences: Brill 
			Academic)
        <o:p>
         A wonderful summa of an intensely lived social and 
			religious life. Siebert provides seminal insights derived from the 
			Social theory of the Frankfort school and grounded in neo-Kantian 
			German idealism. This is fused with the new political theology 
			grounded in a vision of human rights and universal justice as the 
			legal and ethical measure human sciences and institutions. The work, 
			though daunting at first sight, actually makes a wonderful primer 
			for students seeking a unified vision of social order that is not 
			antagonistic to the effect of transcendent in human relations.
        </o:p>
        The Manifesto develops further the Critical Theory of 
			Religion intrinsic to the Critical Theory of Society of the 
			Frankfurt School into a new paradigm of the Psychology, Sociology, 
			Philosophy and Theology of Religion. Its central theme is the 
			theodicy problem. The Manifesto approaches this theme in the 
			framework of comparative religion and critical political theology in 
			a narrative and discursive fashion. In search of a solution to the 
			theodicy problem, the Manifesto explores , trends in civil society 
			toward Alternative Future I (the Totally Administered Society), 
			Alternative Future II (the Militarized Society,), and Alternative 
			Future III (the Reconciled Society) in the horizon of the longing 
			for the Wholly Other as perfect justice and unconditional love. 
			Likewise trends in alternative futures of religion are characterizes 
			as I: Religious Fundamentalism, II: Modern and Postmodern 
			Secularism, and III: The Open Dialectic between the religious and 
			secular, toward a possible reconciliation. 
			Toward that goal it relies on both the critical theory of society as 
			developed by Max Horkheimer, Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Theodor 
			W. Adorno, and others, and on the new political theology of Johannes 
			B. Metz, Helmut Peukert, and Edmund Arens. Students and professors 
			who are interested in psychology and social psychology, sociology 
			and anthropology, philosophy and theology and comparative religion

        </a>
        by 
			Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (Mague Academy of 
			International Law: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers / Brill Academic) Professor Cançado Trindade develops his Leitmotiv of 
			identification of a corpus juris increasingly oriented to the 
			fulfillment of the needs and aspirations of human beings, of peoples 
			and of humankind as a whole. With the overcoming of the purely 
			inter-State dimension of the discipline of the past, international 
			legal personality has expanded, so as to encompass nowadays, besides 
			States and international organizations, also peoples, individuals 
			and humankind as subjects of International Law. The growing 
			consciousness of the need to pursue universally-shared values has 
			brought about a fundamental change in the outlook of International 
			Law in the last decades, drawing closer attention to its foundations 
			and, parallel to its formal sources, to its material source (the 
			universal juridical conscience). He examines the conceptual 
			constructions of this new International Law and identifies basic 
			considerations of humanity permeating its whole corpus juris, 
			disclosing the current processes of its humanization and 
			universalization. Finally, he addresses the construction of the 
			international rule of law, acknowledging the need and quest for 
			international compulsory jurisdiction, in the move towards a new jus 
			gentium, the International Law for humankind.

         The Gendered Unconscious: Can Gender Discourses Subvert Psychoanalysis?
        </a>
        by Louise Gyler 
			(Routledge) Feminist interventions in psychoanalysis have often attempted 
			either to subvert or re-frame the masculinist and phallocentric 
			biases of Freud's psychoanalysis. This book investigates the nature 
			of these interventions by comparing the status and treatment of 
			women in two different psychoanalytic models: the Kleinian and the 
			feminist models. It argues that, in fact, these interventions have 
			historically tended to reinforce such biases by collapsing the 
			distinction between the gendered minds of individuals and theories 
			of gender.
        <br/>
        This investigation is framed by two steps. First, in assessing 
			the position of women and the feminine in psychoanalysis,
        <em>
         The 
			Gendered Unconscious
        </em>
        explores not only the ways they are 
			represented in theory, but also how these representations function 
			in practice. Secondly, this book uses a framework of a comparative 
			dialogue to highlight the assumptions and values that underpin the 
			theory and clinical practice in the two psychoanalytic models. This 
			comparative critique concludes with the counter-intuitive claim that 
			contemporary Kleinian theory may, in practice, hold more radical 
			possibilities for the interests of women than the practices derived 
			from contemporary psychoanalytic gender theory.

			Goatly (Discourse Approaches to Politics, Society and Culture: John 
			Benjamins Publishing) What is meant by the notoriously vague 
			term 'ideology'? Defining this could take a whole book, so Goatly 
			provisionally adopts van Dijk's definition and description in 
			Ideol­ogy: "the basis of the social representations shared by 
			members of a group. This means that ideologies allow people, as 
			group members, to organise the multitude of social beliefs about 
			what is the case, good or bad, right or wrong, for them and to act 
			accordingly.” One major determinant of these social representations 
			will be "the material and symbolic interests of the group ... power 
			over other groups (or resistance against the domination by other 
			groups) may have a central role and hence function as a major 
			condition and purpose for the development of ideologies". This 
			emphasis on power is central to my use of the term, and, for 
			brevity's sake one might adopt Thompson's definition "meaning in the 
			service of power".

         Juvenile Delinquency: The Core
        </a>
        4th ed. by 						Larry J. Siegel, Brandon C. Welsh (Wadsworth 
						Publishing) The study of juvenile 
						delinquency is a dynamic, ever-changing field of 
						scientific inquiry in which the theories, concepts, and 
						processes are constantly evolving. We have, as such, 
						updated this text to reflect the changes that have taken 
						place in the study of delinquent behavior during the 
						past few years. This new edition includes a review of 
						recent legal cases, research studies, and policy 
						initiatives. It aims to provide a groundwork for the 
						study of juvenile delinquency by analyzing and 
						describing the nature and extent of delinquency, the 
						suspected causes of delinquent behavior, and the 
						environmental influences on youthful misbehavior. It 
						also covers what most experts believe are the critical 
						issues in juvenile delinquency and analyzes crucial 
						policy issues, including the use of pretrial detention, 
						waiver to adult court, and restorative justice programs. 
						And because we recognize that many students are career 
						oriented, we have included a new feature called 
						Professional Spotlight, which aims at giving students a 
						glimpse of what professionals are now doing to help 
						troubled youth.
        <br/>
        Commercial sexual 
						exploitation of children (CSEC) has become a global 
						social problem. CSEC involves youth (aged 17 years old 
						and younger) who engage in the performance of sexual 
						acts in return for a fee, food, drugs, shelter, 
						clothing, gifts, or other goods. The sexual conduct may 
						include any direct sexual contact, such as prostitution, 
						or live or filmed performances (e.g., stripping, 
						pornography) involving sexual acts or for the sexual 
						gratification of others. The United States Department of 
						Justice estimates that as many as 100,000 children are 
						currently involved in prostitution, child pornography, 
						and trafficking, but the true number may be in the 
						millions.

         Forensic Human Identification: An Introduction
        </a>
        edited by Tim 
			Thompson, Sue Black (CRC Press) In philosophy, "identity" is 
			whatever makes an entity definable and recognizable, in terms of 
			possessing a set of qualities or characteristics that distinguish it 
			from entities of a different type. "Identification," therefore, is 
			the act of establishing that identity. In the 17th century, John 
			Locke proposed his tabula rasa (blank slate) philosophy, which 
			concluded that the newborn child is without identity and that it is 
			entirely defined by society and circumstances after birth. While 
			this may have some basis for discussion in the worlds of 
			metaphysics, psychology, and social anthropology it has restricted 
			relevance in the worlds of disaster-victim identification, 
			biometrics, and forensic science. It is, however, true to say that, 
			although many of our parameters of biological identity may be 
			acquired after birth (tattoos, trauma, disease, dental intervention, 
			etc.), many are biologically inherent and established in the period 
			between conception and birth (DNA profile, sex, fingerprints, blood 
			group, etc.).

         The Software Interface Between Copyright and Competition Law
        </a>
        by Ashwin van Rooijen (Information Law: Wolters Kluwer, 
			Brill) The success of computer programs often depends on their 
			ability to interoperate - or communicate - with other systems. 
			Conversely, the extent to which interoperability between computer 
			programs is enabled or facilitated by the law can have a significant 
			impact on innovation and free competition in software. The two legal 
			disciplines that primarily determine the extent to which software 
			interoperability is enabled or facilitated are copyright law and 
			competition law. This important book offers the first in-depth analysis of the 
			current respective copyright and competition law approaches to 
			interoperability. With respect to copyright law, the book offers a 
			comprehensive analysis of how copyright law has been applied to 
			computer programs, how this form of protection affects 
			interoperability, and how the European Software Directive - 
			including its interpretation by courts in Member States - aims to 
			facilitate interoperability. With respect to competition law, the 
			author critically analyzes the application of Article 102 of the 
			TFEU to refusals to supply interface information, including a 
			discussion on the tension between copyright and competition law. The 
			author also examines the substantial body of U.S. case law and 
			accompanying literature on the interplay between copyright law, 
			software and interoperability. Based further on a comparison with 
			relevant ex-ante interconnection rules in European design protection 
			law and telecommunications law, the author advances several 
			recommendations aimed at facilitating interoperability in software 
			copyright law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Three interrelated approaches combine to convey an integrated and 
			immediately accessible understanding of the subject:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         - how interoperability affects innovation and free competition in 
			software;
        </li>
        <li>
         - given its effects on innovation and competition, whether 
			copyright law or competition law should primarily be concerned with 
			regulating software interoperability; and
        </li>
        <li>
         - which particular instruments are suitable to approach this 
			problem within these respective regimes.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Because of the in-depth analysis of the software interoperability 
			problem with related legal disciplines in both Europe and the United 
			States, and due to the clarity of the presentation, this will be 
			welcomed as a valuable resource by practitioners, jurists, and 
			academics concerned with copyright protection of computer software, 
			interoperability and the interaction between copyright and 
			competition law.

        2 volumes by 
			Klaus Peter Berger (Kluwer Law International: Brill) 
			consists of two books and an interactive DVD ROM. Volume I follows 
			the progress of a dispute between two companies, in step-by-step

			the dispute - including all procedural orders and awards rendered by 
			the arbitral tribunal during the arbitration, the text of legal 
			materials such as arbitration laws and rules and international

			practitioners active in the field of international dispute 
			resolution. Subtitles in the videos refer the viewer to paragraphs 
			in the books where each relevant legal problem is analysed. In 
			addition, an internet home page provides regular updates. To 
			summarise: the Case Study (Volume I) provides a realistic and highly 
			practical approach to learning and teaching the law and practice of 
			private dispute resolution in international business; the Handbook 
			(Volume II) provides a comprehensive comparative study of the law of 
			international dispute resolution; the DVD ROM allows for a highly 
			innovative, interactive teaching and learning experience, and 
			provides a comprehensive collection of arbitration rules and other 
			documentary material; and, the videos on the DVD ROM clearly 
			manifest the soft skills and advocacy skills required to 
			successfully resolve international business disputes, including the 
			unique opportunity to draw on-screen comparisons between the 
			negotiation, mediation, and arbitration methods. With its concrete 
			and highly practical approach, this innovative teaching and training 
			tool for international dispute resolution will be of immeasurable 
			value to students and teachers of dispute resolution, corporate 
			counsel, international lawyers, and business people. The DVD-ROM has 
			a large number of interactive teaching and learning features which

			The first half of the book is a historical introduction to the study

			historian whose lifelong passion was the investigation of early 
			English law and society; he dedicated himself to tackling this 
			specialized subject and was equally obsessed with explaining his 
			findings to those less informed. He was a fellow of the British

         The Creeping Codification of the New Lex 
			Mercatoria
        </a>
        , 2nd Revised Edition by Klaus Peter Berger (Kluwer 
			Law International) This greatly revised edition of an influential 
			1999 book consolidates its authoritative advocacy of the New Lex 
			Mercatoria (NLM). Since the publication of the first edition, 
			self-regulation and private governance in international business 
			have gained world-wide recognition. Three dynamic commercial law 
			initiatives in particular demonstrate that, in spite of the 
			long-lasting dispute about the nature and dogmatic underpinnings of 
			NLM, legal theory and international practice have accepted that 
			transnational business law is open to the 'codification' of its 
			contents. The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial 
			Contracts, the Principles of European Contract Law, and (most 
			recently and dramatically) the TransLex Principles all draw their 
			legal conclusions from observing the real-life phenomena surrounding 
			regional and global integration of markets and foreign direct 
			investment. This new edition presents an advanced elaboration of the 
			author's 'Creeping Codification' thesis based on the TransLex 
			Principles, an Internet-based method using an ongoing, spontaneous, 
			and dynamic codification process which is never completed. The 
			TransLex Principles contain black-letter texts of 128 principles and 
			rules of the NLM with comprehensive, constantly updated comparative 
			law references from domestic statutes, court decisions, doctrine, 
			arbitral awards, and uniform laws. An annex to this book contains a 
			synopsis of the wealth of materials available on the TransLex web 
			site as well as a rare personal account of one of the fathers"of the 
			NLM, Philippe Kahn. International legal practitioners and academics 
			alike have long complained about the inadequate legal framework for 
			international trade and commerce. This book, with its far-reaching 
			theoretical and methodological analysis of the doctrine of an 
			autonomous transnational economic law, clearly opens the way to an 
			independent and workable third legal system alongside domestic law 
			and public international law. It offers international practitioners 
			(contract negotiators, arbitrators, attorneys and other 
			representatives of the parties in international arbitration 
			proceedings) with a powerful and reliable instrument to apply 
			transnational commercial law in daily legal practice.

        As described in the preface, genetics is one sector in which there

         International Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of 
			Corporations in the Economic Order of the 21st Century
        </a>
        by Ramon Mullerat 
			(Kluwer Law International) At present, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for some may 
			not be more than an attitude. Can it be more? What degree of 
			commitment can we reasonably expect of corporations in the struggle 
			to eradicate poverty, promote human rights, halt climate change, and 
			reverse ongoing environmental destruction? It is not a question of 
			power; more than half of the world's top 100 economies are 
			corporations, not nation-states. Whatever can be done to 'fix' the 
			world's problems, corporations are in the best position to do. That 
			they should act accordingly does not seem unwarranted, and for more 
			and more corporations CSR is in fact a stated objective.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this impassioned work the well-known international lawyer 
			Ramon Mullerat suggests that one of the root problems faced by CSR 
			is one of definition. Various interested parties define the term 
			differently, and their definitions clash. However, Dr Mullerat 
			clearly shows in these pages that this very multiplicity of 
			perspectives in fact enhances our ultimate comprehension of CSR. It 
			is through an honest appreciation of the motivations and hopes 
			behind each point of view - and of the nature of their conflict - that the way forward emerges. 
			And as we examine these various perspectives, we inevitably come to 
			a clear awareness of the role of corporations in the 21st century 
			world order.

        It is finally here. Wrapped in a stunning jacket design featuring 
			the author's own photographs and embossed gold and black titling, 
			the two massive volumes of Derek Parfit's On What Matters will be 
			the most beautiful philosophy books on any shelf they grace -- a 
			worthy start to living up to over a decade of being "the most 
			eagerly awaited book in philosophy", according to Oxford University 
			Press's promotion materials. Given the enormous stature of Parfit's 
			1984 Reasons and Persons (my colleague Jake Ross calls its part IV 
			'the Platonic Form of philosophy') and Parfit's selective 
			publication schedule, it should be no surprise that his second book 
			should be so anticipated. But with Brad Hooker's [2010] advance 
			notice that it is "probably . . . the most important publication in 
			moral philosophy since Henry Sidgwick's The Methods of Ethics in 
			1874" and Peter Singer's [2011] front-page Times Literary Supplement 
			gush that it is "the most significant work in ethics since 
			Sidgwick's masterpiece was published in 1873," On What Matters 
			certainly has a lot to live up to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lofty expectations aside, there is no doubt that On What Matters 
			is an epochal work. Philosophers my age and younger have never 
			experienced a philosophical world in which there were not 
			conferences and symposia being organized for Parfit to present 
			drafts of the material collected in this work and critics to 
			evaluate it before it was even finished. It is at the same time one 
			of the most collaborative philosophical works ever created (Parfit 
			thanks hundreds for their input) and one of the most intensely 
			personal. And the book is indeed a remarkable achievement, giving us 
			a truly comprehensive picture of the moral outlook -- both normative 
			and metaethical -- of one of the greatest moral thinkers of our 
			time. Whether or not its many specific arguments are widely 
			accepted, the comprehensive picture of the normative terrain it 
			outlines is one with which future work will need to grapple.

         Plants As Persons: A Philosophical Botany
        </a>
        by Matthew Hall 
			and Harold Coward (SUNY Series on Religion and the 
			Environment: State University of New York, SUNY) Plants are people 
			too? Not exactly, but in this work of philosophical botany Matthew 
			Hall challenges readers to reconsider the moral standing of plants, 
			arguing that they are other-than-human persons. Plants constitute 
			the bulk of our visible biomass, underpin all natural ecosystems, 
			and make life on Earth possible. Yet plants are considered passive 
			and insensitive beings rightly placed outside moral consideration. 
			As the human assault on nature continues, more ethical behavior 
			toward plants is needed. Hall surveys Western, Eastern, Pagan, and 
			Indigenous thought, as well as modern science and botanical history, 
			for attitudes toward plants, noting the particular resources for 
			plant personhood and those modes of thought which most exclude 
			plants. The most hierarchical systems typically put plants at the 
			bottom, but Hall finds much to support a more positive view of 
			plants. Indeed, some Indigenous animisms actually recognize plants 
			as relational, intelligent beings who are the appropriate recipients 
			of care and respect. New scientific findings encourage this 
			perspective, revealing that plants possess many of the capacities of 
			sentience and mentality traditionally denied them.

			However, though Mou acknowledged that he derived his key concepts

			buddhological writings in the context of his larger corpus and 
			explains how and why he incorporated Buddhist ideas selectively into 
			his system. Written extremely accessibly, it provides a 
			comprehensive unpacking of Mou's ideas about Buddhism, Confucianism,

         The Ethics of Confucius and Aristotle: Mirrors of Virtue
        </a>
        by Jiyuan Yu (Routledge Studies in Ethics and Moral Theory: 
			Routledge) The emergence of virtue ethics, which might be the most 
			significant development in contemporary ethics, takes Aristotle's 
			ethics as the most important paradigm. Aristotle's ethical thinking, 
			in contrast to modern Western moral philosophy, starts with a 
			reflection on human life as a whole instead of on some moral acts, 
			and focuses on character and virtue instead of on principles and 
			rules. This way of doing ethics is shared by Confucius. First, 
			Confucius seeks to find the human dao, i.e. the way to become a good 
			person. Second, to become a good person, one must cultivate de, that 
			is, a dispositional character (indeed, de has been generally 
			translated as "virtue" in English). Confucius calls this 
			dispositional character ren. Ren has been generally translated as 
			"benevolence" or "humanity," but is also widely referred to as 
			"virtue," "complete virtue," or "cardinal virtue."

         Overcoming Our Evil: Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi 
			and Augustine
        </a>
        by Aaron Stalnaker
			(Moral Traditions: Georgetown University Press) Can people ever 
			really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how? 
			"Overcoming Our Evil" focuses on the way ethical and religious 
			commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical 
			practices that Pierre Hadot has called 'spiritual exercises'. These 
			practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a 
			significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation 
			of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and 
			historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, 
			Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by 
			examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and 
			taking religious and seemingly 'aesthetic' practices such as prayer, 
			ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More 
			specifically, "Overcoming Our Evil" examines and compares the 
			thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and 
			the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful 
			accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work 
			central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand 
			the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must 
			first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker 
			disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of 
			'human nature'. His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical 
			vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental 
			issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the 
			complex idea of 'the will', to examine how our dispositions to feel, 
			think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison 
			meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers 
			demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the 
			case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In 
			throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in 
			unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding 
			practices of personal formation, and more clearly exposes the 
			intellectual and political issues involved in the retrieval of 
			'classic' ethical sources in diverse contemporary societies, 
			illuminating a path toward a contemporary understanding of 
			difference.

        by Te-Li Lau

         Thomas Bradwardine, Insolubilia
        </a>
        edition,

			W. Rosemann (Dallas Medieval Texts and Translations 
			Series, 10: Peeters) Read's introduction,
        <a name="read">

        edition, and translation familiarize us with 
			the roots of the medieval discussion of the insolubles in 
			Aristotle's works, and with the more immediate context of 
			Bradwardine's treatment, in particular his refutation of the views 
			of contemporaries such as Walter Burley. The appendices include 
			material that post-dates Bradwardine, yet shows clear signs of its 
			dependence on the prince of the natural philosophers, as Ralph 
			Strode called him half a century later. On the other hand, Professor 
			Read's introduction brings Bradwardine's solution of the problem of 
			insolubles into direct dialogue with modern logic, represented by 
			the theories of figures such as Alfred Tarski, Saul Kripke, and 
			Frederic Fitch. What is fascinating here is that the univocity of 
			logical language, its quasi-mathematical precision, appears to 
			render such a dialogue relatively uncomplicated. In cases where 
			thinkers from different periods do not adopt such logical language, 
			it is much more difficult to offer mutual translations of their 
			systems of thought, which remain more closely tied to metaphors, 
			literary genres, and other non-philosophical factors. Philipp W. 
			Rosemann.

         The Animals Reader: The Essential Classic and Contemporary Writings
        </a>
        edited by Linda Kalof, and Amy Fitzgerald (Berg) The study of animals - and the relationship between humans and 
			other animals - is now one of the most fiercely debated topics in 
			contemporary science and culture.
        <br/>
        Animals have a long history in human society, providing food, 
			labour, sport and companionship as well as becoming objects for 
			exhibit. More contemporary uses extend to animals as therapy and in 
			scientific testing. As natural habitats continue to be destroyed, 
			the rights of animals to co-exist on the planet - and their symbolic 
			power as a connection between humans and the natural world - are 
			ever more hotly contested.
        <br/>
        The Animals Reader brings together the key classic and 
			contemporary writings from Philosophy, Ethics, Sociology, Cultural 
			Studies, Anthropology, Environmental Studies, History, Law and 
			Science. As the first book of its kind, The Animals Reader provides 
			a framework for understanding the current state of the 
			multidisciplinary field of animal studies.This anthology will be 
			invaluable for students across the Humanities and Social Sciences as 
			well as for general readers.

			Secondary to the change in demographics of women considering

			women are delaying pregnancy until they are in their 40s. Couple 
			this with an epidemic of obesity as well as rising cesarean section 
			rates (with a tremendous increase in repeat cesarean section) and 
			one can easily understand why these emergencies will continue to 
			commonly occur. Also due to an improvement in medical and surgical 
			care and advances in medical technology, many women with serious 
			preexisting medical and surgical disorders are now surviving to 
			reproductive age and are capable of pregnancy.

       <i>
        Cutting-edge volume devoted to optimal adult development.
       </i>
       Postconventional stages of personality development 
			involve growth well beyond the average, and have become a rapidly 
			growing subject of research not only in developmental psychology 
			circles but also in areas such as executive leadership development. 
			This book is the first to bring together many of the major 
			researchers in the field, showcasing diverse perspectives ranging 
			from the spiritual to the corporate. The contributors present 
			research on essential questions about the existence and prevalence 
			of high levels of personal growth, whether such achievement is 
			correlated with other types of psychological growth, whether high 
			levels of growth actually indicate happiness, what kinds of people 
			exhibit these higher levels of development, how they may have 
			developed this expanded perspective, and the characteristics of 
			their viewpoints, abilities, and preoccupations. For anyone 
			interested in Ken Wilber's integral psychology, as well as those in 
			executive coaching, this volume is an invaluable resource and will 
			be a standard reference for years to come.

        New Dangerous Liaisons: Discourses on Europe and Love in the 
			Twentieth Century
       </a>
       by Luisa Passerini, Liliana Ellena, and 
			Alexander C. T. Geppert (Making Sense of History: Berghahn) In 
			Europe, love has been given a prominent place in European 
			self-representations from the Enlightenment onwards. The category of 
			love, stemming from private and personal spheres, was given a public 
			function and used to distinguish European civilization from others. 
			Contributors to this volume trace historical links and analyze 
			specific connections between the two discourses on love and Europe 
			over the course of the twentieth century, exploring the distinctions 
			made between the public and private, the political and personal. In 
			doing so, this volume develops an innovative historiography that 
			includes such resources as autobiographies, love letters, and 
			cinematic representations and takes issue with the exclusivity of 
			Eurocentrism. Its contributors put forth hypotheses about the 
			historical pre-eminence of emotions and consider this history as a 
			basis for a non-Eurocentric understanding of new possible European 
			identities.

        Jungian Psychoanalysis: Working in the Spirit of Carl Jung
       </a>
       by Murray Stein (Open Court) Written by 40 of the most notable Jungian psychoanalysts — spanning 11 countries, and boasting decades of study and expertise — Jungian Psychoanalysis represents the pinnacle of Jungian thought. This handbook brings up to date the perspectives in the field of clinically applied analytical psychology, centering on five areas of interest: the fundamental goals of Jungian psychoanalysis, the methods of treatment used in pursuit of these goals, reflections on the analytic process, the training of future analysts, and special issues, such as working with trauma victims, handicapped patients, or children and adolescents, and emergent religious and spiritual issues. Discussing not only the history of Jungian analysis but its present and future applications, this book marks a major contribution to the worldwide study of psychoanalysis.

       </a>
       by John R. Peteet, Francis G. Lu, and 
			William E. Narrow (American Psychiatric Publishing) The relationship between spirituality 
			and mental health 
			has been the focus of growing interest and research over the last decade. However, the implications for psychiatric classification are only beginning to be systematically explored. Religious and Spiritual Issues in Psychiatric Diagnosis: A Research Agenda for DSM-V gathers for the first time the collective contributions of the prominent clinicians and researchers who participated in the 2006 Corresponding Committee on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry of the American Psychiatric Association. The symposium was an attempt to expand the current DSM text on "Specific Culture, Age, and Gender Features" and "Differential Diagnosis" to include the impact of religious/spiritual factors on phenomenology, differential diagnosis, course, outcome, and prognosis. The philosophical issues at stake in the differential diagnosis of spiritual versus psychiatric conditions are explored at length, as is the case for updating the V Code for a Spiritual or Religious Problem. Two expert commentaries follow each chapter and seek to contextualize and extend the research, analysis, and recommendations presented. Mental health clinicians who seek to practice in a more holistic, integrative manner will find in this 
			unique and important volume the theoretical and practical foundations to support and further their work.

        On Behalf of the Mystical Fool: Jung on the Religious Situation
       </a>
       by John P. Dourley
			(Routledge) Jung's explanation of the religious tendency of the psyche 
			addresses many sides of the contemporary debate on religion and the 
			role that it has in individual and social life. This book discusses 
			the emergence of a new mythic consciousness and details ways in 
			which this consciousness supersedes traditional concepts of religion 
			to provide a spirituality of more universal inclusion.
       <br/>
       On Behalf of the Mystical Fool examines Jung's critique of 
			traditional western religion, demonstrating the 
			negative consequences of religious and political collective 
			unconsciousness, and their consequent social irresponsibility in 
			today's culture. The book concludes by suggesting that a new 
			religiosity and spirituality is currently emerging in the West based 
			on the individual’s access to the sense of ultimacy residual in the 
			psyche, and seeking expression in a myth of a much wider compass.
      </p>

       This book will be of interest to scholars and students at all 
			levels who are engaged in the expanding field of Jungian studies. It 
			will also be key reading for anyone interested in the theoretical 
			and therapeutic connections between the psyche and religious 
			experience.

       (Peter Lang Publishing) stands in the

			makes clear how far this view on the rationality of the emotions can 
			be generalized: whether it can, for instance, be generalized to 
			computers having rational emotions and whether emotional responses

       , John R. Peteet (American 
			Psychiatric Association) Unlike works that focus primarily on 
			spiritual experience, this clearly written volume focuses on 
			worldview - the cognitive aspects of belief - and how it affects the 
			behavior of both patient and clinician. Also unlike other works, 
			this remarkable volume summarizes assessment, formulation, and 
			treatment principles, using powerful case vignettes to illustrate 
			how these principles can be applied to any individual of any faith 
			or "non-faith," including practical clinical information on major 
			faith traditions and on the secular (i.e., atheist/agnostic) 
			worldview. This refreshing text sheds much-needed light on an area 
			too often obscure to many clinicians. Because it bridges several 
			disciplines in a novel way, this thought-provoking volume will find 
			a diverse audience among mental health care students, educators, and 
			professionals everywhere concerned with religious and spiritual 
			aspects of their patients' lives.

        Gods of the Word: Archetypes in the Consonants

			initial consonants of a word had a set of meanings, and the 
			remaining rhyming part also had a set of meanings. One 'sense' of 'str-' 
			is linearity: string, strip, stripe, street, etc. And one sense of 
			'-ap' is flat: cap, flap, lap, map, etc. If you put them together, 
			you get a flat line: 'strap'. The idea fascinated me, and since I 
			was marking all these words anyway, I decided to keep an eye out for 
			these classes which have similar meaning and pronunciation both. It

        by Andreas Mehl, translated by Hans-Friedrich Mueller 
			(Blackwell Introductions to the Classical World: Wiley-Blackwell)
			Roman Historiography: An Introduction to its Basic Aspects and 
			Development presents a comprehensive introduction to the development 
			of Roman historical writings in the ancient world. Andreas Mehl 
			traces the arc of ancient historical writing about Rome from its 
			origins with the authors of clan history and fragmentary annalists 
			to the writings of Byzantine scholar Procopius, the last major 
			historian of the ancient world.
			Rooting his survey in the context of its Greek predecessors, and 
			within the broader framework of Roman literature and society, Mehl 
			discusses every historical writer of significance in the ancient 
			Roman era and provides much more than simple biographical detail. 
			Also considered are essential themes such as genre, teleology, the 
			idea of Rome, and exemplary moral conduct. By paying scrupulous 
			attention to political context and religious developments throughout 
			the ancient world, Mehl reveals the evolution and interpenetration 
			of both pagan and Christian historiography.

       </a>
       [Hardcover] by Jonathan I. Israel (Oxford 
			University Press) That the Enlightenment shaped modernity is 
			uncontested. Yet remarkably few historians or philosophers have 
			attempted to trace the process of ideas from the political and

			This is precisely what Jonathan Israel now does.
       <br/>
       In

        Democratic Enlightenment
       </em>
       , Israel demonstrates that the 
			Enlightenment was an essentially revolutionary process, driven by 
			philosophical debate. The American Revolution and its concerns 
			certainly acted as a major factor in the intellectual ferment that 
			shaped the wider upheaval that followed, but the radical
       <em>
        philosophes
       </em>
       were no less critical than enthusiastic about the 
			American model. From 1789, the General Revolution's impetus came 
			from a small group of
       <em>
        philosophe-revolutionnaires
       </em>
       , men such 
			as Mirabeau, Sieyes, Condorcet, Volney, Roederer, and Brissot. Not 
			aligned to any of the social groups represented in the French 
			National assembly, they nonetheless forged "
       <em>
        la philosophie 
			moderne

       "--in effect Radical Enlightenment ideas--into a 
			world-transforming ideology that had a lasting impact in Latin 
			America, Canada and eastern Europe as well as France, Italy, 
			Germany, and the Low Countries. In addition, Israel argues that 
			while all French revolutionary journals powerfully affirmed that
       <em>
        la philosophie moderne
       </em>
       was the main cause of the French 
			Revolution, the main stream of historical thought has failed to 
			grasp what this implies. Israel sets the record straight, 
			demonstrating the true nature of the engine that drove the 
			Revolution, and the intimate links between the radical wing of the 
			Enlightenment and the anti-Robespierriste "Revolution of reason."

        New Perspectives on Late Antiquity
       </a>
       by David 
						Hernandez de la Fuente (Cambridge Scholars Publishing) 
						Perhaps it is fully justified to think of Late Antiquity 
						(3rd 7th centuries) as the first Renaissance of the 
						Classical World. This period can be considered a 
						fundamental landmark for the transmission of the 
						Classical Legacy and the transition between the ancient 
						and the medieval individual. During Late Antiquity the 
						Classical Education or enkyklios paideia of Hellenism 
						was linked definitively to the Judeo-Christian and 
						Germanic elements that have modelled the Western World. 
						The present volume combines diverse interests and 
						methodologies with a single purpose unity and diversity, 
						as a Neo-Platonic motto providing an overall picture of 
						the new means of researching Late Antiquity. This 
						collective endeavour, stemming from the 2009 1st 
						International Congress on Late Antiquity in Segovia 
						(Spain), focuses not only on the analysis of new 
						materials and latest findings, but rather puts together 
						different perspectives offering a scientific update and 
						a dialogue between several disciplines. New Perspectives 
						on Late Antiquity contains two main sections 1. Ancient 
						History and Archaeology, and 2. Philosophy and Classical 
						Studies including both overview papers and case studies. 
						Among the contributors to this volume are some of the 
						most relevant scholars in their fields, including P. 
						Brown, J. Alvar, P. Barcela, C. Cododer, F. Fronterotta, 
						D. Gigli, F. Lisi and R. Sanz.

Helene Cazes (Brill's Studies in Intellectual History: Brill Academic) One of the last Renaissance humanists, Bonaventura Vulcanius, is

			Born in Bruges in 1538, the son of a disciple of Erasmus, he spent 
			the troubled decades of the 1560s and 1570s wandering Europe 
			(Burgos, Toledo, Cologne, Frankfort, Geneva, Basel, Antwerp). In 
			1581 Vulcanius was appointed professor of Greek and Latin Letters at 
			the University of Leiden. He edited and translated many rare texts, 
			composed dictionaries, wrote laudatory poems, and compiled the first 
			chapters of a history of the Germanic languages. This volume gathers 
			recent research on this versatile philologist, and includes the 
			first editions of many unpublished works and documents.

       <br/>
       The influence of ancient Greece and Rome can be seen in

       </a>
       by Julie G. 
			Marshall (Routledge) This bibliography is a record of British relations with Tibet in 
			the period 1765 to 1947. As such it also involves British relations 
			with Russia and China, and with the Himalayan states of Ladakh, 
			Lahul and Spiti, Kumaon and Garhwal, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and 
			Assam, in so far as British policy towards these states was affected 
			by her desire to establish relations with Tibet. It also covers a 
			subject of some importance in contemporary diplomacy. It was the 
			legacy of unresolved problems concerning Tibet and its borders, 
			bequeathed to India by Britain in 1947, which led to border disputes 
			and ultimately to war between India and China in 1962. These borders 
			are still in dispute today. It also provides background information 
			to Tibet's claims to independence, an issue of current importance. 
			The work is divided into a number of sections and subsections, based 
			on chronology, geography and events. The introductions to each of 
			the sections provide a condensed and informative history of the 
			period and place the books and articles in their historical context. 
			Most entries are also annotated. This work is therefore both a

			entry into a complex area for scholars in the fields of 
			international relations and military history as well as Asian 
			history.

        War and Revolution in the Caucasus: Georgia Ablaze
       </a>
       by 
			Stephen F. Jones (ThirdWorlds: Routledge) 
						The South Caucasus has traditionally been a 
						playground of contesting empires. This region, on the 
						edge of Europe, is associated in Western minds with 
						ethnic conflict and geopolitical struggles. In August 
						2008, yet another war broke out in this distant European 
						periphery as Russia and Georgia clashed over the secessionist 
						territory of South Ossetia. The war had global 
						ramifications culminating in deepening tensions between 
						Russia on the one hand, and Europe and the USA on the 
						other. Speculation on the causes and consequences of the 
						war focused on Great Power rivalries and a new Great Game, on oil 
						pipeline routes, and Russian imperial aspirations.
       <br/>
       This book takes a different tack which focuses on the 
						domestic roots of the August 2008 war. Collectively the 
						authors in this volume present a more multidimensional 
						context for the war. They analyze historical relations 
						between national minorities in the region, look at the 
						link between democratic development, state-building, and 
						war, and explore the role of leadership and public 
						opinion. Digging beneath often simplistic geopolitical 
						explanations, the authors give the national minorities 
						and Georgians themselves, the voice that is often 
						forgotten by Western analysts.
       <br/>

        Russian-Muslim Confrontation in the Caucasus
       </a>
       by Muhammad Tahir al-Qarakhi and Lev Tolstoi, edited by 
						Thomas Sanders, Ernest Tucker and Gary Hamburg (Soas/Routledge 
						Studies on the Middle East: Routledge) This book presents two important texts, The Shining 
						of Daghestani Swords by al-Qarakhi and a new translation 
						for a contemporary readership of Lev Tolstoi's Hadji 
						Murat, illuminating the mountain war between the Muslim 
						peoples of the Caucasus and the imperial Russian army 
						from 1830 to 1859. The editors offer a complete 
						commentary on the various intellectual and religious 
						contexts that shaped the two texts and explain the 
						historical significance of the Russian—Muslim 
						confrontation. It is shown that the mountain war was a 
						clash of two cultures, two religious outlooks and two 
						different worlds. The book provides an important 
						background to the ongoing contest between Russia and 
						indigenous people for control of the Caucasus. The two 
						translations are accompanied by short introductions and 
						by a longer commentary intended for readers who desire a 
						broader introduction to the tragic conflict in the 
						Caucasus whose effects still reverberate in the 
						twenty-first century.
       <br/>
       Thus, this book presents two perspectives on the 
						Caucasus: Tolstoi's enlightened European viewpoint and 
						al-Qarakhi's indigenous interpretation. The commentary 
						at the end of this work analyzes the war of worlds 
						between imperial Russia and the Islamic mountaineers. 
						Because of the currency of the subject matter, the 
						eminence of Tolstoi, and the privileged proximity of al-Qarakhi 
						to Imam Shamil and to the imam's view of the conflict, 
						we think this book is an excellent case study of 
						cultural collision. As such we hope it will be of 
						interest to specialists in Russian and Middle Eastern 
						studies, to teachers of world and European history 
						courses, and to the educated public in the 
						English-speaking world and beyond.

			PhD students,. Randall S. Howarth, whose own work is very much 
			concerned with the same topics. The publication of these articles in 
			a single volume provides a comprehensive commentary on the 
			assumptions governing modern reconstructions of the period and the 
			problems informing those assumptions.
       <br/>
       The social and institutional history of the Roman Republic, 
			especially that of the earliest years, is one of the most 
			problematic and contested areas of study in the ancient world. 
			Modem scholars have tended to assume that we should take the broad 
			outlines of the traditions handed to us by the Romans at face value, 
			despite their invention hundreds of stories after the fact. The 
			inevitable result is that the dominant modern narrative contains a 
			core of assumptions of dubious historicity. While some scholars 
			have made significant attempts to correct portions of the obviously 
			flawed narrative, virtually none have gone so far as to question its 
			most fundamental elements. Mitchell's work has always done exactly 
			this and when originally published, the majority of his arguments were 
			regarded as radical. Nevertheless, over the last twenty years, or so, 
			scholarly consensus is inexorable moving toward Mitchell. This 
			collection traces the development of Mitchell's thought processes 
			and highlights all of the most important evidence.

			David J. Halperin (Viking)

       is set in the early part of 1963 
			and seems to have been written up around 1966. It covers of the arc 
			of high school, the crucible of adolescent angst and alienation. On 
			first reading it seems to be a slightly autobiographical coming of 
			age tale of a lonely scholarly Jewish boy, living more in the 
			Gentile world than in the comfort of a Jewish extended family. His 
			mother is chronically ill with a heart condition which may have 
			emerged during her pregnancy with Danny. He feels a profound guilty 
			responsibility for his mother's illness and at the same time finds 
			that her behavior distances him from her. Danny idealizes his 
			slightly remembered grandfather who was a religious Jew, a Rabbi. 
			His father is an unhappy man who is mostly remote except for his 
			occasional excavations of his son’s pimples with a pin. At 13 Danny 
			Schapiro is at the end of childhood and his childhood friends and at 
			the beginning of adolescence with its sexual anxiety and naivety. 
			Danny is confused about his Jewishness, he has been warned by his 
			mother that it sets him apart, especially when it comes to girls and 
			dating. It seems all adolescents share a trait of universal 
			loneliness and disaffection where they are set apart and find no 
			group to cling.

        Habibi
       </a>
       by 			
			Craig Thompson (Pantheon) Habibi is a fable of exploitation and the 
			cruelty of the strong toward the weak. It is a love story, though 
			the the kind of love it celebrates--maternal, platonic, 
			erotic--remains elusive throughout. It is also a sermon complete 
			with hell-fire and brimstone and strident pleading about the dangers 
			of the sin of waste. Most of all it is prophecy dressed in poetry's 
			clothing--an artful shriek announcing of the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story is finally an allegory of the soul as woman, and black 
				child, as sexually exploited, enslaved and environmentally raped 
				set in a mythically ensnared fable of extreme industrial 
				development and oriental despotic capital wanton waste. This 
				fable juxtaposes traditional Qur'anic folklore with its 
				modernistic isolation of a child adoptive mother and their 
				unconventional love and resolution. The introduction of magic 
				squares and calligraphic symbolism offers in the end a sustained 
				cosmological twist and depth to the tale.

        Land
       </a>
       (3 vols.) by Pak Kyung-Ni and translated with Introduction and 
			glossary by Agnita Tennant (Global Oriental: Brill) Acclaimed as the most powerful and important piece of Modern 
			Korean writing, the epic sweep of Land is breathtaking in its 
			conception and execution. Set against the background of the struggle 
			between conservative and modernizing forces at the turn of the 
			twentieth century, it follows the fortunes of several generations of 
			Korean villagers during a time of unsurpassed turbulence and change. 
			To Korean readers, upon whose imagination Land has an unparalleled 
			hold, and for whom the characters and village have a palpable 
			reality, it is the great national novel — the work that embodies—the 
			many elements that make up Korea and the Koreans of today.
       <br/>
       Beginning with the village's celebration of the Harvest Moon 
			Festival in 1897, the plot takes place over a ten-year period and 
			revolves around the household of Ch'oe Chisu, a rich landowner, who, 
			though envied by many for his wealth, is embittered by the fact that 
			his wife has not borne him a son. Characters emerge upon whom the 
			rest of the story devolves — including the Lady Yun with her 
			prophetic wisdom; the wilful Sohui, daughter of Ch'oe Chisu; and the 
			tender-hearted Wolson, accepting as her due the ignominy of life as 
			a shaman's daughter.
       <br/>
       An enthralling saga and panorama of Korean village life in the 
			early 20th century (roughly 1895-1925) by that country's most highly 
			acclaimed living novelist. The story, which possesses both the 
			formal dimensions and the high seriousness of epic, is set in a 
			period during which Japan held strong sway over Korea, regulating 
			its business and industry and making arbitrary land grants to 
			Japanese settlers. At the heart of the novel is a series of 
			conflicts between Korean conservatives too enervated to oppose 
			Japan's acquisitive energies and radical native insurgents. Their 
			resistance culminated in the Dong Hak rebellion, a watershed 
			historical event that casts long shadows over the intricately 
			interwoven fates of Kyong-Ni's vividly drawn characters--most 
			especially Choi Chisoo, an arrogant, wealthy landowner, hated and 
			envied by his neighbors and servants, and at continual odds with his 
			embittered wife, whose ``failure'' to bear him a son provokes Choi's 
			bitter displeasure and sets in motion a chain of events leading to 
			his downfall. The author employs a kind of Upstairs, Downstairs 
			structure, in which nondescript villagers and assorted second-class 
			citizens observe, comment on, and in some ways parallel the lives of 
			their "betters.'' Among the most memorable are Pyongsan, an 
			impoverished landowner waiting patiently through half a lifetime to 
			be revenged on the avaricious Choi; the handsome villager Yongi; and 
			the scheming Guinyo, the ambitious housemaid whose plan to rise 
			above her station precipitates chaos, losses, and death, and drives 
			the story to its stunning, tragic conclusion. The energy of 
			melodrama surges through this big novel, yet as a portrait of a 
			culture and a knowing psychological tale of the social and personal 
			consequences of rigidly enforced class differences, it's a work of 
			high literary distinction as well. A much-beloved work in Korea 
			(where it was made into an equally popular television series) that 
			should find many grateful admirers in America as well.

        The Survival of Myth: Innovation, Singularity and Alterity
       </a>
       Revised edition by Paul Hardwick and David Kennedy (Cambridge 
	  Scholars Publishing) What are myths and what are they for? Myths are 
	  stories that both tell us how to live and remind us the inescapability and 
	  pull of the collective past. The Survival of Myth: Innovation, Singularity 
	  and Alterity explores the continuing power of primal stories to inhabit 
	  our thinking. An international range of contributors examine a range of 
	  texts and figures from the Bible to Cormac McCarthy and from Thor to the 
	  Virgin Mary to focus on the way that ancient stories both give access to 
	  the unconscious and offer individuals and communities personae or masks. 
	  Myths translated and recreated become, in this sense, very public acts 
	  about very private thoughts and feelings. The subtitle of the book, 
	  Innovation, Singularity and Alterity, reflects the way in which the 
	  history of cultures in all genres is a history of innovation, of a search 
	  for new modes of expression which, paradoxically, often entails recourse 
	  to myth precisely because it offers narratives of singularity and 
	  otherness which may be readily appropriated. The individual contributors 
	  offer testament to the continuing significance of myth through its own 
	  constant metamorphosis, as it both reflects and transforms the societies 
	  in which it is (re)produced.

       The
       <i>
        Cahiers/Notebooks
       </i>
       of Paul Valéry are a unique 
form of writing. They reveal Valéry as one of the most radical and creative 
minds of the twentieth century, encompassing a wide range of investigation into 
all spheres of human activity. His work explores the arts, the sciences, 
philosophy, history and politics, investigating linguistic, psychological and 
social issues, all linked to the central questions, relentlessly posed: 'what is 
the human mind and how does it work?’, 'what is the potential of thought and 
what are its limits?' But we encounter here too, Valéry the writer: exploratory, 
fragmentary texts undermine the boundaries between analysis and creativity, 
between theory and practice. Neither journal nor diary, eluding the traditional 
genres of writing, the Notebooks offer lyrical passages, writing of extreme 
beauty, prose poems of extraordinary descriptive power alongside theoretical 
considerations of poetics, ironic aphorisms and the mast abstract kind of 
analysis. The concerns and the insights that occupied Valéry's inner voyages 
over more than 50 years remain as relevant as ever for the contemporary reader: 
for the Self that is his principal subject is at once singular and universal.

			at once a form of ruthlessly honest self‑examination and a process

			mastery through a highly complex system of mental training and 
			conditioning is seen in the dynamic relation between the inner self 
			and the external world. But at the same time the 
			personal/existential dimension of Valéry's analysis of the self is 
			reflected in the permanent and tragic struggle with the force of his 
			own emotions. The acuity and intensity of the experience of love is

      <p>
       Volume 2 focuses upon the cultural, literary and artistic 
			dimension of the writing, both as creative, lyrical inventiveness 
			and as reflection upon the processes involved. Here we encounter the 
			aesthetic function, as scriptural activity, perceiving eye, 
			listening ear explore this domain via an inner self‑language 
			surpassing the limits of genre or school. 'the great importance of 
			his aesthetic insights reveals Valéry's status as a forerunner of 
			the most modem artistic concepts, prefiguring critical movements and 
			approaches to creativity decades before their subsequent 
			realization. The Notebooks are seen as a field of continuous 
			literary creativity and graphic experimentation in a context of 
			untrammeled personal freedom, favoring the constitution of a very 
			little known corpus of creative writing ‑ notably the prose poems 
			and the micro‑fictions. This approach to the search for meaning is a 
			dynamic process of constant generative power, which situates the 
			Notebooks at the heart of the 20th century concept of the 'work in 
			progress' and invites comparison with such exemplary exponents as 
			Proust and Musil.

        VOLUME 3: PSYCHOLOGY ‑ SOMA AND C E M ‑ SENSIBILITY ATTENTION 
			‑MEMORY ‑ DREAM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The understanding of mind is explored in volume 3 as linked 
			indissolubly to a deepening reflection of the self's sensory and 
			emotional responses and its link to its own past through the working 
			of memory processes. Valéry's lifelong analytic fascination with 
			dreams and dreaming runs parallel to that of Surrealism, which he 
			fundamentally mistrusted, and of the development in France of 
			Freud's insights, which he knew only at second hand, and often 
			refuted violently. Yet Valéry is often closer than he thinks to the 
			psychoanalytical explorations of the unconscious pursued by Freud 
			and Lacan; and their insights in turn offer a fascinating 
			counterpoint to his reworkings as thinker and as poet of the world 
			of dream. This reflection differs greatly from the traditional view 
			of Valéry as irrevocably asserting the primacy of the mind over the 
			body and its responses; analysis of the functioning of the mind 
			includes both its conscious and unconscious reflexes ‑ dream and 
			imagination.

        VOLUME 4: LANGUAGE ‑ BIOS ‑ MATHEMATICS ‑ SCIENCE TIME ‑ HOMO ‑HISTORY‑POLITICS ‑ EDUCATION
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fully reflective of some of the most exciting scientific 
			discoveries of the twentieth century, volume 4 reveals Valéry as an 
			important scientific thinker and epistemologist, engaged not only 
			with issues of the internal mental world but with the external 
			dimension of the Body‑Mind‑World coupling. His reflections upon 
			language date from the earliest period when he sought a language 
			freed from its arbitrary association with reality and capable of 
			expressing pure analytical functions, his 'Arithmeticales 
			Universals' or algebra of the mind. The notes offer an 
			extraordinarily rich perspective on key areas of scientific 
			progress: modern mathematics, atomic and quantum physics, 
			relativity, the uncertainty principle, space‑time 
			interrelationships. But man is seen too as an organism living in an 
			often difficult relationship with his environment. The contribution 
			of the Notebooks to the wider contexts of historical and 
			socio­political problems is fundamental: not only a probing analyst 
			of political power and action, Valéry here emerges as a radical 
			educationalist and as a social scientist concerned with the 
			betterment of society, including on the international level.

        VOLUME 5: SYSTEM ‑ PHILOSOPHY ‑ CONSCIOUSNESS ‑ THETA
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Volume 5 addresses some of the most abstract issues in Valéry's 
			project to 'make his mind' while linking back to many of the 
			questions tackled in previous volumes. The 'System' is a theoretical 
			extrapolation of the intensely personal experiences of the self. His 
			attack on the intellectual patterns of traditional philosophy is 
			linguistically motivated, and the creation of a whole new 
			philosophical basis to experience is presented as a reinvigoration 
			and revision of the way language relates to the world. New material 
			included in this volume reveals a more positive approach to 
			philosophy, and links emerge with the Vienna School, as well as the 
			striking overlap with Wittgenstein. This volume demonstrates the 
			importance of the dovetailing and unifying thrust towards the 
			unknown of the self s affective, existential nature. The systematic 
			rethinking of all theological discourses inherited from the European 
			past reveals a search for a new spiritual identity and a radical 
			reconfiguration of the notion of the 'divine' as a natural and 
			necessary category of the mind. The supreme importance of a certain 
			mystical resonance in Valéry, expressed in some of his most 
			magnificent writing, complements the more scientific nature of 
			volume 4, while leading us back to volume 1 through rich echoes with 
			key themes of EROS.

       With its first edition, The Longman Anthology of British 
			Literature created a new paradigm for anthologies. Responding to 
			major shifts in literary studies over the past thirty years, it 
			became the first collection to pay detailed attention to the 
			contexts within which these classic works of British literature were 
			created and to highlight the full cultural diversity of the British 
			isles. For the first time, canonical authors mingled with newly 
			visible writers; English accents were heard next to Anglo-Norman, 
			Welsh, and Scottish ones; female and male voices were set in 
			dialogue; literature from the British Isles was integrated with 
			post-colonial writing; and major works were complemented with 
			shorter pieces and "perspectives" groupings that brought literary, 
			social, cultural, and historical issues vividly to life.

			poets whose work has been collected and preserved in The Library of 
			America: Poe, Whitman, Longfellow, Pound, Crane, Frost, and Stevens.
       <br/>
       This carefully edited book collects much of Bishop's poetry and 
			prose--fiction, memoir, reportage, reviews--between two covers for 
			the first time. This edition is the first to contain all the poetry that Bishop 
			published in her lifetime - including the classic volumes North &amp; 
			South, A Cold Spring, Questions of Travel, and Geography III - and 
			an extensive selection of unpublished poems and drafts of poems, as 
			well as all of her published poetic translations. The volume also 
			brings together most of her published prose writings, including 
			fiction, reminiscences, travel writing about the places (Nova 
			Scotia, Florida, Brazil) that so profoundly marked her poetry, and 
			literary essays, including a number of pieces not previously 
			collected. The book is rounded out with a selection of 49 letters 
			written between 1933 and 1979, to such correspondents as Robert 
			Lowell, Marianne Moore, and Randall Jarrell. The result is a single 
			edition that offers a full-scale presentation of a writer of 
			startling range and originality, the perfect introduction for readers new to Bishop's work, and the ultimate 
			collector's edition for her many devoted fans.

        Nature and Science in Hellenistic Poetry
       </a>
       by M.A. Harber, R.F. Regtuit, G.C. Wakker (Hellenistica 
			Groningana: Peeters) contains the papers of the 'Groningen Workshop 
			on Hellenistic Poetry 8: Nature and Science' (Groningen 2006). 
			During the workshop, a first draft of the papers was commented on by 
			an international group of specialists in the field of Hellenistic 
			poetry. This volume deals with the interaction between 'nature and 
			science' and Hellenistic poetry, particularly the ways in which 
			poets were inspired and stimulated by the results of science and 
			incorporated them into their work. In the Hellenistic period, the 
			fields of nature and science on the one hand and scholarship and 
			poetry on the other hand touch and overlap to a large extent and the 
			boundaries between science and poetry were not as straight and clear 
			as they are today. The articles in this volume refine the general 
			picture somewhat further. They focus on various authors and topics, 
			e.g. Aratus, Nicander and Callimachus, medicine, astronomy, and 
			geography.
