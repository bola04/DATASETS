   <h2>
    THE PAPA WOLF BRAND IS RETIRING BUT WE ARENâ€™T!
   </h2>
   <div class="copy">
    <p>
     It is with great excitement that I share the news that we've been acquired by Iron &amp; Air Magazine. I've been friends with the guys at Iron &amp; Air for many years now and the quality of their work speaks for itself. It was a no brainer for us to combine forces when the discussion around I&amp;A diving into retail and expanding their offerings came up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The store name will be changing to Iron &amp; Air but the mission will remain the same: Carry the quality products that we love and use and give the best damn customer service on the planet! Myself and Ashley are both staying onboard to run the day-to-day of retail, so you will still be interacting with us and getting the same level of service you've come to appreciate and expect.
    </p>
    <p>
     I want to thank all of you for your support over the years and we encourage you to continue to support us in this new endeavor and we invite you to visit the new site and come see us at the new store!
    </p>
    <p>
     Keep the shiny side up,
    </p>
