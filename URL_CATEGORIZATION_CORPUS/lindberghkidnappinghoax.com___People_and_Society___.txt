begged him to give it back Lindbergh stubbornly refused saying it would be an
insult to Germany.   It has been, for over 60 years,  part of the
Lindbergh Collection at the St Louis Missouri Historical Society were Lindbergh
donated this highly offensive possession which he continually, even after the
war, refused to denounce.  It has been viewed by thousands of people as
part of a touring Lindbergh memorabilia exhibit throughout the country. 
Much worldwide respect would have come Lindbergh's way had he publicly retracted some of his 
"values" before he died in 1974.  Lindbergh found no fault, no mistake, no
regret nor any corrections necessary in his own behavior or values.  He
believed he was a perfect individual - everyone else was wrong. At the time of his death he continued to
maintain a belief that the U.S. should not have fought Hitler.

some of these pages, at age 16,  
she was very quickly threatened by the editor of a New Jersey newspaper claiming to have copyrights to some of the photos she 
originally used here. That newspaper is a diehard political supporter of David
Wilentz - the man who ruthlessly prosecuted the unfortunate defendant.

    The intimidation of a high school
student (though she actually
listed all of her sources) is one of the reasons this website now exists.  Although some people may be disturbed by
some of the theories on this site,
they deserve to be tested in "the light of day."  Ronelle Delmont has revised and rewritten
all of Tania's
original 45 pages and will continue expanding this website in her
honor.  Tania's high school project was, in 1998, the only website
questioning the right of the State of New Jersey to kill a man under enormously
spurious conditions.
