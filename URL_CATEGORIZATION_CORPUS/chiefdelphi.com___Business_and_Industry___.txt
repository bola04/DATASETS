I made a post a while back about a swerve module that I've been working on for our team and received a lot of good feedback. I've changed a lot from that initial design and would like some more feedback before we decide to actually fabricate and assemble.

This year's new tool is our [URL=&quot;https://jmcautomotiveequipment.com/huth-hmrb6017-manual-rod-bender/&quot;]rod bender[/URL], pictured below.  Straight out of the box in our vise, we are able to bend 1&quot; wide x 1/4&quot; thick 5052 aluminum &quot;bar&quot; to a 1/4&quot; radius.  By adding a 1+&quot; long segment of 1-1/2&quot; galvanized pipe as a die and moving the piece every 20 degrees of bend or so, we can bend the same bar to about a 1&quot; radius.  We used this for our hooks to climb, and to build the first iteration of brackets to support ramps.  

Bonus: as we do not have a vise on our pit workbench (and it has wheels so is not suitable for this tool), I purchased a [URL=&quot;https://www.harborfreight.com/24-in-adjustable-jumbo-wrench-60702.html&quot;]24&quot; adjustable wrench at Harbor Freight[/URL] for $25 the night before Bayou.  Using these two together, we were able to adjust the bend of our hooks while they were on the robot!">

           <td class="alt1" title="I was using the Pathfinder library to generate and run a profile, and I decided to print out the left and right values that Pathfinder calculates. The robot looks good, but on the console, it prints that the left and right power are infinity? I isolated that the problem does not come from the turning calculations, but instead with the encoderFollower's calculate method. Then I checked my encoder to see if it was the thing that was acting up. It was a little off probably because it wasn't tuned, but not enough such that it would have such a dramatic effect. I also tried to use the DistanceFollower and I got the same results. The profile runs ok, but the values are infinity. 
Here is the code in question: 
[CODE]    public DrivetrainMotionProfileJaciEncoderCommand(PathGenerator path) {
    	leftTraj = path.modifier.getLeftTrajectory(); 
    	rightTraj = path.modifier.getRightTrajectory();
    	maxVelocity = path.maxVelocity;
    }

    protected void initialize() {
    	Robot.drivetrain.resetEncoders(); 
    	Robot.drivetrain.resetGyro();
    	leftFollower = new EncoderFollower(leftTraj);
    	rightFollower = new EncoderFollower(rightTraj);
    	leftFollower.reset();
    	rightFollower.reset();
    	//Wheel diameter in feet
    leftFollower.configureEncoder(Robot.drivetrain.leftBottomMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition(0), RobotMap.DRIVETRAIN_ENCODER_TICKS_PER_REVOLUTION, RobotMap.DRIVETRAIN_WHEEL_DIAMETER / 12);
    	rightFollower.configureEncoder(Robot.drivetrain.rightBottomMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition(0), RobotMap.DRIVETRAIN_ENCODER_TICKS_PER_REVOLUTION, RobotMap.DRIVETRAIN_WHEEL_DIAMETER / 12);
    	leftFollower.configurePIDVA(SmartDashboard.getNumber(&quot;Motion Profile P&quot;, 0.006), SmartDashboard.getNumber(&quot;Motion Profile I&quot;, 0), SmartDashboard.getNumber(&quot;Motion Profile D&quot;, 0.03), 1 / maxVelocity, 0);
    	rightFollower.configurePIDVA(SmartDashboard.getNumber(&quot;Motion Profile P&quot;, 0.006), SmartDashboard.getNumber(&quot;Motion Profile I&quot;, 0), SmartDashboard.getNumber(&quot;Motion Profile D&quot;, 0.03), 1 / maxVelocity, 0);
    }

    protected void execute() {
    	double leftOutput = leftFollower.calculate(Robot.drivetrain.leftBottomMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition(0));
    	double rightOutput = rightFollower.calculate(Robot.drivetrain.rightBottomMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition(0));
    	double gyroHeading = Robot.drivetrain.getGyroAngle();
    	double desiredHeading = Pathfinder.r2d(leftFollower.getHeading());
    	double angleDifference = Pathfinder.boundHalfDegrees(desiredHeading - gyroHeading);
    	double turn = 0.8 * (-1.0 / 80.0) * angleDifference;
    	Robot.drivetrain.tankDrive(leftOutput + turn, rightOutput - turn);
    	System.out.println(&quot;Left Power: &quot; + (leftOutput + turn) + &quot;Right Power: &quot; + (rightOutput - turn));
    }

    protected boolean isFinished() {
    	if(leftFollower.isFinished() &amp;&amp; rightFollower.isFinished()){
    		System.out.println(&quot;Path has finished&quot;);
    		return true; 
    	}else {
    		return false; 
    	}
    }[/CODE] 
PathGenerator is a class I made that create the path usingPathfinder when its constructed. 
Waypoints: 
[CODE]Waypoint[] points = new Waypoint[] {
			new Waypoint(0, 3.25, 0),
			new Waypoint(10, 3.25, 0),
			new Waypoint(24, 3.25, 0),
			new Waypoint(27, 6, Pathfinder.d2r(90))
	};[/CODE]
Plus my maxVelocity is 7.813 ft/sec and my max acceleration is 6.104 ft/sec^2. 
What causes the infinity? And is it something I should be worrying about?">

           <td class="alt1" title="No matter the year or what the game piece is, we've all seen some robot with a perfect intake that functions flawlessly and never misses a game piece. I'd like my team to get to that point, but we need some assistance. 

Every time we've built an intake in the past, there was a ton of &quot;build it halfway, decide to start over&quot; due to student inexperience. I'd like to have them build a good &quot;reference model&quot; that both current &amp; future students can take inspiration from, and have it be modular enough to quickly get a prototype up and running during build season.

As a summer project we're looking into having our mechanisms group design and build a modular intake that can be adapted to most types of game pieces. What are some of the best intakes you've ever seen, and what are your team's best practices for designing and building modular components like this? Any resources, photos, videos, etc are appreciated.

Thanks everybody! :D">

Are there any tricks teams use when setting up their drive train, or other systems driven by a chain, to keep it taut without a tensioner?'>

What was your [B]Coolest[/B] robot this year?
What was your [B]Most Elegant[/B]?
What was your [B]Most Effective[/B]?
And what robot made you say &quot;Man, that's [B]what we should have built[/B]&quot;?

My personal choices:
[B]Coolest:[/B] [B]5050[/B] is a team more people should know. Hailing from Michigan, their flip-up single stage elevator was the most effective one I've seen. they also had a pinch mechanism for cubes that was way more effective than it should have been and a scissor-lift climber that climbed almost every match in Carson. They were really awesome and I wish we got to play with them in Carson.
[B]Most Elegant:[/B] [B]254[/B]'s design was absolutely brilliant this season, and they executed it perfectly. It's not something every team could have executed, but their robot's ability to play every part of the field at the highest level was unparalleled in FRC this season, and their beautiful design was a large factor in that.
[B]Most Effective:[/B] Going into the championship, I felt like most of FRC still didn't know just how good [B]3357[/B] was. Their ability to pack layer 1 of a scale so tightly is a huge part of why their alliance was able to make Einstein finals, despite not being able to get as many cubes on the scale in autonomous. In addition to their ability to pack layer 1 with 7-8 cubes quickly and consistently, their layer 2 cubes were placed at the point of maximum torque on the scale, and their climb was heckin' consistent.
[B]What we should've built:[/B] I'm pretty happy with what 5254 ended up building, but we quite nearly went in a totally different direction this season. Had we taken that road less traveled by and been a switchbot, [B]6502[/B] is the robot I'd want to have built. This little shooter bot had a 2 cube scale auto, won a district, made finals at NC State, and was the 8th alliance captain in their division at South Champs.">

All FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge teams from Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are invited to participate in this two-day event where they will learn about how their government operates, develop the skills necessary to advocate for important issues, and travel to their state capital to discuss these issues with their representatives. 

On the first day, teams will gather together to listen to key speakers and work in groups to practice advocating. On day two, teams will travel to their state capital to put their new skills into action, speaking with their representatives about the importance of STEM.

Even if you already have a relationship with your representatives this will be a great opportunity to train team members what messages we should be giving them. With advocacy, the power is in numbers. The more people we can engage, the more effective we can be.

After assessing my team's opportunities for improvement, I wanted to do a better job of teaching my kids how to go about creating prototypes which are effective and useful. This is an area this team has not had experience in due to it not really being within their processes since inception.

Please add any additional resources, examples, or your favorite prototyping methods. Please provide videos and photos where possible.

What I have gathered so far are great examples of prototypes as well as video resources to help teams teach prototyping.

           <td class="alt1" title="OK, CD, there is something I need to get off my chest. Sorry, in advance for the long winded diatribe. 

Having been involved with FIRST for 4 years now as a parent and mentor, I have been amazed by what high school students in this program are able to do. The innovative designs that the students come up with each season consistently blow my mind. The fact that the students develop these designs with such intense schedule pressure makes it even more amazing. The engineering tools that are being used from hand calculations, to advanced spreadsheets and other simulations, to CAD and FEA, to programming are way beyond anything I was exposed to in high school. You guys all know this.

My gripe is this; why do the college admissions offices seem to care so little about robotics programs like FIRST? As I sat through the info sessions with my kids during the college campus tours over the past couple of years, several admissions officers at top engineering universities (Michigan, Georgia Tech and others) actually said that they dont want to hear about the robotics team in the application essays. One admissions officer, during her presentation asked for a show of hands of students that were on a robotics team. About half the hands went up. She then said When you are writing your essays, I dont want to hear about how the robot broke and you needed to fix it. She made it sound like she was bored by all the essays she has read about robotics. OK, I get it that the admissions staff may not be the best people to judge the technical capabilities of these students and essays are probably not the best vehicle to showcase these skills.

The head of the computer science department from one of the top state schools was a judge at one of the competitions this year. He happened to be an alumnus of my alma mater, so I had an opportunity to talk to him a few weeks after the event. It had been his first time at an FRC event and he talked about how impressed he was with the students and their creations. He indicated that he would definitely continue as a judge. At one point the conversation turned to the college admissions process. I pointed out to him that the college admissions officers were discouraging the students from putting too much about their robotics experiences and I suggested to him that the experiences and skills that these students were gaining in FIRST would give them a huge head start in their engineering degrees. In addition, they have already demonstrated the interest and aptitude needed to succeed which is probably a pretty good measure of whether they would stick with engineering rather than changing majors. While he admitted that these were the kids of students they wanted at his university, he stated that the engineering departments have no say in who gets admitted. I suggested that the engineering programs at his university might want to consider recruiting at the robotics tournaments. 

Dean likes to compare FIRST to sports and entertainment. I think this is a good analogy to use here. College sports teams recruit from high school sports teams. College performing arts programs have auditions for prospective students. Can you imagine a college football coach at an FBS school stating that he had no say in who gets admitted? Can you the faculty of the performing arts department not being a part of the auditions for prospective students? That would be unheard of! So, why do the engineering departments accept being left out of the process of selecting engineering students? And when you have such an interesting program that gives these prospective students an opportunity to develop skills and demonstrate their aptitude, why would you not want to use that as a significant factor in your recruiting.

Most of our district events here in North Carolina are at universities. Typically, someone from the engineering department at the host university will give a short speech at the opening ceremony to talk about what their school has to offer. But after that, the only real interest that the schools seem to show in the students is to set up an info booth in the mezzanine where someone from the admissions office hands out information packets and talks up the school. I have rarely seen anyone from the school walking around in the pits or asking students about their robots. And while it is great that some members of the faculty typically get involved as judges at the events, there is never any recruiting activity from these faculty members. And there is certainly not any feedback to the admissions staff from these faculty members about the students that would factor in to their admissions decisions.

Now, I recognize that robotics is not football. You are never going to have robotics competitions generating the kind of TV revenue for the university that college football does. But universities do get research funding from industry and government agencies. It seems to me that if you are recruiting the best engineering prospects that are interested in working on research projects, that, over time, you would be able to build the reputation of the school and attract more research funding from industry and government. Certainly, we see that industry is interested in FIRST. Boeing is sponsoring next years game. Many companies support the FIRST program at various levels. Why isnt this interest from industry translating into interest from universities? 

Each year Dean presents us with opportunities to make it loud. I think this presents a great opportunity to make it loud. If college engineering programs recruited from programs like FIRST, I think a lot more students would get involved (just like they do with football or other activities). Im not even taking about scholarships here. Im just talking about assessment of technical aptitude from members of the engineering department. If students knew that getting involved in programs like FIRST gave them an opportunity to be directly recruited by a university for their engineering program, giving them extra consideration in the application process, then I think a lot more students would seek out teams and high schools would be more likely to start a team. Perhaps if the sponsors of FIRST made it clear to the universities that they recruit from that they want to see more students with these kinds of skills, the universities would start to scout these students and would allow (or even encourage) the engineering staff to participate in this recruiting process.

Out to the FIRST community

Effective July 1, 2018, the NEMO (Non-Engineering Mentor Organization) website will go offline and we will no longer be taking registrations to join NEMO. The private forum on the chiefdelphi.com forums will remain. 

In 2004 we had a spark of an idea - what if there was a group to support all the mentors and parents who were doing so much to support teams, helping with all those tasks that needed to get done outside of building the robot? What if there was a welcoming place to ask questions, to share ideas, both online and in-person -- for business plans, fundraising, feeding teams, travel, team building, MOUs, and parent involvement? What if we invented a word - non-engineering? What if we just included adults - but it could be any adult connected with a team? What if we registered people so we could get a little information on who they were and gather some statistics?  

NEMO was born. Over the past 14 years, we have hosted dozens and dozens of in-person NEMO meetings, including an annual meeting almost every year at World Championship. Kathie created and maintained a website and we personally absorbed all expenses for NEMO outside of the room provided at Championship. We responded to hundreds of emails and registered hundreds of mentors who identified themselves as NEMs on teams. There were very few resources available from FIRST so we welcomed resource papers contributed by the community to help all teams. Throughout this process and over the years a huge community of practice was identified. And imagine our surprise when the words non-engineering mentor organization appeared on the FIRST website! 

We have watched FIRST grow, both at HQ and teams. In 2009 we helped HQ put together a Mentor Resource Library using many of the resources we gathered from NEMO. We both served as FIRST Senior Mentors (Jenny, 2004-2009) (Kathie, 2007-2015) and have worked cross-program and worn many hats. We have been so fortunate to have had the pleasure of knowing so many mentors and students.

And now it is time for us both to move on to other projects. It is our wish that local groups still organize to host NEMO workshops. These have been especially popular in New England. 

Thank you for taking this ride with us! Be well and Go Teams!

7) Each district gets to determine how many DCCA, DEI, etc. awards will be up for grabs at DCMP. What is this amount for Texas?

           <td class="alt1" title="Hello All,

I am writing this as a follow-up question to Mike Betts post on this thread:
[url]https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38539[/url]

Which Was: [QUOTE](1) Make both the motor and generator the same type of motor. 

(2) Wire a power resistor across the generator's electrical &quot;outputs&quot;. Be careful to size the resistor properly. 

(3) Measure the voltage and current at the &quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot;. Also measure the speed at the spindle/coupler.

(4) Adjust the input voltage to a known value (in our case it's almost always 12.0V). Note that you do not need a precision high current power supply... Just use an Exide SLA and let it slowly discharge as you run the MG and take your readings at 12V.

Note also that you can ignore (4) depending on exactly the type of data you are going for...

For a given load resistance, you will take your readings:

Input Power (W) = Input Voltage (V) * Input Current (A) 
Output Power (W) = Output Voltage (V) * Output Current (A)
Mechanical Power at coupler (W) = [Input Power (W) + Output Power (W)] / 2
Torque at coupler (N*m) = Mechanical Power (W) / Spindle Speed (radians/sec)
Power Lost in Motor (W) = Input Power (W) - Mechanical Power at Coupler (W)
[/QUOTE]

This sounded like a great way to DIY at home so I mimicked this type of setup with a adjustable DC Load as my power resistor and I collected a bunch of data.   Now I am going over the data I collected and I wanted to check back about the testing methodology I used as far as how well it should work out.    That said I am not looking for something super accurate, but I was hoping to get reasonable numbers using this method.

In my tests I used 2 sets of different 550 series DC motors rated for 18v.  Set 1 was identical and set 2 were identical to each other.   These were motors approximately the type you may find in a 18v drill.

From my research to similar motors I expected these motors were rated for approximately 200-250w maximum with maximum efficiency to be at 6-10amps.

Below is some of the data I collected on the two motors.  Does it look like I did this right?   Knowing that the stall torque should be just under 500(mN-m) does the operating torque I measured seem right?

Any help, suggestions, and feedback would be truly appreciated!

Thank you!

[SIZE="5"][B]Announcing the 2018 Hudson Valley Rally FRC Offseason Event Page[/B][/SIZE]

Team 5123, the Yonkers High School Mechadogs, in conjunction with the New York University, Robotic Design Team, is pleased to announce the third annual Hudson Valley Rally Offseason FRC Event on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering (Brooklyn Campus) located at 6 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, NY. Catering to FRC teams from New York City, Long Island, Westchester and the greater NYC Metro Area, we are welcoming up to 30 teams to this awesome event!

This year, our event is being generously sponsored by New York University, and with a whole new location, the event is sure to be a blast! In the spirit of FIRST Power Up, we will concurrently be holding a retro video game hack-a-thon where teams will be tasked to build a retro-video game according to a specific theme, present it for judging and have a chance to win a cash prize!

Also due to our new location, our registration fees have been increased from $250 to $300, however, we are offering the first ten teams who register before July 31 an Early Bird registration cost discount of $250. There is an additional charge of $15.99 for credit card orders made via this website as well.

For more information about the event, feel free to message us on Chief Delphi or email the event coordinator, Theodore Kim, at [email]teddykim@nyu.edu[/email].

GamePlan is a novel Android application that allows teams to effectively strategize upcoming matches by configuring a complete field and outlining potential alliance strategies.

The app provides a empty field for drive teams and strategists to customize accordingly for matches. Users can quickly add robots and cubes to the field while also drawing out potential movements of these robots.

Plans can be saved and restored with ease for matches at later times or later competitions. This feature allows teams to pre-strategize matches for expedited efficiency during match planning.

I realize that we are now in the post-season but I hope teams use this as an opportunity to try out FRC Gameplan throughout this post-season and see how it would fit in their match planning for 2019.

The app is available on Google Play. If anyone has any feedback, please do not hesitate to contact me at [email]atifniyaz11@gmail.com[/email]

Tableau has changed their licensing model. They now sell a bundle of Tableau products called Tableau Creator. This is pushing everyone to a server based model. 

Any idea how or whether FIRST will continue to get a Tableau license in the kit of parts?  Anybody heard anything?

I imagine that teams that want to take advantage of this would get a free Tableau Online account as well? Maybe?">

           <td class="alt1" title="Free end mills! Sort of, you still have to pay for shipping... 

My employer, and a sponsor of the Grasshoppers, goes through end-mills like they're nothing. We 'dust' graphite alignment pads on our product (inkjet print heads) to ±7µm, and when the mills start to deflect an extra 2-3µm we have to ditch them. This results in throwing away hundreds of end mills every year that are in near-perfect condition, but are 'worn out' for print-head purposes. Having examined them under a microscope myself it's nearly impossible to tell that they've been used at all. 

So, that's where the giveaway comes in. I have rescued a lot of these from the trash, and would like to send them out to teams who want some nice, free, end mills. I've used them to mill titanium and SS with great success. They can be used to mill aluminum, and if you keep the chips clear and the aluminum cool they cut hilariously fast with a wonderful surface finish. Plastics are a little more challenging because of the tight helix angle, but can be milled nicely. 

1/4in OD, 3/4in flute length, 5-flute (variable pitch, I think), 2.5in long, 1/4in shank, TiAlN coated.

I am happy to ship these to any one, or any team, interested in getting them to use with their own machines. Let's limit it to 5x per user for now, but I might change that depending on interest. Send me a PM and I'll send you my PayPal address asking for $7.25 (USPS flat-rate padded envelope) and for you to put the shipping address in the paypal text field. Send $7.25 as a gift or $7.76 if not a gift. This will help me send the giveaway to those who've paid!">

It's quite a hot topic here since the change isn't idle to all teams (and at least one team already purchased tickets to Houston)....

A big issue is that we were told that moving to Detroit will decrease the amount of champ slots Israel will have next year (this year we had 15 Slots...)

This move is for one year only and it wasn't announced that there is going to be some sort of &quot;switch&quot; with another region.">

However, WOWnd believes the [U]true[/U] missing ingredient is a recurring semi-anonymous preview/recap post on Chief Delphi.  We intend to rectify the situation here and now. Unfortunately, we only thought of it pretty much here and pretty much now.  We apologize to all the teams we were not able to discuss throughout the season. 

Nevertheless! We are excited to give everyone a preview of what West/Central PA, OH, and  WV has to offer in the next few weeks.  WOW teams headed to Champs are in bold :

[SIZE=&quot;4&quot;][B][U]How They Punched Their Tickets[/U][/B][/SIZE]

[B]The well traveled Hall of Famers :[/B]

We lead off with a team that has the bluest banner of them all, last years Championship Chairmans [St. Louis], [B]2614 (MARS)[/B].  Southern latitudes seem to suit this team, as their robust martian-red scale scoring machine brought blue banners from Palmetto and Smoky Mountains home to West Virginia this year.  On frigid shores at Buckeye, they were the #1 selection, but were unable to turn it into a third banner (having to settle for their third regional Industrial Design trophy on the year instead).  Could the next trip north bring more hardware for the Mountaineers?

Traveling in the opposite direction, [B]120 (Clevelands Team)[/B] is the only WOW team headed to Houston.  In their namesake city, this nimble bot had no trouble soloing the vault - requiring only half the match to do so.  That left plenty of time for switch attack and their low-profile hook to tack on a climb.  They captured the Einstein title as a second round pick in 2016.  Theyve built a robot this year which can certainly follow that same recipe for success.

[B]Maybe black powder coating is the secret :[/B]

While the top contender from West Virginia is the black-and-red bot discussed above, one of the top contenders out of Ohio sports black-and-purple.  Featuring an autonomous that, if you squint, reminds one of a black-and-blue bot from out west, is [B]4028 (Beak Squad)[/B].  They brought the innovation in control award and, after a hard fought three round finals, a Wildcard spot out of MVR.

[B]Like UMBC over UVA but with robots :[/B]

The Beaks autonomous powered them to the #1 seed at GPR.  Having put up the regional high score with this team in qualifications, the Beaks confidently picked fellow avian enthusiasts [I]217 (Thunder Chickens) [FiM][/I]. The #1 alliance rounded out with [B]5740 (Trojanators)[/B], a highly capable everybot-style switch attacker that already had a ticket to Detroit from Engineering Inspiration at MVR.  Reminiscent of the Chickens trip to GPR last year, the Quarterfinals were not without controversy, and some bad luck.  The first matchs autonomous saw the Chickens score to the wrong switch side, and the Beaks to move to the wrong side of the scale. Did the FMS send incorrect switch/scale position data?  In any case, combined with a critical break to the Trojanators gripper, the top alliance was not able to recover.  They lost two straight to alliance #8.  But, all three members of GPRs alliance #1 will come into Detroit with repairs made, autonomous modes tuned, and ready to make a statement.

[B]4028 - [the #] 1 [alliance] = 4027 :[/B]

With the #1 seed out, the race at GPR was wide open.  In the #2 position, [I]303 [FMA][/I] decided to TEST the waters of western PA by selecting [B]4027 (Centre County 4-H)[/B].  Matching its arcade-game silhouette, the 4-H teams machine was putting up video-game like numbers on the scale.  With the second selection, the alliance added an O to pair with Centre Countys W (get it [U]WO[/U]W) and selected [B]6032 (Pirate Robotics)[/B].  An ultra-low center of gravity vault/switch bot, they looked to be the first Pirates to win a title in the city of Pittsburgh since 1979 (sorry Bucs fans).

[B]Speaking of City of Champions :[/B]

The GPR playoffs featured teams that were qualified (or would qualify) for Champs up and down the bracket.  [I]4522 (Team SCREAM) [MO][/I] was looking to win a regional on the #3 alliance for the second time this year, after triumph from that same spot at Heartland.  But the #6 alliance had other plans plans.  Their first pick, [B]3504 (Girls of Steel)[/B], was ready for another deep run after capturing the #3 ranking (and a Wildcard spot) at MVR.  The GoS rock-solid scaler can go toe-to-toe with any and all challengers and powered through quarterfinals.  In a 3-game semifinal, the #2 and #6 alliances both scaled to the brim.  It all came down to the vault, with the Pirates of the #2 alliance making the difference to capture the win.  But the Rosie inspired team wasnt done riveting the GPR crowd yet, as their winning Chairmans video was the one to roll at the end of the event.

Back on the field, on the other side of the bracket, the #5 alliance sported an impressive resume of their own.  Fresh off a win with MARS in South Carolina, [I]5472 (Stallion Robotics) [FL][/I] gladly accepted an invite from [B]4145 (WorBots)[/B] of Columbus, OH.  Like the Girls of Steel and Centre County 4-H, the WorBots WorDown opponents with a stream of cubes up on the scale.  The final member of the alliance, [B]337 (Hard Working Hard Hats)[/B], was also keen to capture the GPR prize.  The last time they did so (2015) was their opening act to Carver Division win in St. Louis.  With the Hard Hats putting in workmanlike effort on the vault, the #5 alliance went on the WorPath, securing a sport in the finals against alliance #2.

The GPR finals lived up to the scale-battle hype, with neither alliance having more than a 1 or 2 cube lead at any time, and multiple late-game back-and-forth tilts. In the end, the teeter tottered to the #2 alliance, and they walked away with the banners. #5 didnt leave feeling too bad though. Between the Wildcard and the Hard Hats Engineering Inspiration win, all three members would be headed to Champs.

[B]Creativity in Cat-tion :[/B]

All this talk of GPR risks overlooking 2018s WOW dynamic duo, starting with [B]379 (RoboCats)[/B].  Though they can place cubes on the scale with the best of them, the RobotCats claim to fame is certainly their climber.  Able to take two bots along for the ride, the RoboCats racked up the highest average qualification ranking score (2.96) of any team in the WOW region. Ranked #1 at MVR and #2 at Buckeye, the Cats had their pick of the litter for a first alliance partner.  Both times, they called on the services of [B]291 (CIA, Creativity in Action)[/B].  Employing an effective and unique design (they appear to be the only championship-bound WOW scale bot without Andymarks compliant wheels, for instance), the CIA frequently spied 2 cubes up on their scale in autonomous.  

Having seen the potential of their scale synergy and climb cooperation in a Saturday morning MVR qual match, the pair was ready to roll in the playoffs.  However, the semifinals saw them fall to a stiff alliance #4, featuring two FiM teams who would go on to win 3 districts between them. Undeterred, they got the band back together on the #2 alliance at Buckeye.  Again they faced a strong Semis challenge, featuring the quick over-the-head style vault filling of MVR Chairmans winners, [B]3324 (Metrobots)[/B].  But it was the Cats/CIA teamup that moved to the finals.  

Wildcards secured for all finalists, the last matches at Buckeye looked to determine only medal color - but it was a classic nonetheless.  Having fallen just short one week prior to a WOW/FMA teamup at GPR, the WorBots were back in the finals with a partner from the east of their own, [I]3314 (Mechanical Mustangs) [FMA][/I].  The only team to see playoff action at all three WOW-footprint regionals, the WorBots were unfazed after losing the first finals match.  The second match saw win for the wors, and a breakdown of alliance #2s vault robots gripper.  Tagging a team off the reserves to handle vault duties for the final match, the RoboCats and CIA couldnt quite get in sync with their new partner - and the #4 alliance claimed their hard-won banners.

[B]Get Your Game On, Go Play :[/B]

The WOW field rounds out with three teams who missed regional playoff action, but could be called up as championship teams look to add vault/switch specialists.  First, [B]5413 (Stellar Robotics)[/B] has a robot capable of placing on the scale, but like the Metrobots, theyve found their over-the-head cube manipulator does its best work near the alliance wall.  Capturing Engineering Inspiration at Buckeye, theyll look to hone their vaulting skills and possibly add in a climb while theyre at it.

WOWs pair of rookie representatives leads off with MVR All-Star [B]6936 (Beaver Bots - Vault 6936)[/B].  With vault in their name, they decided to throw a changeup and play the switches most matches.  Driving more confidently in each outing, theyll look to keep the momentum going in Motor City.  In Buckeye, the low-profile [B]6964 (Upper Arlington)[/B] took the All-Star award.  Focusing on the vault, this team looks to continue pushing down their cube cycle times in their second-ever event as a team in Detroit.

*Our sincerest apologies for whichever awards (or entire teams) we inevitably missed*

[SIZE=&quot;4&quot;][B][U]Reckless Prognostication[/U][/B][/SIZE]

With roughly 400 teams in Detroit, 12% will captain an alliance, and a further 36% will be selected.  Well wave our hands and apply those ratios directly to the 14 team WOW contingent.  The result is 1.7 captains (let's be optimistic and round up to 2) and a further 5 teams selected :

Alliance Captains: [B]379, 2614[/B]
First Rounds Picks: [B]4028[/B]
Second Round Picks: [B]291, 4027[/B]
Third Round Picks: [B]3504, 4145[/B]

But, those projections are qualification power rankings as much as anything.  If an alliance is in the market for a compact vault or switch attack specialist, look for [B]6032[/B] or [B]3324[/B] to make the bracket over the scale specialists above (ditto for [B]120[/B] in Houston).


[SIZE=&quot;4&quot;][B][U]Final Word[/U][/B][/SIZE]

Will WOW be able to make some noise on the fields in Detroit?  Can WOW capture a Championship Chairmans banner for a second consecutive year?  Did we violate Chief Delphis terms and conditions by making an unverified anonymous account?  Will [I]The MARtian[/I] be the one writing for a quarter of these teams next year?  Find out all this, and more, next time from [I]All WOWnd Up[/I]!">
