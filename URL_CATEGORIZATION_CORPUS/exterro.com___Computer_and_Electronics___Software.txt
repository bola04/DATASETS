            When looking for a partner who is going to help you achieve a goal it's very important that you have confidence in that partner and that they are going to be with you throughout the whole journey. It's not a simple sales cycle where after the deal is done, they are move on. I really felt with Exterro, and the client success team in particular, that we were going to have that relationship.

            The Exterro tool will pay for itself within the first year, because we can produce our own data and can do smaller subpoenas in-house. The cost benefit seems so clear when you lay it out, but people are so darned scared to take that leap, because it's an unknown. Everyone is used to saying, 'Just farm that out,' but that isn't always cheaper or the most efficient way of doing things. When we asked for the budget, we said, 'Here's what we spent, here's what it costs for these new tools, and here's what we can save in a year.' It was several millions. With the Exterro platform, it’s much cheaper to hire a full-time employee to manage the whole end-to-end process than it is to send things to third-party vendors.

            The Exterro tool will pay for itself within the first year, because we can produce our own data and can do smaller subpoenas in-house. The cost benefit seems so clear when you lay it out, but people are so darned scared to take that leap, because it's an unknown. Everyone is used to saying, 'Just farm that out,' but that isn't always cheaper or the most efficient way of doing things. When we asked for the budget, we said, 'Here's what we spent, here's what it costs for these new tools, and here's what we can save in a year.' It was several millions. With the Exterro platform, it’s much cheaper to hire a full-time employee to manage the whole end-to-end process than it is to send things to third-party vendors.

            Before we had the Exterro Suite, the e-discovery process was very manual, done mostly by IT at the request of legal. We needed a tool to grow with us, and Exterro to grow with us.

            The Exterro tool will pay for itself within the first year, because we can produce our own data and can do smaller subpoenas in-house. The cost benefit seems so clear when you lay it out, but people are so darned scared to take that leap, because it's an unknown. Everyone is used to saying, 'Just farm that out,' but that isn't always cheaper or the most efficient way of doing things. When we asked for the budget, we said, 'Here's what we spent, here's what it costs for these new tools, and here's what we can save in a year.' It was several millions. With the Exterro platform, it’s much cheaper to hire a full-time employee to manage the whole end-to-end process than it is to send things to third-party vendors.
