           Tourists and New Yorkers alike want 
            to know the "real New York." Thus the need for community 
            tourism. As opposed to mass market tourism / community tourism is 
            organized by the stewards of their communities. These tours take visitors 
            into areas not on the typical tourist map and connect them to local 
            music / immigrant history / parks / waterways / architecture / cuisine 
            / artists / murals / and one-of-a-kind stores. To help popularize 
            community tourism in New York / we have created this / the City's 
            first online guide.

         Art as politics reaches new intensities in the Whitney Museum’s 
            disturbing and powerful new exhibit of film maker Laura Poitras’ 
            selection of videos and documents to define the U.S. government’s 
            threats to liberty after 9/11. stro Noise, the name of the show, comes 
            from the faint background disturbances of thermal radiation left over 
            from the Big Bang, the start of our universe.

         Sneakers are a way of life. As we ride the subway each day, 
            our eyes are drawn to the colorful row of feet across from us. Sequins, 
            studs, stripes- each shoe is incredibly different and is a means of 
            self-expression. It hasn't always been this way though. The Brooklyn 
            Museum's "The Rise of Sneaker Culture" is an interesting 
            combination of a cultural-artifact review and analysis of social history.

         The Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York, less than an hour

            of hot-button subjects and important contemporary artists, both emerging 
            and established. The museum's current "must see" exhibition, 
            "Animating The Everyday," is a ten-year survey of the work 
            of South African born, Berlin based artist Robin Rhode. By Edward

         Everybody knows the famous bowler hat that is the icon of Belgian 
            painter René Magritte. That makes it especially fascinating to see 
            the trajectory of the artist during his prime surrealist period, thirteen 
            years between the world wars. Magritte said himself in a 1938 lecture 
            that those years were the most crucial of his work. This is one of 
            the Museum of Modern Art’s major shows. By Lucy Komisar.

         <br/>
         An underappreciated name on the East Coast, contemporary artist Llyn 
            Foulkes is far better known out west for his diverse array of works. 
            Born in Yakima, Washington, Foulkes made a name for himself in Los 
            Angeles, where he had his first solo exhibition in 1961. The recently 
            opened exhibition at The New Museum at 235 Bowery serves as a career 
            retrospective for Foulkes, while also being Foulkes’ first exhibition 
            at a New York museum, featuring a huge diversity in medium, subject 
            matter, and style. By William Gutierrez.

         Jay DeFeo (1929–1989) set a fiercely independent course, and 
            the astoundingly diverse range of art she created over more than forty-five 
            years defies categorization. She made works that can be measured either 
            in inches or in feet, in ounces or in tons, and which range from painting, 
            drawing, jewelry, and photography to various hybrids that confound 
            traditional classifications.

         The blues has become one of America's basic music language. Since 
            the publication of W. C. Handy's “St Louis Blues” sheet 
            music in 1914, known to be the song that popularized the blues, it 
            has swept through the globe and is now ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm 
            &amp; blues and rock'n roll. With its new exhibition, “Blues 
            for Smoke,” on view until April 28, 2013, the Whitney Museum 
            of American Art explores a large array of contemporary art, from the 
            1950s to the present, through the lens of blues as an artistic sensibility 
            and cultural idiom. By Adele Bossard.

         <br/>
         It is quite unusual to think of Picasso's work as composed of a black 
            and white palette. But Picasso once claimed that “color weakens” 
            and his exploitation of the black and white colors transcends all 
            the established periods that have been assigned to his artistic career. 
            The exhibition “Picasso Black and White” at the R. Solomon 
            Guggenheim Museum in New York pays tribute to this facet of his prolific 
            career, featuring 118 black and white paintings, sculptures or works 
            on paper, realized between 1904 and 1971. By Adele Bossard.

         <br/>
         Each year, OPEN, one of the most entertaining art exhibitions in the 
            art world, peppers the beautiful island of Lido with unexpected and 
            imaginative sculptures and installations. Essentially an outdoor walking 
            tour with a few in-hotel installations, OPEN begins the minute you 
            disembark from the vaporetto onto the Piazzale St. Maria Elisabetta. 
            It continues along the shop and restaurant laden Via Lepanto, morphs 
            into the lushly planted promenade of Lungomare G. Marconi, and ends 
            overlooking the beach, at the very chic Hotel Westin Excelsior, the 
            infamous hangout of the Venice Film Festival crowd. This year Madonna 
            and George Clooney, followed by lusting hordes of screaming acolytes, 
            was all the rage. By Ed Rubin.

         With originality and vision, Gene Kaufman has created a space 
            that beautifully intersects theater and art. Located quite literally 
            north of history (north of the Museum of Natural History), this dual 
            space acts as a beautiful and inspiring art gallery by day, and like 
            Cinderella, magically transforms into a cozy and intimate theater 
            at night. By Rachel Beck.

         "All of the artists are superstars in their own right, 
            but they have never been put together like this in such a small scale," 
            says curator Awam Kmpka, as he explains how this concept turned into 
            a collaborative exhibit at Aicon Gallery. Ten artists came together 
            from Morocco, Senegal, India, Nigeria, Algeria, Pakistan and Ghana, 
            to make statements about the human condition using textiles as their 
            motif. By Kamoier Williams.

         People know about time shares for sharing vacation rentals, 
            and gym memberships for shared workout spaces. But who has heard about 
            studio shares for art studio rentals? In 2017, it is still extremely 
            difficult for artists to find affordable studio space with rising 
            rents pushing businesses and families out of New York City. That's 
            where SmArt Space Studios comes in. By Kamoier Williams

         <br/>
         After spending the better part of an hour studying the paintings of 
            Haile King Rubie at his first solo show, "Speaking Colors" 
            (July 27-August 17, 2017) at the newly opened Clara Frances Gallery 
            in Harlem, I was struck by the depth of feeling that Rubie was able 
            to paint into each of his canvases. It is rare to find a painting 
            that not only feels alive and talks to you, but works its way into 
            your heart. And here, in this exhibition, the twenty-six year old, 
            Harlem based artist gives us 12 such paintings plus, each one telling 
            a story that deeply mirrors his own life experiences, inside, out, 
            and around. Add to this curator Julia Slaff’s intelligently 
            written story-telling wall texts and labels and what you have is a 
            near-perfect installation.

         The Japanese identity has long been questioned and dissected through 
            Japanese art; its discourse is abundant in conceptual, aesthetic and 
            literary meaning. The works presented at the Friedman Benda gallery 
            attest to the creative muscle of the Japanese contemporary art scene, 
            particularly in terms of the integration of technology with traditional 
            media now that we are in the digital epoch. However, this exhibition 
            reveals the blunder of a title too ambitious. By Claire Taddei.

            American exhibition in ten years devoted to the most significant and 
            internationally recognized living artist of France. A major representative 
            of French abstractionism, Soulages is distinguished by his use of 
            black. It is both aesthetic and philosophical; it has always been 
            part of his work. By Claire Taddei.

         <br/>
         In April 2012 the four creative souls behind the Smith Street Tattoo 
            Parlour in Brooklyn decided to close their shop for one week to focus 
            on their artistic development. They participated in the first Raking 
            Light Projects artist-in-residence program at Mullowney Printing , 
            San Francisco, where they were guided by the Print Master himself, 
            Paul Mullowney. For seven 18-hours work days the four artists would 
            etch and carve sensitive sheets in order to make true fine art prints. 
            The work has resulted in four individual amazing projects that when 
            put together form an even greater common artistic project, which is 
            defiantly worth defying the cold to see. By Ina Stinus.

         Mary Hrbacek’s solo exhibition "Peopled Forest of My Mind" 
            curated by Elga Wimmer on view at the Creon Gallery in New York City 
            from April 10 to 30, 2013, features Hrbacek’s new, very small 
            and very large, personified tree paintings. Inspired by her dense 
            dramatic charcoal drawing, executed on stark white paper, Hrbacek 
            cultivates eerie hybrid plant forms as they emerge through the drawing 
            process, coaxing these unfathomable figural apparitions into coherent 
            energized human-like entities that disclose the organic origins of 
            all natural systems. The works stress our primal link to nature in 
            an increasingly high tech global existence. Edward Rubin's conversation 
            with the Artist Mary Hrbacek.

         <br/>
         Jitka Hanzlová's work has something of a travel back in time. 
            Her current exhibition “There is something I don't know,” 
            at the Yancey Richardson Gallery is made up of several portraits of 
            men and women facing the camera and looking to it in a three quarter 
            or full profile, with a dark background reduced to the minimum. For 
            this series, Ms Hanzlová has captures contemporary people in 
            a background from the Renaissance, giving to the pictures a touch 
            of timelessness. By Adèle Bossard.

         "Visual Conversations" is culled from the collection 
            that Emily Fisher Landau bestowed on the Whitney Museum and highlights 
            numerous artists she has been collecting in depth. With different 
            works for each artist, it opens a dialogue among them and brings together 
            various stages of their creative process. The "visual conversation" 
            can exist as a time line between various artworks by the same artist, 
            brought together for the first time, or between different artists, 
            echoing each other. By Adèle Bossard.

         <br/>
         The Lure, Dubai/Toronto based artist Janet Bellotto’s exhibition at 
            the De Luca Fine Arts Gallery, intellectually engaging in the infinite 
            number of ideas that it conjures up, is at its very root, sensuous, 
            seductive, and romantic, albeit in a self-contained and carefully 
            orchestrated manner — meaning that despite the traditional feminine 
            aesthetic inherent in the work – read flowers and perfumed fragrances 
            – there is not one ounce of sentimental gush or sappiness. By Ed Rubin.

         The Good News is that the Missing Head of the great Herkules Denkmal 
            that stands high above the City of Kassel has been restored! Few who 
            come to Kassel to see dOCUMENTA (13), however, even realize that Herkules 
            is silently standing High Above them, looking down on what passes 
            for Contemporary Art in the Land of Hesse in 2012. It may seem Odd 
            that—in 2012—this is the 13th dOCUMENTA. But the 13 has 
            nothing to do with this Actual Year—possibly even less to do 
            with Art as it was once Understood—but only that this is the 
            Thirtheenth of these wide ranging Art Exhibitions.

            comprises the recent work of an eclectic group of eight New York City-based 
            artists. As its title and subtitle imply, the human figure informs 
            storytelling, whose attendant connotations of fantasy, intimacy, and 
            attentiveness set the exhibition’s tone. By Earl Miller.

         Finishing law school in 2012 was, in so many ways, a huge victory 
            and emancipation. After overcoming the numerous obstacles that come 
            with a brush with the criminal justice system, I felt hugely empowered 
            and inspired to help others with similar experiences. By Angela Torregoza.
