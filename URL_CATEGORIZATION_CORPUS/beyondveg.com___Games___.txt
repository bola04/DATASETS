   The material presented on this site
  </b>
  comes from individuals with years of hard-
  <wbr>
   won experience either practicing alternative diets or observing those who do. As you'll find, no two writers will necessarily agree on all topics. A unifying theme, however, is the intent to squarely acknowledge and discuss the sometimes serious problems that can occur on alternative diets but often go unreported, and to go beyond the simplistic dogmas readily available elsewhere--
   <wbr>
    in fact almost everywhere--
    <wbr>
     to "explain them away."
     <p>
      A sense of admirable idealism is often a motivating factor encouraging people to take responsibility for their own health and to explore different diets. However, the development of emotional attachments to philosophies underlying such diets can often end up becoming far more important for some individuals than the results they obtain--
      <wbr>
       or fail to. One result has been widespread refusal in the alternative diet community to face health and behavioral problems that may arise on these diets. A common thread in what you'll read here is that a kind of subjective, "blinded naturalism" has become more or less endemic in the vegetarian, raw-
       <wbr>
        food, and alternative diet movements, which can lead to serious health troubles.
        <p>
         We hope the range of views presented here will encourage--
         <wbr>
          perhaps even force--
          <wbr>
           you to think for yourself and go beyond the need for reliance on any single authority in evaluating the worth and workability of a diet. Especially if you have experienced problems yourself, you will know how crucial it is to remove the proverbial rose-
           <wbr>
            colored glasses and face the issues discussed here openly, rationally, and realistically.

                Scientific research is preferred, but fair-

                 minded anecdotal evidence is acceptable in areas where no relevant research is available.

                 Note to hard-line types: Despite claims to the contrary, remember that anecdotal research is sometimes used (though perhaps more informally) in professional nutrition and even medicine, where it's referred to as "case studies." Also, the publication of anecdotal evidence is frequently responsible for uncovering areas later pursued in peer-
                 <wbr>
                  reviewed research, and has its value when little formal knowledge of any kind is available. As many of the topics discussed on this site have been little-
                  <wbr>
                   studied as yet in terms of rigorous research, it is our belief that anecdotal evidence in these areas is worthwhile, at the least, to stimulate interest and uncover topics worth a

                Folks, it should go without saying, but we know and you know that you take full legal responsibility for whatever decisions you make regarding your own health care. What we offer on this site is for informational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice. The whole point here is that you think clearly for yourself and make your own decisions, with the input of a licensed health professional should you choose to consult one. So if you try to come back on us saying we attempted to convince you otherwise, you don't have a legal leg to stand on. Got it? What we all need is more individuals like yourself who will own up to their own doings and resist the temptation to contribute further to our ridiculously litigious society. (Spread the word!)
