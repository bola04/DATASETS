      Blackjack is the umbrella name for a vast variety of
                      games that fall under the ‘21’ category. The basic objective
                      of all these games is similar – to make a hand where the
                      card values are as close to 21 as possible, and to beat
                      the dealer’s hand in the process. With the onset of online
                      blackjack games however, software companies were quick
                      to rise to the challenge and create different versions
                      of blackjack games that can be found in reputable online
                casinos across the internet today. You can play blackjack on your computer or opt to play

      Playing Online Blackjack Games
     </h2>
     <p>
      For most intents and purposes, playing blackjack games
                      in an online casino setting is similar to playing it at
                      a brick and mortar establishment. The main, and obvious,
                      difference is that when playing online blackjack, the
                      player could be sitting in his or her living room at 3
                      am wearing nothing but pajamas…
     </p>
     <p>
      Nevertheless, online blackjack games follow the same
                      rules as its offline versions, against the dealer and
                      for real cash. When deciding on an online blackjack experience,
                      players first need to ensure that the casino they have
                      chosen offers the type of games they are after. Beginners
                      may want to stick to the more classic versions of blackjack
                      until they have the game down. Another thing to look out
                      for is stake limits. Players should make sure that the
                      table that they are playing at has stakes that fit into
                      their budget. Again, newcomers should stick to low stake
                      games until they build up their confidence in the game.
     </p>
     <p>
      Online blackjack is a game of skill, meaning that if
                      players take a few necessary steps, they can easily bring
                      down the house edge considerably. One of these steps is
                      to learn the basic strategy linked to blackjack. This
                      strategy teaches players how to play their cards, depending
                      on the combination of cards they are dealt. Online blackjack
                      is played against the dealer and the other players around
                      the table have no impact on the game whatsoever. The game
                      is traditionally played with 1 – 8 decks of cards and
                      according to strict house rules. Blackjack card values
                      are as follows: two through to ten – face value; Jack,
                      Queen and King – 10; Ace – one or eleven. Once players
                      have found a casino and a blackjack table where they feel
                      comfortable, the next step is to start playing. Players
                      first place a bet by choosing the denomination and bet
                      amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      The dealer deals two cards to the player and two to himself.
                      In some versions of online blackjack, players can opt
                      at this point to take an insurance bet that the dealer
                      has been dealt a 21. The bet is lost if the dealer does
                      not. Players view their two cards and decide on how to
                      play their cards. They have a number of options, namely
                      hitting, standing, splitting, doubling down, even money
                      or surrendering.  Hitting is a request for another card,
                      in the hope of advancing towards making a hand value of
                      21 (without going over that number). Standing is the act
                      of not asking the dealer for anymore cards as the player
                      feels that this is the best hand to be made. Splitting
                      rules differ from one black jack game to another but it
                      generally means dividing two cards of equal denominations
                      into two separate hands. Doubling down means that players
                      can double their original bet. More on the various terms
                      can be found on our
