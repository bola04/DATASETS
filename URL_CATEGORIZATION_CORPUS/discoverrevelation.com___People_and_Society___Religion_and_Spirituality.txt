       Much time has been devoted to the gathering of the
enclosed information. I am but a simple lay person with a deep desire to
educate those who are honestly seeking the truth. I do this to be faithful to the
Great Commission of Jesus Christ as He told us in Matthew 28 verse 19 to go
out and teach all nations (In case you don't already know, the nations
mean the people - everyone). He is telling us that we are to proclaim His
gospel to not only our friends and neighbors, but also to those throughout
the entire world. What greater a place to do that than on the world wide
web that can be seen and read by people virtually everywhere.

         Those seeking the truth will find God's written Word,
the Bible, to be the final authority, in all that they seek. As for Salvation
issues, there should be no conflicting views contained here. There will
be differences of opinion about exactly what and the timing of events
that take place in the Book of Revelation. Those events are subject to
interpretation but they are not a salvation issue. Some will interpret
the how, what, and even the timing in the book of Revelation differently
depending on their method of interpretation. Christians should be able
to discuss those differences without fighting over their meanings. But when
it comes to salvation issues, there should be
         <u>
          NO
         </u>
         differences of
opinion.
