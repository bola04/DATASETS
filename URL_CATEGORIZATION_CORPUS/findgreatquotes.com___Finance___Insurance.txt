     FAQs
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Q: Is my data safe?
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      A
     </strong>
     : 100% safe. We only work with advisers and brokers who are directly authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. We will never pass your details to anyone else.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Q: Is this service free?
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      A
     </strong>
     : Yes, completely free to use.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Q: Why should I compare?
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      A
     </strong>
     : High street banks and insurers spend lots of money on TV and newspaper advertising to encourage you to buy products just from them. Only by comparing all of them together can you see who has the deal that’s best for you.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Q: Am I under any obligation to buy the product you suggest?
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      A
     </strong>
     : None whatsoever. Our partners will present you with a range of options but at the end of the day, the decision is yours.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Q: Can I request to be called at certain time?
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      A
     </strong>
     : Yes absolutely, you can either apply or call when you’re ready to compare a policy or you can request that you get a call back at a certain time.
