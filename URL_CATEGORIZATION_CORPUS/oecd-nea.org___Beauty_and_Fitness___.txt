      <strong>
       First reactivity-initiated accident test completed successfully at the renovated CABRI facility
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Within the framework of the NEA CABRI International Project (CIP) a first test simulating a reactivity initiated accident (RIA) in conditions reproducing those in a pressurised-water reactor (PWR) was successfully carried out on 16 April 2018. The test was performed at the Cabri facility in Cadarache, France by the
      <em>
       Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire
      </em>
      (Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety - IRSN), with the support of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), in the new pressurised-water loop that was installed recently as part of a major renovation programme.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The NEA CIP Project investigates fuel and cladding behaviour in PWRs during RIAs that involve a sudden localised accidental increase of core power that would arise from, for example, control rod ejection. The CIP began in March 2000 and two RIA tests using high burn-up PWR fuel were performed in 2002 in an experimental loop filled, at that time, with liquid sodium. "After ten years of major refurbishments, the Cabri reactor is now equipped with a new configuration that will enable the NEA CIP Project to study the safety behaviour of fuels in more fully representative PWR conditions," noted the NEA Deputy Director‑General and Chief Nuclear Officer Dr Daniel Iracane. "The successful completion of this test positions Cabri as a new major asset for the continuous enhancement of our knowledge base, and for the future of nuclear fuel safety worldwide."

       Webinar on Full Costs of Electricity Provision
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On 13 April 2018, the NEA organised a webinar to discuss the findings from its latest report –
      <em>
       The Full Costs of Electricity Provision
      </em>
      . Market prices and production costs account for an important share of the overall economic impacts of electricity. However, there has been a growing recognition that the market value of electricity is not the whole story. As currently constituted, the price of electricity in today's markets does not accurately reflect the costs of electricity on the society and the environment. As a result, decisions made regarding supply and future planning based on current market prices fail to capture all of the factors needed to ensure reliable electricity supply in the future. This report summarises and synthesises the most recent research in full cost accounting of electricity. Find out more at
