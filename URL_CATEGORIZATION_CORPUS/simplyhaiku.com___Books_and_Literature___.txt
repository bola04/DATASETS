        published 
	its last issue in the Winter of 2009. It was a quarterly journal created by 
	the dedicated efforts of a team of volunteer editors and webmasters and was 
	contributed to by a vast number of today's writers and artists in the genres 
	of haiku, senryu, tanka, haibun, renku, and traditional and modern haiga.
        <em>
         Simply 
	Haiku
        </em>
        also offered articles, interviews, and book reviews featuring 
	renowned figures from the international Japanese short-form poetry community 
	along with reprints from other journals that merited wider distribution.

        In particular, the 
	contribution of Robert Wilson is notable who along with Rob Mestre founded
        <em>
         Simply 
	Haiku
        </em>
        and who then played a key role in attracting writers from the 
	haiku world. Also notable was the behind the scenes service of Associate 
	Editors Johnye Strickland and Carol Raisfeld, and of Keith Heiberg, who 
	served as Webmaster/Web Editor. Also behind the scenes, Mike Rehling, the 
	owner of the
        <em>
         Simply Haiku
        </em>
        website and domain name,Â generously 
	contributed the service provider that allowed the journal to show up on 
	computers in homes all over the world. The Archives have been secured and 
	will remain available for readers to enjoy and for scholarly research 
	through the searchable Contributors' Index. Copyrights reside with the 
	individual contributors, whose permission should be sought for reproduction 
	in any form.

        All of this was, 
	of course, orchestrated by the spirit of poet-monk Matsuo Basho (1644-1694) 
	who somehow reached out to all of us from the distant past and who is 
	represented here by the frog looking on to the bud of the idea of
        <em>
         Simply 
	Haiku
        </em>
        in 2003 to its full flowering as the years progressed.
