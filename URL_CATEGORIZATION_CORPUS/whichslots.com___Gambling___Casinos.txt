        Charles Fey invented the first slot machine in the late 1800s. but don't blame 
        him - Bugsy Siegel started the craze when he furnished his Flamingo Hilton hotel 
        with slots back in the late 1940s as enterainment for the wives and girlfriends 
        of his high-rolling friends. The rest is history. America can't seem to build 
        slot palaces fast enough!
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="/slots-type">
         So, 
        Which machine is which?
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Slot machines have a universal appeal because, 
        unlike other casino games, you can play them at your own pace and they don't require 
        any skills. They are the least understood of all the gambling options. In most 
        other games, the odds are quantifiable, which means you can determine the odds 
        by applying some math on the disclosed rules. But, aside from specified minimums 
        set by law, the player has almost no idea what the payoff of the slot machine, 
        and which slots they can choice. The minimum return percentages are vary from 
        stats to stats in American, the minimum payout are set at 75% in Nevada and 83% 
        in Atlantic.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Here's some tips before you decide Which Slots to Play
       </h2>
       <p>
        1. 
        Remember that Slots cost money. They are a fun source of entertainment but anything 
        that costs money is serious. So treat Slots games seriously and spend your money 
        responsibly.

       </p>
       <p>
        2. Always bet the max number of paylines. Your best bet at winning is to 
        win the jackpot, and the only way to get the jackpot is to always bet the max 
        number of paylines.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. Keep an eye out for special situations. Super high 
        jackpots or Slots that haven't paid out in a long time.
       </p>
       <p>
        4. Look for Slot 
        machines that offer high bonuses, bonus rounds.

        more detail about The Bonus Multiplier
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        5. Look for Casinos that offer 
        1st time customer bonuses, giveaways and comps.
       </p>
       <p>
        6. The flashiest Slot machines 
        aren't always the best to play. Read the Paytable, check the payout percentage.

        you can find 
        out.
       </p>
       <p>
        7. Contrary to the myth, Casinos don't put "Loose" slot 
        machines in certain areas and tight slot games in other areas. When you enter 
        a casino look around and figure out which machines are loose and which a tight.

        in Slot Machine.
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        8. Don't be afraid to talk to the Hosts, at a casino. 
        They are there to do things for YOU. Ask them for comps, ask them for freebies. 
        It can't hurt.
       </p>
       <p>
        9. Playing slots with friends is always better than by yourself. 
        What's even better is playing a single slot machine with a group of friends. All 
        you have to do is agree to share the jackpot and you can all drastically increase 
        your chances of winning a lot of money.
       </p>
       <p>
        10. Enjoy yourself. Slots are entertainment. 
        Don't get too caught up in winning. Always remember that the more fun you're having 
        at slots the less money you'll spend and the more satisfied you'll feel.
