           I found out that the publisher of the "non-profit" is earning over $450,000 a year once you factor in salary, benefits, and pension.

           Clifford Durand is a student at St. John's University who recently threatened to "smash" a "bitch" in his class because she had a Donald Trump sticker on her computer.

           None of the people who speak out about "harassment" against women will have anything to say aboutÂ Clifford Durand's Tweet, which now has over 14,000 RTs.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's OK to "smash a bitch" when she holds ideas you disagree with.
          </p>
          <p>
           Jack Dorsey and the rest of the Twitter team will not stop this act of violence. They play favorites and do not truly care about the welfare of women or any of their users.
          </p>
          <p>
           You won't hear anything from Jezebel. No one cares.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's OK to threaten a woman if she supports someone running for President whom you don't like.

            How do we know the man who takes pictures of women before talking about "smashing" them is Clifford Durand?

           Friends on Twitter referred to him as "Cliff" and "Clifford."

         </h5>
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody">
          <p>
           Marc Randazza is a lawyer's lawyer. When someone threatened you with a lawsuit or some up drama came up, Randazza was the man you called. He was more generous with his time than any lawyer I'd ever known. As one of his many lawyer-clients, I'd practically have to scream at him to send me a bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           Randazza fought hard for free speech and even led the fight against revenge porn. (Read:
           <a href="http://www.pissedconsumer.com/blog/2016/01/who-really-killed-revenge-porn-sites-our-lawyer-marc-randazza/" target="_blank" title="Mard Randazza killed revenge porn">
            Who really killed revenge porn?
           </a>
           )
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            When a case went south for Randazza, you'd wonder if he ever helped anyone at all - as most ofÂ these lawyers he helped wereÂ silent or secretly shared hating on him.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Is Marc Randazza a fraud? To the shock of many like myself, who would trust Randazza with our lives, that's the question many haters are asking.
          </p>
          <p>
           Randazza had something happen to him thatÂ could happen to any of us. He was sued by a former client, the client offered $200,000 to settle the case, and Randazza kept fighting. Randazza thought he wouldÂ win the case.
          </p>
          <p>
           After drawing a arbitratorÂ whose decision strikes me as the product of corruption rather than legal analysis, Randazza's reputation was in tatters. (Read:
           <a href="http://blog.simplejustice.us/2015/11/06/randazza-wrestled-with-a-pig-and-this-time-the-pig-won/" target="_blank">
            Randazza wrestled with a pig, and this time the pig won
           </a>
           .)
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Most peopleÂ have no idea how corrupt our arbitration system is.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Unlike in a court of law, you're not allowed to cross-examine witnesses before an arbitrator. You're also not allowed to appeal the arbitrator's judgment against you.
          </p>
          <p>
           A arbitrator - honestly or corruptly - can lie about you, and there's nothing you can do about it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Where are the hundreds of lawyers Randazza hasÂ helped? Are they standing up for him?
          </p>
          <p>
           Mostly they are silent, as most lawyers are gutless cowards and manipulators.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Is there a "big lesson" from Randazza's current struggles?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I find an angle we can all look at, though perhaps I'm too close to the subject to see much here.
          </p>
          <p>
           The truth is that most people you help are going to turn their back on you. In a time of crisis, you'll learn this.
          </p>
          <p>
           The truth is also that some people will come out to support you in ways you'd never have imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
           Until you face an attack on your reputation and career, you won't know, although there are some signs to look for.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            If you don't see people raising help and kicking ass for others today, they will not have your back tomorrow.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm friends with a lot of misfits.
          </p>
          <p>
           But they all share one thing in common. They are raising hell. They don't hide from conflict. They may fight for causes I don't agree with, but they do fight.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you're not a fighter, I don't want you in my life. You'll turn your back on me just as many have turned their backs on Randazza.
          </p>
          <p>
           But there are a few fighters left, and they will fightÂ for their friends.
          </p>
          <p>
           Seek them out. Set aside political disagreements and other dramatic nonsense. Focus on what matters. In a fight, they'll have your back.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Randazza is still my lawyer and friend, and yes I'd trust him with my life. One dishonest arbitration award will not undo a lifetime of strong work.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I got to talk to Randazza about the Gregory Allen Elliot case and more. Watch it here.

           Devin McCahey is a student at Iowa State University. Yesterday on Twitter he told me:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            straight white people literally like ur an abomination and don't deserve the same rights as others. Be grateful we aren't just killing you.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Mr. McCahey also tagged me in this Tweet and then protected his Twitter account to avoid exposure.
          </p>

           <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://federalism.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf6e653ef01b7c7e25436970b-pi">

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Although I do not read that Tweet as a death threat, it is striking to me in its anger and hate and perhaps mental instability.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            "Be grateful we aren't just killing you."
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           No, I won't be grateful you aren't killing me and other straight people, Mr. McCahey.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope Iowa State University police officials look into this matter immediately, as this is the type of stuff a school shooter would say.

           would be the next major "civil rights battle" were dismissed as tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorists. Yet the push for pedophile acceptance has begun. To the surprise of many, pedophile acceptance has some surprising allies.

           <strong>
            Everyone from Salon to Twitter to National Review are defending pedophiles.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Salon published a lengthy article from an admitted pedophile. In this article the pedophile, who has worked around children and admitted in chat rooms to hugging children closely, shared his tale of woe.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Iâve been stuck with the most unfortunate of sexual orientations, a preference for a group of people who are legally, morally and psychologically unable to reciprocate my feelings and desires. Itâs a curse of the first order, a completely unworkable sexuality, and itâs mine. Who am I? Nice to meet you. My name is Todd Nickerson, and Iâm a pedophile.
           </p>
          </blockquote>

            I'm a pedophile, but not a monster
           </a>
           ."
          </p>
          <p>
           Rather than treat pedophilia as a grave moral wrong, pedophilia is treated as an innate sexual identity. Pedophiles are no different from gays, the author of the Salon article wrote, and thus deserve civil rights.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            National Review supports pedophiles.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Astoundingly, Charles C.W. Cooke of the "right wing" National Review wrote an article defending Salon's piece.Â Read, "
           <a href="https://archive.is/uYktz" target="_blank">
            On Salonâs Much-Maligned Pedophilia Piece
           </a>
           ."
          </p>
          <p>
           While Cooke did not give child rapists a full throttled defense, his article gave moral authority and cover to Salon. Pedophiles, Cooke argued, should not be forced to remain in the closet.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Salon again supports pedophiles.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           After receiving support from National Review, Salon next published a piece decrying pedophile-phobia, a problem existing on the right. Liberals, it seems, find pedophilia acceptable. Fortunately the right (excluding National Review writer Charles C.W. Cooke) took a stand:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            With regard to angry respondents to my article, the greatest amount of flak has come from the far right, who smeared Salon for daring to allow me to speak, as if silencing pedophiles somehow equates to fighting sexual abuse.
           </p>

           Anyone who speaks out against pedophiles is bigot spreading hate speech in an effort to silence those who would have sex with children - if only the laws were changed legalizing the practice.

          <p>
           Sarah Nyberg (formerly known as Nicolas) is a prominent social justice warrior and Twitter user. Leaked chat logs revealed Nyberg was something else - she/he was a confessed pedophile.
          </p>
          <p>
           LEOPirate, the user who exposed pedophile Sarah/Nicholas Nyberg, was suspended from Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
           Twitter allows an admitted pedophile to use its service while suspending the account of the person who exposed the pedophile.

           As someone who has written about free speech for a decade or so, I've seen people come and go. I've seen the quality of writing decline. Men are afraid of writing about free speech candidly as currently it's women who are making the push for censorship. If you criticize a woman, you will be called a misogynist.
          </p>
          <p>
           How can you maintain your intellectual integrity without being called mean names? It's hard, and these rules won't last forever. But there's a way to thread the needle. For now, anyway.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Rule 1. Virtue signal hard. Yes, you know that boys drool and girls rule!
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Let people know that harassment against women is a huge issue, and you totally oppose it. You just also believe in free speech. Wring your hands for several paragraphs, explaining how much you love and adore women.
          </p>
          <p>
           Make sure you write
           <em>
            harassment against women
           </em>
           is a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           Do not talk about harassment generally. Do not point out that men are harassed online by men and women. No, that is doing it wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
           Women also never harass other women. Only men harass women. Strike that. Only straight white men and conservative gay men (likeÂ Milo Yiannopoulos) harass women.
          </p>
          <p>
           Do not mention that I was doxed by Zoe Quinn (

           If Anita Sarkessian says that calling her a liar is harassment, then by golly that's harassment. Forget that she said on video that she did not enjoy playing video games, and thus she lied when she said, "I'm a lifelong gamer."
          </p>
          <p>
           Do not make fun of Anita. She is the Queen Bee. You will feel her sting.

           If you're a white straight man, your day is coming. Sooner or later you'll use the wrong terminology. This is especially true as you get older. Who can keep up with all the made-up words like TERF and transmisogyny?

           A recent book entitled "
           <em>
            John Scalzi is a Rapist
           </em>
           " was pulled from Amazon's ebook store after John Scalzi used his considerable connections as a best-selling author to have it removed. Scalzi has previously threatened legal action, but wisely backed down after being advised he did not have a case for defamation.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Thus, here is what we currently know about the John Scalzi rape accusation.
           </strong>

          <p>
           1. He wanted to sue, but was unable to.
          </p>
          <p>
           2. He used his connections to have the book removed.

           Doth the (alleged) rapist protest too much?

          <p>
           While guilt by association tactics are used primarily by the left, it's worth nothing that Scalzi is good friends with Jian Ghomeshi, a man who has raped around a dozen women.
           <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/06/16/jian-ghomeshi-surrounded-by-admirers-during-wait-for-trial-magazine.html" target="_blank">
            Jian Ghomeshi is currently awaiting trial on several counts of rape
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           John Scalzi is also close friends with Chris Kluwe, who signed a gag order forbidding him from talking about "underage girls" found in "compromising situations." See, "
           <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/general/writer/gregg-doyel/24628550/chris-kluwe-cant-be-moral-crusader-after-his-cruel-twitter-rant" target="_blank">
            Chris Kluwe can't be a moral crusader after his cruel Twitter rant
           </a>
           ."
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           Chris Kluwe never spoke truth to power, instead accepting money to cover up what appears to have been statutory rape.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://federalism.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf6e653ef01b8d1524842970c-pi">

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Chris Kluwe Â takes money to remain silent about rape or rape culture, and Scalzi counts him as a friend.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            The Sarah Nyberg/Chris Kluwe/John Scalzi connection.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Again, guilt by association tactics are wrong, but they are what people like Scalzi rely upon. Thus Scalzi concedes they have a place in discussing rape accusations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sarah Nyberg is an admitted pedophile who John Scalzi and Chris Kluwe have vigorously defended and stood behind. In chat logs exposed by a whistler blower, Nyberg expressed her admiration for her 8-year old cousin named Dana.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           With friends like these, one must ask: Is John Scalzi a rapist?
          </p>

           <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://federalism.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf6e653ef01bb086ca964970d-pi">

           <strong>
            At this time I cannot determine whether Scalzi is a rapist.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           My hunch is that he's hiding something, and I would not be surprised if women later come forward against him, as it often takes rape victims years to come forward against celebrities like Bill Cosby and Jian Ghomeshi.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           Is John Scalzi a rapist? We might never know.

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody">

           I'm not a political junkie who sits around watching CNN or FoxNews. I don't know who the big names or personalities are, and I don't care. For the most part politics are reality TV for men - part wish fulfillment, part distraction from a life of quiet desperation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet unfortunately my own freedom and survival have required me to seek change. This is annoying to me, but unless the cuckservative (members of the right who enjoy watching people like me get screwed over by the radical left) take a stand, they may as well get used to having me around.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cuckservatives haven't left me many options. Here are my choices:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Sit by silently while no one has our backs.
           </li>
           <li>
            Play nicely, as I have done for years, hoping I will get through to these people.
           </li>
           <li>
            Put them on blast, attacking them more ruthlessly than I do SJWs.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Sitting back silently is never going to work.
           </strong>
           I'll always have something to say, which means I could play nice.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Playing nicely hasn't worked.
           </strong>
           Not a single member of a Republican-controlled Congress spoke out in favor of due process during a hearing discussing the college campus rape "crisis." College men are about to see their rights curtailed. What have Republicans done? Watched.
          </p>
          <p>
           When Gawker attacked me, Reason.com joined in the dog pile. Without contacting me or reaching out, a Reason blogger put me on blast for my "mean Tweets." Reason, a "libertarian" publication, is part of the same call-out culture and plays by the same rules of social justice "journalism" as Gawker. No, I won't play nicely with such people.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            This leaves option three, which is to to put cuckservatives on blast.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I almost feel bad for the cuckservative who have recently discovered me, they aren't aware of what they have gotten themselves into.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a lawyer who has been sued for defamation (and won), lawsuit threats make me LOL. I know where the line between free speech and defamation lies, and yes I know all about anti-SLAPP laws. Your legal threats mean nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also have more energy than the cuckservative, as I live a healthy lifestyle, go to the gym, and understand the power of mindset. Your personal attacks or attempts at manipulation mean nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
           You deserve no mercy. You would watch as men go to prison on false rape convictions. Do you think I won't reveal your affairs and other indiscretions out a sense of kindness or decency?
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't merely write about policy issues. I write about individual people. If you're living a lie, it will be exposed.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you fancy yourself a celebrity or personality, my advice would be to start having our backs. At the very least, be careful when running your mouths. If you ask for my attention by calling everyone who uses the #cuckservative hashtag a racist or anti-Semite, don't complain when you get my full attention.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can keep attacking us or calling us racists. You can keep reaching out to the same protesters who disrupted a Bernie Sanders political rally, because hey - you surely have more credibility with the #BlackLivesMatter crowd than Bernie, and your outreach will be highly successful.
          </p>
          <p>
           What are my demands?
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            America should have a wall on its border just like Israel has.
           </li>
           <li>
            Call out "rape culture" for what it is - another form of Satanic Panic.
           </li>
           <li>
            Stop buying into the left's frame on race. You should never use the word "racist" non-ironically.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Maybe others need more, but that's all I need.
          </p>
          <p>
           I know you won't listen, as you're fat and bloated like all members of the establishment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just don't say you weren't warned. Don't cry when I reveal embarrassing facts about you.
          </p>
          <p>
           The stakes are too high for me to say anything other than, "Cry more."

           (conservatives who enjoy watching their friends get screwed over by the left), the attacks have come. The attacks are not from social justice warriors (my usual adversaries). No, I've been attacked by people on the right!

           The attacks from various cuckservativesÂ are meta-commentary on the nature of the cuck. Never once has Nick Searcy or Kurt Schlichter (had to Google him) reached out to me in friendship. Instead they attack me on Twitter, in public, to status signal they are good boys who "didn't do nuffin."
          </p>
          <p>
           Their arguments are trite and easily defeated.

           Do not engage in serious discussions with them about the issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, we have intellectual arguments. We could tell them a country is not based on lines on a map. A country is the people who live on the soil.
          </p>
          <p>
           America is great because the Americans who build America are great. If we want to make America great again, we need to screen who we allow into the country our grandparents built.
          </p>
          <p>
           We could ask them why they support nationalism for Israel but not for the United States. Israel has a border, and Israel is even an enthno-state, based primarily around the identity of the people. Israel has a right to exist as a nation. America, too, has the right to exist as a sovereign state.
          </p>
          <p>
           We could explain that every race and ethnicity except whites engage in identity politics.Â Claiming whites cannot form voting blocs based on race is itself racist.
          </p>
          <p>
           We could painstakingly explain that Republicans win elections when whites - as every other race and ethnic group does - vote as a bloc. See, "
           <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/11/08/the_case_of_the_missing_white_voters_116106-2.html" target="_blank">

          <p>
           We could ask them why it's worth risking alienating millions of white voters to skim off a few hundred thousand black voters. We could ask them to show us their data and projections explaining their position. Do conservatives want to win elections or get nice articles written about them in

           ?
          </p>
          <p>
           But they do not have any response, as they live in fear of being shamed by the radical left, and they assume you too are driven by a fear of shame.

            Always change the frame. If they attack a misfit on your side, ask them why they care more about your friends than about their supposed enemies on the left.

          <p>
           Quite frankly, there's no one using the #cuckservative hashtag who is a worse person than Al Sharpton or Bill Ayers.
          </p>
          <p>
           As someone on Twitter put it, "Our 'racists' are on Twitter. The left's racists are in the halls of Congress and on television."
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Why then are conservatives more worried about a few trolls on Twitter than issues that matter?

           That, my friends, is a question that answers itself. #cuckservative

           For years I read a blog byÂ Vox Day, but to be honest, I had my concerns about the man. I thought it was weird that he pretended to have an attractive wife. Why do this?
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            John Scalzi, one of Vox Day's haters, had convinced me and others that Vox's wife did not exist.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           As Vox did not post pictures of his wife, I took Scalzi at his word that @spacebunnyday was a sock puppet.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://federalism.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf6e653ef01b7c7b7b7a2970b-pi">

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            I learned a valuable lesson about John Scalzi. He's a con man.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           After seeing John Scalzi joke about being a rapist on his blog, I decided to stop taking him at his word. I investigated the facts for myself. Vox Day's wife is real, and she's real cool.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            What's it like meeting the wife of an Internet misogynist?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Surely she is kept under lock and key and a singular look from her oppressor quiets her.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hah!
          </p>
          <p>
           Vox and his wifeÂ had a comfortable relationship one settles into after years of sharing a life with a person, yet there was none of the contempt often shown in the faces of long-term couples.
          </p>
          <p>
           Each had their own separate lives while sharing their family life. Vox plays soccer, Spacebunny is a bit of a "gym rat."
          </p>
          <p>
           While Vox was more interested in the quality of the wine, Spacebunny was highly concerned with the protein content of our meal.
          </p>
          <p>
           While this should only come to the surprise of "real misogynists" like Scalzi,Â Spacebunny also had her own views of the world. She even dared to disagree with me - a white man! - about some socio-political issues.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Who is the real misogynist?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           "Misogynist" has become a meaningless term, and I won't legitimize it by using it non-ironically.
          </p>
          <p>
           That said, denying a woman even exists because she disagrees with you, while perhaps not rising to the level of misogyny, does make you a pretty terrible person.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ultimately, however, Scalzi is filled with self-loathing and envy. A healthy full family life with an attractive women is beyond his reach.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rather than accept that Vox Day did better in the wife department, the Hugo-winning,
           <em>
            New York Times
           </em>
           best selling author refuses to believe Spacebunny exists.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some men simply can't say, "Life is a mixed bag. I got this whole author thing down, but my marriage is a bit of a mess. Oh well, that's life." They instead seek to attack and tear down others who have what they covet.
          </p>
          <p>
           Does that make Scalzi a misogynist deserving moral condemnation or a truly pitiable man deserving scorn and laughter?
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Yes, Vox Day's wife is real. SJWs like John Scalzi always lie.
           </strong>

           There's currently a War Against Men. False rape accusations are on the rise. Rape hoaxes like the Rolling Stone Rape Hoax and Mattress Girl are the norm. For decades the right has ignored my issues, as a man.

          <p>
           Cuckservatives control the right-wing airwaves. Have any of them reached out to me - someone who objectively speaking

          <p>
           The right has ignored me and other men - even more palatable men like those in the
           <em>
            A Voice for Men
           </em>

           When Gawker and MSNBC attacked me, where were these so-called "allies" on the right? Make no mistake, they knew of me. Indeed they care about me a lot since I've started putting them on blast.
          </p>
          <p>
           But when the right could sit back and watch while I was attacked, all was well. They pretended not to know me.
          </p>
          <p>
           These cowards on the right were either silent or they joined in the dog pile against me - with

           <strong>
            Indeed, the right's treatment of its friends is where the "cuck" term arises from. The right loves watching their would-be allies get screwed by the left.

           The right even purges people like Steve Sailer and The Derb for writing articles far less offensive than you'd find in

           There are many people - myself included - who believe America has a right to exist as a nation, and that a nation is not the soil, but the people who live on the soil.

           We would like America to have a border, much like Israel has. We would like to control who comes into the country our grandfathers built.
          </p>
          <p>
           When the right calls us racist for wanting a border like Israel's - and then calls us anti-Semitic for mentioning Israel at all - they are joining in the left's would-be cucking of us.

            Why does calling conservative men cuckservatives trigger them into PTSD?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Much like SJWs are triggered by words on Twitter, conservative men also suffer from PTSD when we call them cucks. Why?
          </p>
          <p>
           For whatever reason, conservative men talk of the pussification society. They've appointed themselves as spokespersons for masculinity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Meanwhile they don't even lift, they don't advocate for men's issues, and they are gutless hypocrites who turn on their "friends."
          </p>
          <p>
           They lack any sense of loyalty or honor, betraying their friends to impress the radical left.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cuckservative is a label that emasculates conservatives.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's a reminder that we know they are not men.

          <p>
           When the left rejects Al Sharpton, come talk to me about the "wrong people" on the right.
          </p>
          <p>
           Call me racist, sexist, homophobic, and keep telling lies about me.
          </p>
          <p>
           This will only speed up the demise of the cuckolded right.

           A cuckservative is a Republican who enjoys watching his friends on the right (and indeed his entire country) get screwed by the radical left.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative will never have the back of his "friends" or "allies," and instead often joins in the rapes of right-wing allies.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative will purge "wrong thinkers" like Steve Sailer, The Derb, and RamZPaul from the right even though the left gives Al Sharpton Â (an actual murderer and racist) and Bill Ayers (an actual terrorist) media platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative wants to be part of the establishment. They take their rules from Gawker and other social justice warrior run media sites.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative spends massive amounts of time status signalling (also called "virtue signalling") to the left.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative sells out his allies by calling them racist as part of their effort to signal their virtue and "good thinking" to the left.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative cares more about attacking Donald Trump (see virtue signalling, above) than in understanding why Trump has grown a huge audience. (Hint: Trump's rise is not due to his policy positions. Instead Trump's success is due to America's fatigue with supplicating cuckservatives bowing down to the media establishment.)
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative believes Israel's border must be protected at all costs, but that even suggesting America has a border is racist.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative wants to be part of the establishment. Being a "New York Times best-selling author" matters more to a cuckservative than making America great again.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative lives in terror of being labelled a racist.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative calls people who use the term "cuckservative" racist.
          </p>
          <p>
           AÂ cuckservative is so far up the SJW establishment's ass that they think we care.

           When a white woman claims to be black, you may claim the person is not really black and demand the person submit to DNA testing.

          <p>
           On college campuses and Twitter accounts everywhere, "threat" has taken on an overbroad definition. Merely disagreeing with someone is harassing and threatening conduct. Calling someone a bad name or hurting their feelings is a threat.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            But what is an actual, get-you-thrown-into-jail threat made online online?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Supreme Court was supposed to answer that question in
           <em>
            Elonis v. United States
           </em>
           , which involved a real piece of crap who posted stuff online that in my view seems quite clearly as threatening. The
           <em>
            Elonis
           </em>
           opinion answered one question while leaving another open.
          </p>
          <p>
           Quick background: A "true threat" is not protected by the First Amendment. Criminal threats made online are a federal offense underÂ 18 U. S. C. Â§875(c), which makes it a crime toÂ âtransmit in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another."
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            What is a "true threat"?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Now that we know true threats are a crime, we have to find out what a true threat is. At Elonis' trial for making threats online, the jury was told (emphasis added):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            âA statement is a true threat when a
            <strong>
             defendant intentionally makes a statement
            </strong>
            in a context or under such circumstances wherein a
            <strong>
             reasonable person
            </strong>
            would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an intention to
            <strong>
             inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual
            </strong>
            .â
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           The Supreme Court held in
           <em>
            Elonis
           </em>
           it is not enough for a statement to make a "reasonable person" perceive the defendant's statements as an expression of an intent to inflict bodily injury to cause death.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Court wrote:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            In light of the foregoing, Elonisâs conviction cannot stand. The jury was instructed that the Government need prove only that a reasonable person would regard Elonisâs communications as threats, and that was error. Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendantâs mental state.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Great, what is the standard? How can you show something is a true threat?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           In an opinion only lawyers will grok, which is something I dislike about the law as it has become outside the understanding of even highly intelligent people, the Court set up some goal posts. Sort of:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            There is no dispute that the mental state requirement in Section 875(c) is satisfied if the defendant transmits a communication
            <strong>
             for the purpose of issuing a threat
            </strong>
            , or
            <strong>
             with knowledge that the communication will be viewed as a threat
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           In other words, if government shows someone had the intent to make a threat, then it's a true threat. (How does the government prove what you intended? That's a question for another day!)
          </p>
          <p>
           Also, if the government can show you intended the communication to be viewed as a threat, then it's a true threat.
          </p>
          <p>
           But it's not enough to merely show that a reasonable person would have interpreted a person's words as a threat.
          </p>
          <p>
           Does that make sense? (Yes. No. Sort of. We shall see.)
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            In his concurring opinion, Justice Alito points out the
            <em>
             Elonis
            </em>
            ruling is, as the cool kids say, problematic.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Justice Alito correctly observed the confusion caused by today's
           <em>
            Elonis
           </em>
           opinion. In his concurring opinion, he wrote:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Did the jury need to find that Elonis had the purpose of conveying a true threat? Was it enough if he knew that his words conveyed such a threat? Would recklessness suffice? The Court declines to say. Attorneys and judges are left to guess.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Exactly.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            What's my take on
            <em>
             Elonis
            </em>
            on online threats?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Don't wish death upon anyone. Don't tell people you want to see them personally die.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even though
           <em>
            Elonis
           </em>
           suggests merely wishing death on others would quite clearly not be a true threat, why do it?
          </p>
          <p>
           There are enough ways to make your point without wishing death or bodily harm on another.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you don't want to address the arguments others make:Â Call people fat, call them ugly, call them stupid.
          </p>
          <p>
           But there is no reason to wish them dead.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you personally know someone, this is especially true.
          </p>
          <p>
           And never ever say you are going to personally harm someone, especially if you know that person or have a prior relationship making those words appear like an expression of your intent to cause bodily harm on or to kill someone.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            P.S.,
            <em>
             Elonis
            </em>
            clearly eviscerates social justice warriors.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           After
           <em>
            Elonis
           </em>
           , any intimation that disagreement or insults are online threats is the sign of mental instability.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Supreme Court is not ready to gut the First Amendment to

           Most of you have never heard ofÂ Josh McIntosh, the male ghost writer behind media powerhouse Feminist Frequency. Yet most of you, especially those familiar with GamerGate, are familiar with the smiling face of Fem Freq - Anita Sarkeesian.
          </p>
          <p>
           WouldÂ Josh McIntosh, a straight white man, exert such influence if he did not ghost writeÂ Anita SarkeesianÂ Tweets, script her cultural critiques of vidoe games, and produce her YouTube videos?
          </p>
          <p>
           If male privilege is real, why doesÂ Josh McIntosh have to put words intoÂ Anita Sarkeesian's mouth in order to have any relevance?

           Maggie Pless is a graduate student who gave up her promising medical career to harass me online and write a diary at the Daily Kos blog.
          </p>
          <p>
           Maggie, along with Zoe Quinn, posted pictures of my home as well as my home address online. Maggie finally admitted she doxed me, although she has yet to apologize.

           What "doxxing up" means isn't certain, although one familiar with his previous online campaigns - which included inciting an online hate mob into threatening Justice Sacco with rape and murder - would infer "doxxing up" has some racial component.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since Dash has 400,000 Twitter followers and a verified Twitter account, "doxxing up" would certainly have to include doxing him.

           Recently a woman named Brianna Wu, who made $13,000 a month on Patreon for doing nothing, wrote an article claiming #
           <a href="http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2015/04/what-is-gamergate.html" target="_blank">
            GamerGate
           </a>
           made death threats against her.
          </p>
          <p>
           She claimed no prosecutor cared about her story, because misogyny.
          </p>
          <p>
           Several bloggers, including some who claim to be journalists, ran with Wu's story. A fellow by the name ofÂ Cory Doctorow entitled his breathless article, "Brianna Wu uploads Gamergate death threat to shame Ohio prosecutor."
          </p>
          <p>
           There was, of course, a major problem with the story. As kids on the Internet say, "Y'all Â posting in a troll thread."
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Yes, that's right. Wu lied. She never called the police to report the "death threats."
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           When the prosecutor whose hatred of women caused him to ignore Wu was contacted - not by journalists who wrote about the story, but by concerned citizens - they learned
           <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/05/23/ohio-attorney-brianna-wu-wasted-time-and-resources-over-gamergate/" target="_blank">
            Wu never actually called the prosecutor she lied about to tens of thousands of people
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           (As Wu has been caught making threats against herself, it's likely she never reported the threat as that would be a felony. You can blog about death threats you made against yourself all day. But once you call that hoax into a prosecutor, watch out.)
          </p>
          <p>
           It appears to me Mr.Â Doctorow never took journalism classes. I'm going to explain to Mr.Â Doctorow and other journalists how they can perform some basic fact checks.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Step 1.When someone claims a prosecutor has ignored her complaints, do this first:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Contact the prosecutor.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           This cannot be overstated. Before destroying someone's reputation, you reach out to them. You know? This is just basic human decency.
          </p>
          <p>
           Surely Mr.Â Doctorow has some human decency. He simply did not know how to contact the prosecutor who he falsely accused of ignoring complaints a woman reported to him.

           <strong>
            Step 2. Google the name of the prosecutor.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Google is a website that allows you to type in stuff you want to learn about. For example, in her article Wu wrote, "The death threat you can hear in this tape comes from
           <strong>
            Columbus, Ohio
           </strong>
           . The
           <strong>
            prosecuting attorney
           </strong>
           in that district is
           <strong>
            Ron OâBrien
           </strong>
           . If he wished, he could bring criminal charges against this man by the end of the day."
          </p>
          <p>
           When you go to this website called Google and type Â "Columbus Ohio Ron O'Brien prosecuting attorney," you receive what's called a "search result."
          </p>
          <p>
           As you can see, the search result displays Ron O'Brien's web page. It has his contact information and everything!

           Prosecutors are usually called State's Attorneys, Prosecuting Attorneys, or District Attorneys. It varies based on state.

           Don't let the formalities slip you up. You can use "Mr." or "Ms."

           Here is a sample e-mail to send off:
          </p>
          <blockquote>

           <p>
            It recently came to our attention that your office had not been giving any attention to death threats received by [Brianna Wu/Anita Sarkeesian/Zoe Quinn].
           </p>
           <p>
            On what date did [insert name of professional victim] contact your office?

            Why has your office not responded to the complaint?

            Step 5. Write your article.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>

         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody">
          <p>
           People constantly try pinning down my views on race, much to their frustration. I have spent more time representing black men
           <em>
            pro bono
           </em>
           than any of my social justice warrior critics. Blacks are treated differently by police, and this is such a duh point that it's not even worth arguing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet I don't toe the party line. I don't join every hash tag campaign or eagerly signal to liberals that I'm a proper self-hating white man.
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't hate myself for being white. I don't "check my privilege." I rather like myself, actually.
          </p>
          <p>
           My views on race have evolved over the years. Well, my views haven't changed, but my approach has.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, I still recognize the criminal justice system is racist.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet why should I care about black issues when blacks do not care about my issues?
          </p>
          <p>
           I've noticed blacks do not care about, for example, black-on-white hate crimes. When groups of blacks jump or "wolf pack" white or Asian men, there is no outcry from the black community. The media doesn't declare it a hate crime.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, no one really cares much about what happens to white male crime victims. (No one cares about men generally, white or black.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, the criminal justice system is racist. Black kids will get the hammer laid down on them in a way that white men will not.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand,Â white are several times more likely to be victimized by a black assailant than a black man is to be victimized by a white.
          </p>
          <p>
           It'd be great if whites and blacks could get together, saying, "Yes, it's wrong that the criminal justice system is racist,
           <em>
            and it's also wrong
           </em>
           that whites are several more times to be the victims of inter-racial crimes than black are."
          </p>
          <p>
           But that's not happening.
          </p>
          <p>
           When blacks care about my issues, I'll care about theirs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Until then, they can fight their own battles.

            GamerGate
           </a>
           due to a love or drama or because some girl was caught cheating on her boyfriend with five men in order to obtain free publicity for her video game. Whatever. Nor do I care about the video games industry. What caught my attention in GamerGate was an unconstitutional restraining order Zoe Quinn obtained against her ex-boyfriend, Eron Gjoni.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2014/10/chelsea-van-valkenburg-akk-zoe-quinn-v-free-speech.html" target="_blank">
            The restraining order was unconstitutional, as my legal analysis shows
           </a>
           . I won't re-hash that here. What I want to focus on is how unfair the restraining order proceeding against Eron Gjoni was.
          </p>
          <p>
           Zoe Quinn sought to obtain an order of protection against Eron Gjoni. To obtain an order of protection (called a 209a order), a judge had to issue it. Moreover, the judge held a hearing to determine whether or not to extend the date of the protection order.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was able to obtain the transcript from the restraining order hearing. The transcript reveals two startling facts:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Gjoni wasn't allowed to even make a free speech argument to the court.
           </li>
           <li>
            Gjoni was not allowed to cross-examine Zoe Quinn, in violation of the law.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Eron Gjoni was not allowed to present a First Amendment defense.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           You read that correctly. When issuing a restraining order preventing a man from speaking out about the abuse he suffered, the trial court did not even allow Gjoni's lawyer to raise the issue.
          </p>
          <p>
           The official court transcript provides:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "[Gjoni's lawyer]: Judge, may I be heard on the First Amendment issues and the restrictions placed upon the defendant, within the scope of the original order?
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Court: Counsel, I'll leave that to your appellate rights. I've made my decision."

           </a>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
           The judge made his decision without even allowing Gjoni's lawyer to argue the law.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Eron Gjoni was not allowed to cross-examine Zoe Quinn.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Under the law, Gjoni had certain rights. For example, he had the right to cross-examine Ms. Quinn.
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, there is a manual judges are supposed to follow when conducting restraining order proceedings.

           You read that correctly. In the United States of America, in a courtroom where free speech principles are at stake, a sitting judge denied a man the most fundamental rights.

           After the transcript of the hearing surfanced, Quinn Â admitted she lied in court to the judge. She claimed her memory was bad, due to trauma.
          </p>
          <p>
           Given that

            Quinn has been exposed for lying during a Congressional briefing

          </p>

           Yet it's undeniable Quinn lied in order to obtain and then extend an unconstitutional restraining order.

          <p>
           We now see why rights matters. Cross-examination allows liars to be exposed.

           SupposedlyÂ Lifschitz was some sort of go-getter trying to make his way in the world rather than a Sometime Awful troll.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a lie.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Alex has a trust fund. In addition to that,Â Lifschitz has never lived in an apartment under his own name.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Quinn, when lying before Congress about me, admitted she and Lifschitz lived together in Seattle.
          </p>
          <p>
           While I won't give outÂ Lifschitz's prior address, I will tell you two things about it:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It's in Beverly Hills.
           </li>
           <li>
            It's in daddy's and step mommy's name.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           You read that correctly. Mr.Â Lifschitz did not ask daddy or mommy to co-sign for a rental property that he paid rent on. He lived in style, in the most exclusive zip code in Southern California, for free.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before living in that Beverly Hills home,Â Lifschitz lived in the following property:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            It's in Beverly Hills.
           </li>
           <li>
            It's in mommy's name.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           As with the above property,Â Lifschitz lived rent free.
          </p>
          <p>
           I will gladly make my investigations into Quinn andÂ Lifschitz available to verified journalists to confirm what I say here is true.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Long before GamerGate, Alex Lifschitz was aÂ patheticÂ loser living off of mommy and daddy.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           GamerGate didn't ruin his life. He had no life. He's a former Internet troll turned scammer, just like his lover Zoe Quinn.

           GamerGate is a consumer revolt against unethical journalism with many allies, especially pro-free speech and anti-censorship allies like myself.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some have accused me of "joining" GamerGate to get e-famous. That's sort of silly for a couple of reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
           First, I have an established track record of hating censorship. Go reach my archives back from 2004 and ask yourself what my opinion is on censorship. It hasn't changed. I oppose it and will spend my own money to fight it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Second, I was already e-famous. Crime &amp; Federalism, back when it was a seriously legal blog, was widely read.
           <a href="http://www.dangerandplay.com/2014/07/27/trust-im-lawyer/" target="_blank">
            I've been cited in federal court opinions and law reviews
           </a>
           . Haters gonna hate, but yeah, people know me.
          </p>
          <p>
           I've been recognized in cafes worldwide and can hold a meet-up in any city in the world and have people show up. No one says, "Are you Mike from GamerGate?!" They have all said, "
           <a href="http://www.dangerandplay.com/" target="_blank">
            Are you Mike from Danger &amp; Play?
           </a>
           "
          </p>
          <p>
           I didn't need GamerGate to get e-famous, and if anything it has a poor ROI for my primary businesses. I teach mindset techniques, have a mindset book coming out, and sell juicing books. I don't see a massive intersection between gamers and mindset training and green juicing, but if sales data proves me wrong, I'll gladly eat my words.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            GamerGate is massive. Some data analysis shows 250,000 people have posted to the hashtag.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't have the Big Data on GamerGate, but I do have my own data. And I'm happy to share it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's look at my growth in Twitter followers. Keep in mind I'm highly controversial. I even post deliberately shocking and outrageous tweets, because that's sort of fun.
          </p>
          <p>
           Actually, I post the shocking tweets because my book is called
           <em>
            Gorilla Mindset
           </em>
           . If a few tweets make you cry, you're not going to read or apply my mindset techniques. So...Good riddance.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thus, I'm a niche "name" in GamerGate. People who are into self-improvement and dark humor enjoy me. The rest...not so much.
          </p>
          <p>
           Most people in GamerGate find my humor to be a bit too gallows-based, and that's cool. Celebrate diversity!
          </p>
          <p>
           On net I've gained around 10,000 followers via my pro-#GamerGate position. I consistently gained 500 new followers a month before GamerGate, so it's hard to say for sure how many of my new Twitter followers are from GamerGate. But I'm comfortable with saying it's 10,000 or so.
          </p>
          <p>
           I currently have around 24,000 Twitter followers. Many of those are fake, as SJWs bought me fake followers in an effort to get me in trouble with Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
           My best guess is 15,000 of my Twitter followers are real.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">

            Here's my GamerGate data.

          </p>
          <p>
           In September, I thought GamerGate was sort of stupid, as I didn't understand it. I didn't start posting earnestly to the GamerGate hashtag until October. I stopped posting to the hashtag often in December or so, although I do still post about GamerGate.

           I've included my Analytics page from Twitter. The analytics will give you a sense of how many people are in GamerGate.

          <p>
           Last year when adult film actress Mercedes Carrera threw in her voice for #GamerGate, I groaned a little. I viewed her with suspicion. Did she really believe in free speech, or was she another nit-wit trying to get Internet famous?
          </p>
          <p>
           As the months passed, I observed her conduct, watched her interviews, and even got to talk to her a few times. She is everything women who oppose #GamerGate are not. She is thoughtful, intelligent, and fiercely independent. I have never been so happy to admit I was wrong about a person.
          </p>
          <p>
           While involved in #GamerGate, someone named
           <a href="http://www.dangerandplay.com/2015/04/30/chris-kluwe-what-happened-to-him/" target="_blank">
            Chris Kluwe
           </a>
           , who I'm told is a former pro NFL player, started bullying gamers. He developed a creepy obsession with me, and to this day constantly references my genitals.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://federalism.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf6e653ef01b8d1107329970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false">

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Kluwe was everything I am not. He's a dumb jock, and after he realized how many people read my articles and listen to my podcast, he tried getting Internet famous by attacking me.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Enter the Kluwe-Cernovich "Debate."
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Chris Kluwe and I agreed to a debate. I knew Kluwe had intended to troll me, as he refused to have a moderator like the GamerGate neutral David Pakman moderate the debate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Going in my strategy was simple, "Do not play a game of 'Who can be the bigger asshole?'" I would let Chris be an asshole, so that those who watched the video could see with their own eyes
           <a href="http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2015/04/why-are-people-opposing-gamergate-evil-9-sjws-who-are-horrible-people.html" target="_blank">
            people who oppose GamerGate are terrible people
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           In our "debate," Kluwe was smug, dismissive, and rather insufferable. By design. My guys were really pissed at me, as they believed I looked beta.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet it was part of a broader plan. After the debate I posted how I let Kluwe look like a huge asshole. Even his die-hard supporters were left saying, "Cernovich is an idiot, but Kluwe did our side no favors."
          </p>
          <p>
           Kluwe didn't sleep for 36 hour after the debate, as the name-searched himself endlessly for validation. Meanwhile, I slept like a baby, knowing Kluwe was going to destroyed soon enough.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Kluwe walks into the trap.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The claim has been made that GamerGate is a woman-hating movement. How could we prove it's actually people who oppose GamerGate who hate women?
          </p>
          <p>
           My plan was to taunt Kluwe to his breaking point, get him to loudly challenge me to a debate, and then bring in my ringer.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            "Mike Cernovich hides behindÂ Mercedes Carrera."
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           When Kluwe challenged me to a debate, David Pakman was quick to offer to moderate it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such a debate is against the spirt of GamerGate, which is inclusive. Yeah, let's have three white men in their 30s talk about whether GamerGate is a misogynistic hate movement. Hello irony!
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://cernovich.com/mike-cernovichs-websites/" target="_blank">
            I have enough media platforms to mouth off on
           </a>
           . I'd much rather hear from pro-GamerGate voices like Ms. Carrera.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mercedes is highly intelligent and extroverted. Once Kluwe ran his mouth off again, I'd offer to have MercedesÂ step in.
          </p>
          <p>
           I knew three things would happen.
          </p>
          <p>
           First, Kluwe wouldÂ make some sexist bullshit remark about me âhiding behind a woman.â Kluwe did not disappoint.
          </p>

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           He did indeed make a sexist remark about Mercedes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kluwe also refused to debateÂ Mercedes, believing women should have men speak for them rather than speak for themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           I pushed the issue, as it's wrong for me to purport to speak for women like Mercedes. She is strong and smart enough to stand her own ground and speak her own mind.

           Second, I knew Kluwe would treat Mercedes with utter disdain in a debate. He did not disappoint.
          </p>
          <p>
           Chris didn't wash his clothes, comb his hair, or even listen to Mercedes. The debate was a debacle for Kluwe.
          </p>
          <p>
           He attempted to bully her, like the pig he is.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rather than address her with respect, which should be done regardless of the gender of your opponent, he threw tantrums, lied, and mocked Mercedes.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://federalism.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf6e653ef01b7c786f46e970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false">

          </p>
          <p>
           Third, I knew Mercedes would destroy Kluwe, which she did.
          </p>
          <p>
           I've spoken with her enough to know how smart she is. Underestimate Mercedes at your own risk.
          </p>
          <p>
           Chris looked terrible. Watch this video to see a sexist pig get spit roasted.

           Zoe Quinn is being heralded as a helpless victim of the Internet's hate machine. Indeed,Â Katherine Clark,Â a Congressional representative for 5th District of Massachusetts, helped Ms. Quinn lie in front of Congress. Yet there's an untold story about Ms. Quinn.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm a biased story teller, as I'm the person Zoe Quinn doxed, harassed, and tried having Swatted. Ms. Quinn also lied about me to Congress.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I'm also a lawyer who understands you, the reader, want evidence for every assertion I make. Thus,Â I'll share the evidence so you may decide for yourself sort of person Zoe QuinnÂ is:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            She was a member of helldump, a doxing and Swatting board on Something Awful.
           </li>
           <li>
            She was caught lying about her involvement with helldump.
           </li>
           <li>
            She doxed and attempted toÂ Swat me.
           </li>
           <li>
            She posted online threats against herself on 4Chan.
           </li>
           <li>
            She lied in a Congressional briefing.
           </li>
          </ul>

             What is the truth about Zoe Quinn?

           <strong>
            Zoe Quinn was a member of helldump, a doxing and Swatting message board on Something Awful.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Zoe Quinn was an active participant at helldump, a doxing and Swatting board on Something Awful. At helldump people with a mean streak would Â form online hate mobs to terrorize and harass their targets. They took pride in having a confirmed kill.
          </p>
          <p>
           Helldump members bullied a teenage "furry" into committing suicide. (A "furry" is a member of a subculture who dresses up in animal costumes. It's a little weird, but nothing criminal and certainly not conduct worthy of being bullied to suicide.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Quinn called her participation in helldump a "crippling addiction," and pondered how she missed it.
          </p>

          <p>
           Perhaps Ms. Quinn regrets her former online conduct. If so, she should own up and admit to it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rather than address criticisms against her, Ms. Quinn has chosen to lie about her considerable history as an online harasser.

            Zoe Quinn now falsely claims she was never a member of helldump.

          </p>
          <p>
           After being heralded in the media as a victim of online harassment rather than a troll who has harassed people online for years, Ms. Quinn claims she was never a member of helldump.

          </p>
          <p>
           As you can see, above, Zoe Quinn was a helldump member. No one has made anything up. She is lying. End of story.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            Zoe Quinn continues to harass people online.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Zoe Quinn personally doxed and attempted to SWAT me. As with her proven involvement with helldump, Ms. Quinn claims she never doxed me or attempted to have me Swatted.
          </p>
          <p>
           The evidence against Ms. Quinn is overwhelming, indeed the evidence against Ms. Quinn comes from her own Twitter account.
          </p>
          <p>
           1. Margaret Pless published an article listing my home address and containing a picture that was taken outside of my home. (I've since moved.)

           3. Zoe Quinn Tweeted out a link to her over 30,000 Twitter followers immediately after the article was published (

           <strong>
            That's as open-and-shut example of a doxing case as it gets, isn't it?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Now it's true I'm a licensed attorney in California. As such I will always have to post my address online.
          </p>
          <p>
           One might therefore claim my "dox" is fair game.
          </p>
          <p>
           If all publicly available information can be posted online, then it doesn't make much sense to call out doxing. Who cares, right?
          </p>
          <p>
           In my view, doxing in itself isn't bad. Who cares if people know where I live, right?
          </p>
          <p>
           However,Â Zoe Quinn posted my information online in an attempt to incite her Twitter followers, who she had known from Something Awful and helldump, to SWAT me.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know Ms. Quinn wanted to SWAT me as she and her friend

           Considering Ms. Quinn widely disseminated an article containing my home address as well as pictures on my home to her over 30,000 Twitter followers, one needn't be a rocket science to conclude helldump is exactly the sort of place Quinn would call home.

            Has Zoe Quinn been threatened or are the threats against her hoaxes?

          </p>
          <p>
           Since we know Ms. Quinn has a history of trolling and threatening others online, it's not a stretch to wonder if any of the death threats that have allegedly been made against Quinn were made by herself.
          </p>
          <p>
           It appears Ms. Quinn was once caught red-handed (or in this case middle-fingered) threatening herself. Unfortunately there is no Archive link.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 4Chan, a board Ms. Quinn has admittedly posted to, this threat was made against her.

           In this image you see something fascinating. Whoever made that threat against Ms. Quinn was also logged into Quinn's Twitter account.

           As Quinn never claimed to be hacked, it's clear she was trolling for attention on 4Chan.
          </p>
          <p>
           That said, some may claim the image was photoshopped. Unfortunately the image was removed from 4Chan, although the post it referenced is
           <a href="https://archive.moe/v/thread/261304419/#261307504" target="_blank">
            available via Archive

           . (If an Archive link of the picture is made available, I will link to it.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Given Quinn's considerable history as a troll, it's not hard to imagine her making death threat hoaxes for attention.
          </p>
          <p>
           Moreover, Ms. Quinn earns her living as a professional victim. She has a Patreon account, which she links to whenever a "death threat" against her is made.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ms. Quinn is a professional troll rather than professional victim, as it appears she earns money by posting threats against herself.

            Zoe Quinn takes her lies to Congress.

          </p>
          <p>
           As a guest ofÂ Congresswoman Katherine Clark, Zoe Quinn appeared for a Congressional briefing. (A briefing can be set up by paying $3,000 a corporation like RAND.)

           During this hearing,

            Ms. Quinn testified (presumably under oath)
           </a>
           :
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "There's actually a cottage industry of people who contribute nothing but hatred of marginalized people who make their living off of being its figureheads and telling them all where to go next. One of them decided it was wise to hire a [private investigator] to stalk my physical location and report back to them, thus making sure I would never go home again."
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Quinn later revealed I (Mike Cernovich) was this lawyer who hired a PI to stalk her. I never revealed Quinn's address or "stalked her."
          </p>
          <p>
           However, as you can see, I hired a private investigator to figure out who Quinn was after she doxed and attempted to Swat me.
          </p>
          <p>
           It appears hiring a PI was a prudent move, as Quinn is a sociopath.

          <p>
           If Representative Katherine Clark wants to continue letting Zoe Quinn lie to Congress, that's an issue for her political opponents to point out.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the media wants to present Zoe Quinn as the face of online harassment, as a victim rather than perpetrator, then you now know to distrust the media.

           If you're ever going to write about free speech on the Internet, expect a lot of bizarre behavior. Be prepared for lies. People will lie about you and then lie about ever having lied about you after they are exposed.

           For example, a bunch of people including Daily Kos intern Margaret Pless and her friend Zoe Quinn called the Los Angeles Police Department on me and encouraged others to do the same.

           In fact I have never been contacted by the LAPD, as the complaints were frivolous.
          </p>
          <p>
           Margaret Pless of Daily Kos now claims she never reported me to the Los Angeles Police Department. As I'm a lawyer, I archive everything to preserve evidence.

           In this article, Ms. Pless gives her readers detailed instructions on the proper way to file a police report. She even included my eye color and a high resolution photograph of my baby blues:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            You can file a police report over the web with the anonymous tip tool I found on the LAPDâs website.Â Itâs quite detailed, so if youâre not sure what color Cernovichâs eyes are youâre welcome to look at my answers or this high-resolution photo of him
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Ms. Pless called the cops on me because of my free speech. She concedes this point as her article notes,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            P.S. You can add an image to each complaint you file. I recommend any of these Mike Cernovich tweets.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Ms. Pless' article concludes:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            To report Cernovichâs threats to his local police department, please click here or go to http://lacrimestoppers.com/ and click the âGive a Tipâ link on the left. You do not have to give your name to submit a tip.

          <p>
           In what world is writing an article entitled, "How to Report Mike Cernovich to the LAPD w/o a Single Deadlift," which instructs readers how to "report Cernovich to his local police department" not calling the police on someone?

          </span>
         </h5>
         <div class="entry-body font-entrybody">
          <p>
           David Pakman runs a broadcast radio and TV show, and also hosts aÂ YouTube news and commentary site. Known for being hard-hitting, Pakman Â thoroughly researches his guests. Before a guest appears on his program, Pakman solicits Twitter for feedback, essentially crowdsourcing his research. Pakman is so thorough that he recently had a guest on to talk about #GamerGate. Pakman confronted this guest with blog posts from over 10 years ago!
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet it appears Pakman has different rules for different guests.
          </p>
          <p>
           Recently Pakman had Chris Kluwe, a former NFL player, on his show. Kluwe is one of those moralists we all know and love. They attempt to throwing lighting bolts down on sinners, when a closer examination reveals they themselves are the biggest sinners.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            What did Chris Kluwe know about "underage girls" in "compromising situations"?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, Chris Kluwe posted on Twitter that "underage girls" were caught in a "compromising situation" with two Vikings players. Kluwe contined, "Bet you didn't hear about that one in the news. We can do this all day, Vikings. Special teams hears *everything*." Read more, "
           <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/general/writer/gregg-doyel/24628550/chris-kluwe-cant-be-moral-crusader-after-his-cruel-twitter-rant" target="_blank">
            Chris Kluwe Can't Be Moral Crusader After Cruel Twitter Rant
           </a>
           ."
          </p>
          <p>
           Why didn't we "hear about that one in the news"? That would have been a great question to ask Kluwe!
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Did Chris Kluwe joke about child rape victims, and if so, why?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           According to news reports, "Kluwe used the Sandusky horror in Penn State as the set-up to his joke, which was to walk around the locker room with a hole ripped out of his pants -- in the back, near his rectum -- and said he was a 'Penn State victim.'"
          </p>
          <p>
           Kluwe seemed to confirm the reports were true, posting on his Twitter, "Over half the team did it for over a month, including asking him if he 'raped any little boys lately,' repeatedly, in front of coaches."
          </p>
          <p>
           I guess that makes it OK?
          </p>
          <p>
           Why didn't David Pakman ask Chris Kluwe about the alleged child rape jokes?
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            It appears that certain questions were off-limits, as Pakman refused to ask Kluwe about two highly controversial and interesting issues.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           How can we know Pakman agreed to not ask certain questions of Chris Kluwe?
          </p>
          <p>
           The big reason we know Pakman agreed to refrain from asking certain subjects is becauseÂ Kluwe signed a non-disclosure agreement with the Vikings. Under this agreement, Kluwe is not allowed to answer these questions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kluwe could not have done the interview unless Pakman agreed to treat these questions as being off limits.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Chris Kluwe threatened to sue me.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Unlike David Pakman, I did not agree to refuse to ask Kluwe hard questions. When I asked him about his failure to report what I interpreted as a rape, he threatened to sue me.
          </p>
          <p>
           I laughed pretty hard.Â As Kluwe lives in California, the lawsuit would be struck down under California's very protective anti-SLAPP law.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kluwe would pay my legal fees while giving me millions in free publicity, as the lawsuit would be international news.
          </p>
          <p>
           Why didn't David Pakman ask Chris Kluwe about lawsuit threats made against me?
          </p>
          <p>
           Again, he couldn't.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            David Pakman's white lies add up.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           After I confronted Pakman with my allegations, he claimed to not know who I am.
          </p>
          <p>
           That's sort of silly, since Pakman has covered
           <a href="http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2015/04/what-is-gamergate.html" target="_blank">
            #GamerGate
           </a>
           extensively and I have been accused of being a central figure in #GamerGate. Although this is incorrect, my involvement in #GamerGate has been mentioned on MSNBC, Gawker, Newsweek, Boing Boing too many other sites to keep track of
          </p>
          <p>
           However, Pakman had invited me to be on a guest on his show.

            Is David Pakman a journalistic fraud?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Having on a guest and refusing to ask certain hard questions, without disclosing this to viewers, would strike me as highly unethical.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lying about agreeing to keep certain topics off limits would also be unethical, and in my view fraud.
          </p>
          <p>
           Pretending not to know who someone you invited on your show as a guest could be faulty memory.
          </p>
          <p>
           We all make mistakes, and I hope David Pakman owns up to his mistakes, apologizes to his viewers, and moves on stronger than ever.

           Another day, another drama. Zoe Quinn recently appeared before some staffers in Congress to lie about me. Luckily for me I am not under an unconstitutional gag order and thus can respond to these lies and misrepresentations.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is what Ms. Quinn testified to under oath:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "There's actually a cottage industry of people who contribute nothing but hatred of marginalized people who make their living off of being its figureheads and telling them all where to go next. One of them decided it was wise to hire a [private investigator] to stalk my physical location and report back to them, thus making sure I would never go home again."
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Ms. Quinn's lover,Â Alex Lifschitz, revealed I was the lawyer Ms. Quinn was referencing. Let's tell this story once more.
          </p>

           1. ZoeÂ Quinn posted
           <strong>
            my home address as well as pictures taken outside of my home
           </strong>
           to her more than 30,000 Twitter followers. The "best GG journalism" article Quinn references was a full dox of me provided by Daily Kos intern and Something Awful "goon" Margaret Pless.

           2.Â Zoe Quinn previously belonged to a forum on Something Awful called Helldump.Â Helldump was a cyber bullying board that had a "confirmed kill," that is, they were able to bully a teenager into suicide.

           I was not worried about being "bullied" or anything, but I was concerned with SWATting.
           <a href="http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2014/12/margaret-pless-zoe-quinn.html" target="_blank">
            SWATting is when goons from Something Awful
           </a>
           call in a 9-1-1 emergency to get a laugh or to silence and intimidate their political opponents.
          </p>
          <p>
           SWATting is attempted murder, as their aim was to get me shot by a SWAT team.
          </p>
          <p>
           After Quinn posted my address as well as pictures that were taken outside of my home to her more than 30,000 Twitter followers, which included her friends from Something Awful's Helldump board, I left my apartment for a hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
           3. I posted on Twitter that Ms. Quinn had a chance to explain herself. I asked for an apology.
          </p>
          <p>
           4. Instead Quinn gloated at being able to drive me from my home.
          </p>
          <p>
           5. I hired a private investigator to conduct a risk assessment of Ms. Quinn, her lover Alex Lifschitz, and Daily Kos intern Margaret Pless.
          </p>
          <p>
           6. Ms. Quinn's assertion that I've stalked her Boston home is a lie. I in fact know her current address in Seattle, and I have no interest in conducting a follow-up investigation, as Ms. Quinn has been relatively well-behaved after it was reported a hacker had obtained a copy of her hard drive.
          </p>
          <p>
           7. If you believe anything Zoe Quinn says, you're a gullible fool. If you share her testimony, you are spreading perjury.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, Quinn is such a pathological liar that she now claims she was never a member of Helldump.

          </p>
          <p>
           By the way, harassment does not mean hurting my feelings. Harassment means doxing and attempting to SWAT me.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can talk trash online with the best of them, and would never complain about fair criticism.
          </p>
          <p>
           Trying to have me SWATted, as Ms. Quinn sought to do, crosses the line. That seems like such a dull point to make, and yet no media outlet has reported about Zoe Quinn's dox of me.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lying under oath, which Ms. Quinn has done, also deserves more attention. That also seems very duh, but it appears we live in a world of gullible fools - or worse, outright liars and gutless hypocrites.

           throw around the world censorship, lawyers tend to lose their marbles. "Censorship is something only the government can do!"
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't get why lawyers (I happen to be one, too) get all pissy when non-lawyers use the wrong terms. Law is complicated. Hell, while I'm well-versed on the First Amendment, I even have a First Amendment lawyer to represent me. Who can keep track of it all?
          </p>
          <p>
           I would be curious, though, to know whether the Charlie Hebdo murders were an example of censorship. Those murders weren't state-sponsored, after all...
          </p>
          <p>
           Incidentally, the same lawyers who froth at the mouth over the vernacular abuse of the poor word censorship will say, "I plead the Fifth." No one says, "You dummies! You can only plead the fifth when you're in an official proceeding where the government seeks to compel you to incriminate yourself!"
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            We get it. There's "censorship" and censorship.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           There's the sort of "censorship" we all do. I don't post everything that pops in my head. I have some discretion, believe it or not. I self-censor.
          </p>
          <p>
           There has been a lot of "censorship" surrounding #GamerGate. Forums that were previously open to vigorous debate and discussed deleted tens-of-thousands of posts on a single subject.
          </p>
          <p>
           Reddit (which has message boards like "Chimp Out" that shock even me) banned discussion of #GamerGate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, that's "censorship." It's well within the rights of Reddit to "censor," but it is "censorship."
          </p>
          <p>
           And I don't care.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            I don't care about "censorship."
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           A lot of pro-#GamerGate people tell me about the latest "censorship" going on. They are nice people, and I feel a bit rude saying it, but my general response is, "I don't care. Private parties may do what they please."
          </p>
          <p>
           Twitter may ban me any day, as is their prerogative. It'd be a stupid move, as playing political favorites would only inspire competitors to create alternatives, but it'd be a stupid move well within Twitter's rights.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           <strong>
            I don't even have any problems with the block bots. Wait, you don't know what blockbots are?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Some people decided to create a program that would allow users to automatically block anyone who followed me on Twitter. If you're a lawyer who has never heard of #GamerGate and you follow me on Twitter,
           <em>
            your account
           </em>
           will be blocked by thousands of people.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's guilt-by-association. You're a bad person because you may find what I post interesting. (Half of the people who follow me on Twitter don't agree with me; they simply enjoy a compelling spectacle.)
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/03/20/bbc-featured-block-bot-runs-into-legal-trouble/" target="_blank">
            There's even a blockbot based on Richard Dawkins
           </a>
           , the preeminent scientist who has managed to offend the same young people who "fucking love science." I know, the cognitive dissonance astounds.
          </p>
          <p>
           The blockbot is "censorship," in that it prevents thousands of people from being heard. And it's "censorship" I don't give a fuck about.
          </p>

           I have been reported to the California State Bar for my free speech. Is trying to get the government to punish me for my speech censorship?

           But since it's happened to a straight white man, no one cares.
