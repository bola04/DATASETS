         The purpose of the Beer Judge Certification Program is to:
         <ul>
          <li>
           Encourage knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the world's diverse beer, mead, and cider styles;
          </li>
          <li>
           Promote, recognize, and advance beer, mead, and cider tasting, evaluation, and communication skills; and
          </li>
          <li>
           Develop standardized tools, methods, and processes for the structured evaluation, ranking and feedback of beer, mead, and cider.
          </li>
         </ul>
         We certify and rank beer judges through an examination and monitoring process, sanction competitions, and provide educational resources for current and future judges.

         Website Migration In Progress
        </h3>
        <p>
         The BJCP website migration is currently in progress, as many of you have no doubt noticed. We are posting new content on the new website first, and are migrating our legacy content right now. This is not a simple moving of files; all documents and data are being reviewed and refreshed as they are moved. New content is also being added. For content that has been fully migrated, we have placed links on the current website pointing to the new website.
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that it may be a little confusing to see material in two locations, so we ask for your patience during this transition. Once we have completed the move, the new server will be renamed to be www.bjcp.org; the temporary links to dev.bjcp.org will be updated, so don't make long-term links to that content.
        </p>
        <p>
         News stories are being posted to the new site, so please check there for revised content or use this
         <a href="http://dev.bjcp.org/communications/news/">
          direct link
         </a>
         . As readers of our newsletter know, we are starting the 2017 election season so please check that story for all the details. We are also preparing for improvements to the exam calendar, so those registering exams will now be asked for exact dates for exams as well as the location.
        </p>
        <p>
         Expect more changes to the new website as the migration continues and we optimize our content. The changes we are making should make our content easier to maintain, more consistent and accurate, and better able to support our planned expansions. Thanks again for your patience and support as we complete this large and complex project.

         Grader Training Program Launched
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Exam and Education Directorates are very pleased to announce the release of the inaugural offering of the Grader Training Program. The Beer Judging Exam Grader Training is a joint effort aimed at exposing new graders to a trial exercise ahead of grading their first set of exams, as well as provide existing graders with an opportunity to re-calibrate. These are self-paced courses that are available on the new BJCP Continuing Education Portal. Anyone who is a has a rank of National or higher will automatically be granted access to these courses.

         Update on BJCP Exams and Competitions in China
        </h3>
        <p>
         We are pleased to announce that the first BJCP-registered competition was held in Shanghai on May 28th, 2016.   The first of two BJCP Beer Judging exams will be held in Beijing on September 17, 2016, followed by one in Shanghai in May, 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
         The BJCP is working with the homebrewing and craft brewing communities in China to assist in the registration of competitions, which can be done online by any organization.   Organizers have the right to run their competitions as they see fit, consistent with these
         <a href="rules.php">
          rules
         </a>
         . Organizers have wide latitude to create a unique competition experience. The BJCP Competition Handbook provides good guidance and advice, but it is not binding.  Registration of the competition ensures that the experience points earned by the judges are recorded and credited towards their advancement within the judging program.  The BJCP plays a passive role in the competition registration and has no involvement in choosing the date of the competition or determining whether the entries will be homebrewed or commercial beers.
        </p>
        <p>
         BJCP Beer Judging exams anywhere in the world may be scheduled by any groups of participants that meet the criteria specified on our
         <a href="examschproc.php">
          website
         </a>
         for having an exam.  These criteria include having at least ten examinees who are currently BJCP judges or who have passed the online Beer Entrance Exam, and we also require that the local exam administrator work with the exam directors to ensure that the exam is scheduled on a date when qualified proctors are available to travel to the city where the exam will be held.  The examinees in China may write the scoresheets in Mandarin, English, Spanish or Portuguese, but exams written in languages other than English will be translated for the graders.  This extra step typically does add more than 30 days to timeline for completing the grading and processing the results.
        </p>
        <p>
         We look forward to continued collaboration with the brewing community in China to help them improve their understanding and awareness of beer styles and provide a path on which they can become certified beer judges!

         2015 Online Entrance Exam is Live
        </h3>
        <p>
         Exam Director Scott Bickham just announced that the online entrance exam (at
         <a href="http://bjcp.coursewebs.com">
          bjcp.coursewebs.com
         </a>
         ) has been updated to cover the 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines (don't worry, you can still test against the 2008 Guidelines for the rest of this year), and also provided a new status update on the revision process discussed last month:
        </p>
        <p>
         The English version BJCP entrance exam is now available in versions based on the 2008 and 2015 Style Guidelines. The Spanish and Portuguese versions will follow in a few months after the volunteers who are translating the style guidelines can turn their attention to the 3400 questions that feed into each 200 question exam. The exam based on the 2008 guidelines will be available until the end of the year, after which all Beer Judging exams will be based on the 2015 Style Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new questions were written to better closely match the style descriptions, and the grammar and punctuation errors were cleaned up to improve the readability and to make them easier to translated into other languages. A number of problem questions with either incorrect or ambiguous answers were either corrected or removed, so this should provide additional incentives to take the 2015 version of the BJCP Entrance exam. As noted in the previous update, questions on three historical styles (Roggenbier, London Brown Ale and Pre-Prohibition Lager) were removed, but new questions were added on styles in the European Sour Beer Category. The styles tested on the exam come from Categories 1-26; however there are currently no questions on the Specialty IPA since these styles have not yet proliferated to some parts of the US let alone our international judging community. We will add questions on these styles at some point, but will post a message on our website communicating the date when the new questions will be integrated into the exam.

         The long-awaited 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines are now complete, and have been released for use. There are now separate documents for Beer, Mead, and Cider styles, which allows them to be updated in the future on different schedules. The documents are currently available in PDF and Word formats from the
         <a href="stylecenter.php">
          Style Center

        <p>
         BJCP exams will begin to use the 2015 guidelines on exams given in November 2015. More information will be posted as it is available. Tests prior to 1 November 2015 will be based on the 2008 guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
         BJCP-sanctioned competitions may use either set of guidelines. Check with individual competition organizers for specific rules. The BJCP expects that by the end of 2015, all competitions will use the 2015 guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
         Note that most style-related documents and information posted refers to the 2008 guidelines. As additional formats and translations are available, we will note that in the Style Center.

         Change in Sensory Kits
        </h3>
        <p>
         There will be a major change with sensory kit orders placed on or after April 1, 2015. We are discontinuing purchase of the 24 vial comprehensive kit and will now only offer a 12 vial basic kit.  Two main factors have led to this change.  One, we received feedback that many of the vials in the Siebel comprehensive kit are going unused due to the obscure nature of the characteristic.  The second is that Siebel has changed their vendor and is now allowing custom kits to be built.  After much discussion, we have determined that a basic 12 vial custom kit is our best choice at this time for both exam prep classes and member training.  The new custom kit will consist of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Acetaldehyde
         </li>
         <li>
          Butyric
         </li>
         <li>
          Diacetyl
         </li>
         <li>
          DMS
         </li>
         <li>
          Earthy
         </li>
         <li>
          Ethyl Acetate
         </li>
         <li>
          Ethyl Hexanoate
         </li>
         <li>
          Geraniol
         </li>
         <li>
          Indole
         </li>
         <li>
          Isovaleric
         </li>
         <li>
          Papery
         </li>
         <li>
          Spicy
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         When determining which characteristics to offer, we intentionally excluded those that can be easily reproduced at home. The CEP team will develop a flyer containing guidelines to supplement the Siebel kit that talks about what other faults class leaders should include in sensory training, and how to properly doctor those samples.  This will be done prior to the new kits being shipped.
        </p>
        <p>
         A more advanced 12 vial kit may be developed at a later time if demand and budget permit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The cost of the new style kit will remain the same, $50 for exam kits and $100 for member kits.  Shipping costs have increased due to an international vendor, and keeping the member cost the same will allow more members to purchase kits before the budget cap is reached each year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anyone wishing to purchase the comprehensive kit may still do so but will need to place that order directly with
         <a href="https://www.siebelinstitute.com/products-a-books/sensory-training-kits">
          Siebel
         </a>
         .  The BJCP will no longer subsidize this kit or be involved in the ordering process.

         Updates to Judge Portal and Exam Workflow
        </h3>
        <p>
         Since the NHC we've been hard at work to make some improvements to our services, and are now happy to announce their availability.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          We have updated the Judge Record application to display your judge certificate and your membership card. Both have been redesigned to use our latest logos and color schemes. Your membership card now also shows when you joined the program, and you can print any judge certificate you have earned, not just your latest rank.
         </li>
         <li>
          We have revised the name badge to use the new color scheme, to display any mead certification earned, and to have alternative attachment options (traditional clip, magnetic bar, plain card, or plain card with a lanyard).
         </li>
         <li>
          We have increased the automation of our exam processing workflow, and now are capturing the PDFs of your original exam and the RTPs produced by the graders. These files are also available on your judge record. We have loaded past RTPs back to 2010 into the system as well. Scanned exams are still being organized and will be uploaded later.
         </li>
         <li>
          We have implemented a new short form RTP for exams that have checkboxes for common problems and a free-format summary section. This should allow graders to complete the grading faster, and make the exams easier to review.
         </li>
         <li>
          Because we now have all these materials available through our self-service portal, we will stop mailing physical copies of RTPs, judge certificates, and membership cards. Pins and color guides will still be mailed. The self-service materials will be available much faster than the physical mailings; as soon as the results are uploaded to the server, email notices will be generated to examinees, and the data will be available.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         We are continuing to work on projects to improve the portal experience, to automate workflows, to reduce service times, and to refresh our materials. We are reorganizing and expanding content for our new web site, and hope to launch it later this year.

The major points are that the Apprentice rank is time-limited, and that those failing to progress to Recognized or above will be reclassified from Active status to Affiliated status. Affiliated judges have to start over in the exam program to become active, but keep their BJCP ID and past experience points.

         New Siebel Kit Pricing Structure
        </h3>
        <p>
         Due to an unprecedented demand for Siebel off-flavor kits driven by both a growth in the number of exams and in the demand for kits by members, a new pricing structure for kits has been adopted as of 22 April 2014. The subsidized price of kits for members has been raised from US$80 to US$100.	Kits for registered exam preparation classes are no longer free; the new price is US$50. The amount budgeted for the entire year was consumed by the end of March, so immediate action was required. Future price adjustments may be necessary depending on demand. The number of exams given has doubled since 2010 when the exam kits were introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequently, the board voted to increase 2014 funding for subsidized Siebel kits by US$10,000 from program reserves.

         Written Exam Fee Raised
        </h3>
        <p>
         Acting upon a recommendation from the Exam Directors, the board voted to raise fees for the Written Proficiency Exam from US$15 to US$25. This coincides with the rollout of a new
         <a href="docs/Quarterly_Exam.pdf">
          Quarterly Written Exam
         </a>
         that will allow multiple, geographically-dispersed sites to give written exams at the same time, and then combine them for grading purposes. The intent is to allow more written exams to be given without requiring a minimum number of examinees per site; this also frees up more slots for tasting exams on the exam calendar.

        <p>
         As announced at the BJCP Member's Meeting at the NHC, the backlog of exams has been cleared and new exams are being processed with an average turnaround time of 3 months. Because of this improvement in exam processing and the current availability of exam graders, the Exam Directors have decided to raise the limit on the number of exam sites per month from 8 to 10, starting in October 2013. We will continue to monitor exam turnaround and consider raising the limits further in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Exam Directors will be contacting existing exam sites to determine if any existing exams wish to move forward in the schedule. DO NOT CONTACT THE EXAM DIRECTORS. They will move through the schedule in an orderly manner. Once existing exams have been moved forward, any open slots will be shown on the Exam Calendar and likely noted in a web page announcement.

         Reminders for New Judges and Organizers
        </h3>
        <p>
         With the new exam program being introduced this year, there has been an increase in questions from new judges and organizers. Following are answers to these common questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Judges who pass the online exam are provisional judges but are not BJCP-ranked judges. They do not get assigned Judge IDs and may not yet request retroactive points.
         </li>
         <li>
          Provisional judges who judge in BJCP-sanctioned competitions should be treated by organizers as non-BJCP judges for reporting purposes. Report points by judge name.
         </li>
         <li>
          We scan for retroactive points when new judges take the initial tasting exam, and again when the exam results are posted. Do not request retroactive points before your exam results are received.
         </li>
         <li>
          Judge record updates are posted to the web site every four to six weeks. If you have received your exam results since the last time the web site was updated, do not ask about retroactive points. Wait for our normal processes to work. Check the main BJCP web page and look on the right side under "Check Your Record" to see when the last time the judge records were updated.
         </li>
         <li>
          If you are a judge who wants to claim retroactive points, first make sure your judge record is updated. Then make sure the organizer's report has been submitted for that competition. Check the Database Reports section of the web site for this information. When requesting points, provide the name, date and ID number of the competition in question.
         </li>
         <li>
          If you are an organizer who wants to change a previously-submitted organizer's report, simply email the changes to the IT Director. You cannot edit a report that has already been submitted. Just tell us what needs to be changed. Please provide the Competition ID. For changes to judge points, provide the Judge ID, the role performed, and the number of points to be awarded. Please be sure the points have been assigned in accordance with the competition point award schedule.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Following these simple procedures will allow the volunteer BJCP staff to focus their efforts on more productive work.

         Competition Registration Changes
        </h3>
        <p>
         BJCP competition registration processing has been streamlined to address common requests and has been updated based on how most competitions are currently run. We now provide a complete list of all active BJCP judges sorted by country, state, and name, rather than custom lists. Sort the file appropriately and use only those judges you need, or import it into competition management software. No label files and sign-in forms are included; you can create your own using mailmerge or competition management software. Evaluation forms can be downloaded from the competition center, if required. Finally, the free entry certificate for the AHA NHC competition is no longer included at the AHA's request; apparently very few were being used, and the competition is already over-subscribed. With over 400 competitions a year now being held, these changes have reduced processing time by over half from older methods.

          online
         </a>
         exam with 200 True-False and Multiple Choice questions that must be answered in one hour. Passing this exam allows judges to sign up for the new BJCP Beer Judging Examination, a practical tasting exam with 6 exam beers judged in 90 minutes. The score on this exam will allow a judge to be ranked as Apprentice, Recognized, or Certified.
        </p>
        <p>
         National judges and any judges who score 80 or higher on any tasting exam and have 10 judging experience points may register for the BJCP Beer Judge Written Proficiency Exam, which allows judges to advance to National and higher ranks. This new written exam will have 20 true-false questions and five essay questions that must be answered in 90 minutes. The new exams will be weighted 50/50 in determining an overall score for rank purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         New rules exist for current judges, so check the implementation guide carefully. Note that no current judges will have their ranks adjusted automatically, although current Apprentice judges have two years to become Recognized judges or have their judging status revoked.
        </p>
        <p>
         Quotas on exams remain in effect until the current exam backlog is cleared. The Exam Directors will then reassess the quota system and make necessary adjustments.

         New Exam Policies Announced
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Exam Directors, with the concurrence of the BJCP Board of Directors, have changed the policy regarding examinations being returned to examinees. The new policy authorizes Exam Administrators to make copies of the exams to return to the examinees once it is confirmed that the originals have been received by the BJCP.
         <i>
          This policy applies to new exams only (after August 15, 2010); older exams will not be returned.
         </i>
         <b>
          The BJCP will not make copies or return exams directly; it is the responsibility of the individual Exam Administrators.
         </b>
         Expenses are covered by the increased funding alloted to administrators earlier this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Exam Directors have also clarified the policy regarding exam proctors. Proctors must be
         <i>
          active
         </i>
         judges who are
         <i>
          currently
         </i>
         capable of producing National-level scoresheets. Exam administrators can find a
         <a href="apps/reports/proctors.php">
          list
         </a>
         of eligible proctors online. If the Exam Administrator is unable to find at least two proctors meeting these requirements, he
         <i>
          must
         </i>
         contact the Exam Directors to get advance approval to use alternative proctors. Certified-ranked judges who have scored at the National level on the tasting portion of the exam are usually acceptable, but must be pre-approved.

         Exam Scheduling Policy Updated Again
        </h3>
        <p>
         Effective immediately, the Exam Directors have changed the policy for scheduling BJCP exams. Up to 8 exam sites may now be registered per month (an increase from 5) but the total number of examinees per site is now limited to 12 (down from 20). This is an attempt to speed up the grading process by reducing the size of exam sets. Sites may request a larger quota (up to 20 examinees) but these must be pre-approved by the exam directors; more than one large site per month are unlikely to be approved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Registration lead-time for a 12 seat site remains at 4 months. A 20 seat site must be registered 6 months in advance. Larger sites may be approved for remote or unusual locations that may have limited resources for offering an exam. Contact the exam directors for details.

Two mead exams per month can be scheduled from July 2010 through November 2010, when restrictions on scheduling will be lifted. Note that mead exams count towards the existing five exams per month limit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, note that mead exams and beer exam types cannot be mixed at a single site. An exam registration can be for one or the other exam type, but not both. Multiple exam types per site are discouraged due to the five slot per month limit.

         The BJCP is happy to announce a partnership with the
         <a href="http://www.siebelinstitute.com/">
          Siebel Institute
         </a>
         to provide their new

          Sensory Training Kit
         </a>
         to BJCP exam prep classes. The Sensory Training Kit is a commercial product containing 24 different flavor samples, and replaces the prior kit which contained 10 samples.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new Siebel kit will be offered under the same terms as the previous kit: any CEP-registered exam prep class leading to a BJCP-registered exam can request a kit by contacting the
         <a href="mailto:education_director@bjcp.org">
          Education Director
         </a>
         . The kits are free, but shipping, duties, etc. involved in shipping outside the continental US will be charged at cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Education Director has contacted exam administrators and prep class organizers that have already been registered. Prep classes for exams already held in 2009 are eligible for receiving a kit, but must request one. Any organizer who did not receive a kit or who did not receive an email, please contact the
         <a href="mailto:education_director@bjcp.org">
          Education Director
         </a>

         Former BJCP President and Treasurer Sentenced
        </h3>
        <p>
         Former BJCP President and Treasurer William R. Slack of Nashua, NH was sentenced on December 16, 2008 in U.S. District Court in Concord, NH. Mr. Slack admitted his guilt as part of a plea bargain. During his allocution, Mr. Slack admitted that he misappropriated BJCP funds steadily during this tenure as BJCP Treasurer. Mr. Slack was sentenced to (1) restitution of approximately $43K, (2) five years probation, and (3) incarceration of one week per month for twelve months.

          As many members know, there has been an ongoing effort to deal with the failure of the former BJCP Treasurer, Mr. William R. Slack, of Nashua, New Hampshire, to turn over the funds in the treasury to the current Treasurer. Mr. Slack, also a former BJCP President, has not communicated with the current Board of Directors, and we have been pursuing a resolution of this matter since 2004.
