He is especially interested in how neural, biomechanical, behavioral and environmental influences interaction as infants learn to coordinate their early head, arm and leg behaviors for later skills such as reaching, sitting and walking. Dr. Galloway uses standard biomechanical tools and techniques (high speed motion capture, surface EMG, and multijoint equations of motion) as well as qualitative analysis of infants and their families in natural settings such as their homes. In addition to developmental psychology, his work draws from and has implications for neurophysiology, biomechanics, evolutionary biology, neurorehabilitation and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;",

He also is Associate Director of the Center for Autism Research at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The goal of his research is to improve the quality of care individuals with autism receive in their communities. This research is of two types. The first examines the effects of different state and federal strategies to organize, finance and deliver services on service use patterns and outcomes. The second consists of experimental studies designed to determine the best ways to successfully implement proven-efficacious practices in community settings. Dr. Mandell co-chaired the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Autism Task Force from 2003 to 2006 and consults with Philadelphia agencies to help them develop appropriate policies to meet the needs of people with autism. He currently serves as a member of the US Department of Health and Human Services Interagency Autism Coordinating Council.&lt;/p&gt;",

Dr. Rizzo researches the design, development and evaluation of Virtual Reality (VR) systems targeting the areas of clinical assessment, treatment and rehabilitation across psychological, cognitive and motor functioning in both healthy and clinical populations, including PTSD, TBI, Autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. The common thread that drives his work with digital technologies involves the study of how interactive and immersive VR simulations can be applied to address healthcare needs beyond what is possible with traditional tools and methods. Dr. Rizzo has received numerous awards, including the “American Psychological Association Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Practice of Trauma Psychology”, the “MMVR Satava Award” for excellence in the use of VR for therapeutic applications, and the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics “Pioneer in Medicine” award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAVE THE DATE: Gerard A.
