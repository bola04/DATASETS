      It will not come as a surprise to you that this site contains (short
and novel length) stories. We have created a number of categories in
this site, and are now looking for story writers who are willing to
share their stories (either fiction or non-fiction genre) with the
visitors of this site. Authors, if you have written a story or poem, by all means
use our site to publish your writing (short or novel length). Please add
to our collection of stories and poems.
      <p>
       Readers, story fans: if or want to read some free stories and/or poems,
this story archive is for you! Our collection of short stories and books
is growing nearly every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The site is separated into two sections. Please choose one of them below.
You can easily switch once you are in the site, so your choice is not
cast in stone!

       This section contains the "standard" stories (not specifically for young
readers). This can be a short story, a poem or a novel length story
(better called a book, really!). At this time we already have
hundreds of stories in this section for you to enjoy. But we are
always looking for more!
