     <h3>
      A Basic Overview
of Texas Hold'Em
     </h3>
     <p>
      Texas Hold'Em is a competitive poker game played in several
rounds where players bet to advance from one stage to the next. It is a game of
skill,
      <a href="/internet_strategies/">
       strategy
      </a>
      and, like all card games,
luck. The objective of Texas Hold'Em is very clear: have the best five-card poker
hand at the end of the game. Meeting the objective, however, is extremely challenging.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Texas Hold'Em, each player is dealt two private cards, and all players
share five community cards. Community cards are the X factor in Texas Hold'Em.
They are revealed slowly through three rounds of play called the Flop, the Turn
and the River. The challenge of Texas Hold'Em is for the player to determine which
cards will appear, how to use the cards, how other players will try to use the
cards, and the
      <a href="/odds/">
       odds
      </a>
      of winning with particular cards.
     </p>
     <p>
      In
Texas Hold'Em, players must take all of these factors into account when betting.
During every round, players choose to forfeit (fold), or to place bets to remain
in the game. Betting, however, can often be misleading. Players use bets not only
when they have a good
      <a href="/hands/">
       poker hand
      </a>
      , but sometimes to deceive
other players into thinking they have something that they don't.
     </p>
     <p>
      If this
all sounds complicated and exciting, you're right-it is. However, don't let that
discourage you. Here at The Poker Practice, we provide you with everything you
need to know about
