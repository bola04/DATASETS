          Don’t get too brilliant. Remember that humor is subjective. Exactly what is funny for other people could be plain to an additional– or worse offensive. Unless you are humor website, prevent making use of inexpensive stock images with a nod or wink as they can come off as supercilious or smarmy. Likewise, stay clear of anything that relies on popular culture recommendation as some readers could not recognize it. Plus, they can be outdated quick.
         </li>
