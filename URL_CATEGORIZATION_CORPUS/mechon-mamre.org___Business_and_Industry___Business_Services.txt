   Here you will find the Hebrew Bible (Tana"kh) and the RaMBaM's Complete Restatement of the Oral Law (Mishneh Torah):  Together these give God's full guidance for both Jews and Gentiles in all times and places detailing what God expects us to do and not do.  Through the study and observance of these two guides to Torah (God's instructions) we can all live richly rewarding lives and avoid painful errors.  Both our online and offline Bible and Mishneh Torah texts have been carefully prepared, and they are as accurate as found in the very finest printed editions.  (Additional materials are also provided, but they are not the heart of this site.)

   Since essentially all the content of this site is available in ZIPs, we ask that you not use a robot to download this whole site:  it is not only unnecessary, but costs us needless outlays for the added load on our server, makes the server slower for others who are online, and it would take years to read the whole site even for speed readers.

   If you have any questions or comments,
   <script type="text/javascript">

   We intend to answer all real (non-junk non-virus) mail within a day or two; so if you do not hear from us within three days, please write again assuming that either your letter or our answer has been lost, which is hardly rare these days.  Note that letters with attached programs that can be run (including scripts and Word DOCs) and letters with huge attachments are automatically rejected by our server; for security reasons, we only take text-based letters.  The hundreds of letters we get each month have helped us improve the site greatly, and we thank you for your on-going help:  God bless you all!
