       That's a good start, and there is plenty of information here
    about brainpower. But the brain is like computer hardware, and
    just like your computer needs software to make it useful, your
    brain needs a good mind to make it practical and powerful. So
    the pages here cover the brain and the mind.

         NLP

       </b>
       - September 7, 2014 - Neuro-linguistic programming
    is not as popular as it used to be, but that doesn't mean it
    has been invalidated. It's still worth looking at if you want
    to change your thinking and your life. The following is my own
    understanding of NLP, and an attempt to condense its most valuable
    insights and techniques into a few dozen paragraphs...

         Laugh

       </b>
       - Laughter releases endorphins and lowers
    stress levels, which is good for your brain. It's easier to concentrate
    when you are not stressed out. Humor also tends to leave you
    more open to new ideas and perspectives. Perhaps it's not a coincidence
    that Albert Einstein and other intelligent people have been known
    to have a good sense of humor.

         Calorie Restriction for a Healthy Brain
        </i>
       </b>
       - Many
    studies have demonstrated that a calorie-restricted diet leads
    to a longer life by decreasing the risk of heart disease, cancer,
    and stroke from obesity. The latest research shows that calorie
    restriction also helps increase the production of nerve growth
    factors, which are helpful to your brain.
