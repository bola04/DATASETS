      The TRADITIO Network Reaches Its 29,000,000th Reader - 06/09/18
     </h4>
     <b>
      On June 9, 2018, the Feast of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, in the 24th year of its apostolate on the internet, the TRADITIO Network logged its 29,000,000th reader.  TRADITIO was the first traditional Roman Catholic site to appear on the World Wide Web and was founded on the Feastday of St. Michael the Archangel, September 29, 1994.  We were here even before Newvatican was, even before Amazon.com was!
     </b>
     <br/>
     We thank the Lord for our over 29,000,000 readers over these years and for our hundreds of dedicated correspondents from all over the world, who keep us current on everything going on in the bowels of Newvatican, in the inner sancta of various traditional organizations, and at Traditional Latin Mass sites around the world.
     <b>
      TRADITIO has been the longest-existing and most read traditional Roman Catholic web site on the World Wide Web.
     </b>
     <br/>
     In their Daily Commentaries, the TRADITIO Fathers do not just copy news reports or the uninformed notions of johnny-come-lately "bloggers" in secular and religious publications, particularly Neocons and pseudo-traditionalists associated with the anti-Catholic Newchurch, who in fact have very little background or understanding of the Traditional Catholic Movement.  Nor is TRADITIO Network enslaved to any particular organization's viewpoint.
     <b>
      Instead, the TRADITIO Network provides the hard-hitting, independent analysis and perspective of over half a century of Roman Catholic experience, even from before Vatican II.
     </b>
     <br/>
     The TRADITIO Network is avidly read within the highest bowels of at Newrome and Menzingen (Neo-SSPX).  In addition to the Daily Commentaries from the Fathers, including lively commentary on Church news from the traditional perspective, TRADITIO's other fifteen departments provide resources and materials for its readers to study and learn about the traditional Roman Catholic Faith.
     <br/>
     <b>
      We are particularly touched by the many thousands of messages that we have received from Newchurchers of the New Order, including Neocon and pseudo-traditionalist Newchurchers, who tell us that they have been converted to the traditional Roman Catholic Faith because of TRADITIO's uncompromising, independent commentaries and materials.
     </b>
     The TRADITIO Network is one of many means through which Our Lord appears be working out the Traditional Catholic Restoration of the 21st century.
