      <h3>
       Overview
      </h3>
      <p>
       The OpenPrivacy initiative is an Open Source collection of software
     frameworks, protocols and services providing a cryptographically secure
     and distributed platform for creating, maintaining, and selectively
     sharing user profile information.
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect, OpenPrivacy is the first open platform that enables user
     control over personal data while simultaneously - and at user discretion
     - providing marketers with access to higher quality profile segments.
     The resulting marketplace for anonymous demographic profiles will create
     opportunities for a new breed of personalized services that provide
     people and businesses with timely and relevant information.  Throughout
     the system, information may be shared with guaranteed personal privacy,
     creating at last a level playing field for the user, marketer and
     infomediaries.
      </p>
      Several projects are in the works, listed with the most-developed
   initiative first:
      <blockquote>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         <a href="https://sierra.openprivacy.org/">
          Sierra
         </a>
         , a reference
         implementation of the Reputation Management Framework (RMF)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         OpenPrivacy's core project is designed to ease the process of
         creating community with reputation enhanced pseudonymous entities.
         The RMF is primarily a set of four interfaces: Nym Manager,
         Communications Manager, Storage Manager and Reputation Calculation
         Engine (RCE).  Sierra is a reference implementation that meets these
         interfaces.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         <a href="https://talon.openprivacy.org/">
          Talon
         </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         A simple yet powerful component system for Java.  Sierra is being
         developed using Talon and we expect that Talon will soon be able to
         use Sierra's reputation manager to drive component selection
        </dd>
        <dt>
         Zero-knowledge proof of sibling nym relationships by parent
        </dt>
        <dd>
         <i>
          paper forthcoming
         </i>
        </dd>
        <dt>
         <a href="/papers/200104-repcap.html">
          Reputation Capital Exchange
         </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         A secure mechanism for mapping between RCEs that use
         different trust metrics.  This is accomplished by first attaching an
         OpenPrivacy-style Nym to the local namespace user name, and then by
         authenticating a match between these secure nyms.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         <a href="https://reptile.openprivacy.org/">
          Reptile
         </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         An open source/free software Syndicated Content Directory Server
         (SCDS) that provides a personalized news and information portal with
         privacy and reputation accumulation.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         <a href="https://ucl.openprivacy.org/">
          User Content License
         </a>
         -
         Reversing the Privacy Policy Circle
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Adding an HTTP header
         <i>
          prior
         </i>
         to the request being transferred
         from client to server that contains a user copyright notice for any data
         transferred from the client.
         <i>
          (While not directly related to the
           concept of anonymous profile data, we think it's a cool hack!)
         </i>
        </dd>
       </dl>
      </blockquote>
      We are interested in finding people who would like to help with any and
   all of these projects.  OpenPrivacy is a grassroots effort creating open
   source (and free) code.  Our goal is to create a saner, safer Internet.
      <h3>
       Longer Term Goals
      </h3>
      The OpenPrivacy platform enables applications that will afford the user many
   direct benefits without the loss of privacy or fear that their data is being
   used inappropriately, including the ability to:
      <ul>
       <li>
        provide a standard framework (objects and protocols) for general
       purpose reputation management
       </li>
       <li>
        enjoy the benefits
        <i>
         (TBD: describe)
        </i>
        of personalized information
       without loss of privacy
       </li>
       <li>
        browse (if and when they chose) offers from businesses and marketers
       </li>
       <li>
        respond to offers directly or through third party infomediaries
       </li>
       <li>
        maintain confidence that their profile is being used only as permitted
       </li>
       <li>
        understand and leverage the value of their profile information
       </li>
      </ul>
      again, all of this
      <i>
       without the loss of privacy or fear that your data
     is being used inappropriately
      </i>
