            I
 started this site because I am sick of the ceaselessly glowing reviews
 and endless buzz about Harry Potter. I'm tired of the half-assed movies
 that capitalize on the books success. I'm tired of seeing Harry's face
 everywhere. I'm not afraid to say:
           </font>
          </p>
          <div align="center">
           <p>

              I HATE HARRY POTTER!

            Okay,
 I don't really hate Harry, but I hate what Harry has become to the
 genre. I've been an avid fantasy fan for as long as I can remember,
 having read literally hundreds of fantasy books. So, naturally when I
 first heard about a new book called
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/059035342X/awarenesspubl-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">
             Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
            </a>
            ,
 I eagerly picked it up. I cracked it open and was prepared to be
 mesmerized. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The book was merely a
 knockoff of so many other, BETTER, fantasy novels. I can conceive how
 people might feel attachment to Harry Potter, supposing they have never
 read the quality fantasy novels that permeate the literary world. It's
 like loving McDonalds because you've never had lobster.

          <p align="justify">
           <font face="Arial" size="+1">
            Although
 I was underwhelmed by the first book, the buzz continued to grow,
 bubbling from critics lava-like and unstoppable, so I decided to
 continue reading the series. I have begrudgingly finished all six books
 and I have to say I disliked it more as the books went on. I started to
 notice a pattern in all the books: all the same lazy formulas, the same
 regurgitated plot points in every book, and the same useless tangents
 that don't relate to the rest of the book. People claim that these
 droll repetitions are part of the charm but it's just evidence that JK
 Rowling is out of touch with the roots she claims to have in the
 fantasy genre. After finishing the 6th book I felt lost in a sea of
 mediocrity, fueled by the Harry Potter craze that never seems to wane.

            I
 have created this page in an effort to educate readers. I am happy that
 Harry Potter is encouraging people, especially children, to read and
 that this genre is getting some-well deserved attention. However, Harry
 Potter is not your only choice. The fantasy books listed here are rich,
 complicated, and most important, original. Many of them helped build
 the genre as we know it today. So, please, take some time and check out
 some of these books I have listed. If you want even MORE
 recommendations, feel free to
