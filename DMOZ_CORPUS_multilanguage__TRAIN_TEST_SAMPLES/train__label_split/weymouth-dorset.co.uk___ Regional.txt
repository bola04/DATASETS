         Weymouth is situated in the south of the county of Dorset on the south coast of England. Weymouth Bay is part of the English Channel and was known as "England's Bay of Naples".  What we think of as Weymouth today when we think of the seaside or the town centre, is in fact Melcombe Regis. They were once two separate places, their boundary being the harbour, with Weymouth on the south side and Melcombe Regis on the north. There was much feuding between the two and so in 1571, Elizabeth I granted a Royal Charter to unite them as the Borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis.
        </strong>

      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
       Melcombe Regis has a claim to fame as the port where the bubonic plague, known as the Black Death, entered England in 1348. It was brought ashore by the fleas of the black rats from a ship that had come from the continent and had devastating effects on the population of England.  It is estimated that at least half the population was wiped out in the two years that it lingered.  Naturally, those in Dorset were the first to suffer and people fearing that they would contract it moved away, unsuspecting that they too might be carriers and so it spread.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
       In 1583 Captain Richard Clark departed from Weymouth to join Sir Humphrey Gilbert in his discovery of Newfoundland. Trading links were then established and continued until such time as the Newfoundland trade and fishing became more associated with Poole.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
       In 1588 some of the English ships sailed from Weymouth to meet the Spanish Armada. Six of those ships were of Weymouth and carried over two hundred Weymouth men. There ensued a battle off Portland and the ship
       <i>
        San Salvador
       </i>
       was captured and brought into the harbour.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
       Weymouth was the port of departure for some of the first ships sailing to America. In 1623 Robert Gorges, the son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, left Weymouth with emigrants to settle in Wessagusset, New England. He was appointed Governor of the colony, which then changed its name to Weymouth.  The ship

        <i>
         Abigail
        </i>
       </a>
       set sail from Weymouth in 1628 carrying many Dorset emigrants bound for New England. This passage was particularly important as it carried the first governor of Massachusetts, John Endicott. A memorial commemorating this is sited by the harbour steps.  See also

       .
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
       In the 1640s there was fierce rivalry once again during the English Civil War.  Weymouth suffered badly and several hundred Dorset men were slain in one night of intense fighting in 1645.
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">
       In 1751 an act was passed which dramatically increased the tax levied on spirits. While it had the desired effect of reducing drunkenness among the common people, as they could no longer afford to consume it, it also led to a rise in smuggling.

        Smuggling
       </a>
       became rife along most of the South Coast. Weymouth and the surrounding area was no exception. The most notorious smuggler of Dorset was Isaac Gulliver who operated around the Bournemouth area, but there was also a notorious gang of smugglers operating around

King George enjoyed his time at Weymouth so much that he became a regular visitor and purchased Gloucester Lodge from his brother.  The Lodge became the Gloucester Hotel and in the 1980s was converted to apartments.

       In 1794 a packet steamer service was launched to operate between Weymouth and the Channel Islands. Subsequent services allowed for the "emigration" of several Dorset families to the islands and there are many recorded in the records of St. Peter Port.

       By 1808 the chalk figure of the White Horse and its rider had been carved in the hillside above Osmington. It is supposed to represent George III whose last visit to Weymouth was in 1805.  In 1810 the people of Weymouth erected a monument to George III which stands majestically in the centre of the road along the seafront. It was to commemorate his Golden Jubilee, but also to show gratitude for all he had done for the town. It marks the point where the two main streets of St. Mary Street and St. Thomas Street meet.

       The year 1824 brought the Great Gale or Tempest, which battered the Dorset coast. At Weymouth, the esplanade was destroyed, as a plaque on the seaward wall of the Tourist Information Centre tells.  Several people lost their lives on Portland when the sea crashed over the Chesil bank.  A few miles along the coast, the village of

       In 1836 the Weymouth workhouse, situated in Wyke Road, opened its doors to accommodate the poorest citizens. The workhouse later became the Portwey Hospital and after that closed it was converted into flats. The same year, 1836, Holy Trinity church on the Weymouth side of the harbour was also opened.  Two years later in 1838 Guildhall opened in St. Edmund Street, now the Weymouth and District Registry Office.

       came to Weymouth in 1857, being built on reclaimed land from Radipole Lake. The old station was of Brunel design. Two railway companies were accommodated, the Great Western Railway and the London and South Western Railway. A line from Weymouth to Portland was opened in 1865 with a specially built bridge across Radipole Lake. The bridge, a wooden one, and housing Melcombe Regis railway station, was replaced in 1909 with a metal construction. The harbour tramway was constructed in 1865 with the line running from Weymouth station, along Commercial Road down to the harbour.

       Weymouth also featured prominently in the participation of the D-Day landings in Normandy with many British and American soldiers having left the shores of England here. A memorial erected on the esplanade, opposite the Royal Hotel, records that 517,816 troops and 144,093 vehicles embarked at Weymouth between 6th June 1944 and 7th May 1945.  The

       Today Weymouth hosts many national and international events and in 2012, with Portland, was the venue for the sailing events of the Olympic Games. The Games have been and gone but not without medals being won for Great Britain in the sailing events, most notably, Ben Ainslie winning gold.
