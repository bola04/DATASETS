          Cassell's research interests originated in the study of human-human conversation and storytelling. Progressively she became interested in allowing computational systems to participate in these activities. This new technological focus led her to deconstruct the linguistic elements of conversation and storytelling in such a way as to embody machines with conversational, social and narrative intelligence so that they can interact with humans in human-like ways. Increasingly, however, her research has come to address the impact and benefits of technologies such as these on learning and communication.
         </p>
         <p>
          In particular, Cassell is credited with developing the Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA), a virtual human capable of interacting with humans using both language and nonverbal behavior. More recently Cassell has investigated the role that the ECA can play in children's lives, as a
          <i>
           virtual peer
          </i>
          support for learning. The most recent instantiations of the virtual peer technology have been in the service of scaffolding the learning of contingent social skills in children with high-functioning autism

           (more information here)
          </a>
          , and understanding the ways in which children who come to school speaking non-mainstream dialects of English can maintain this important index of culture and identity, while still achieving school success

           (more information here)
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          In other work, Cassell has employed linguistic and psychological metrics to examine the long term effects of online community on young people's self-esteem, self-efficacy, and sense of agency.  This work focuses on the
          <a href="http://www.articulab.justinecassell.com/projects/jrsummit/index.html">
           Junior Summit
          </a>
          , the world's first large-scale online community for young people, which in 1998 brought together in an online forum more than 3000 young people from 139 countries.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once machines have human-like capabilities, can they be used to evoke the best communicative skills that humans are capable of, the richest learning? This is the goal of Cassell's research: to develop technologies that evoke from humans the most human and humane of our capabilities, and to study their effects on our evolving world.
