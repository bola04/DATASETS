     <h2>
      History of Italian Design Furniture
     </h2>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Italian design
      </strong>
      refers to all forms of design in Italy, including interior design, urban design, fashion design and architectural design. Italy is recognized as being a worldwide trendsetter and leader in design. Italian furniture design in the 1900s was particularly well-known and grew to the heights of class and sophistication. In the early 1900’s Italian furniture designers struggled to create an equal balance between classical elegance and modern creativity. Moving forward to the 1910s and 1920s Italian furniture design was very similar to that of French art deco styles. Italian furniture is designed with exotic materials thus creating sumptuous furniture.

      What is Italian Style Furniture?
     </h2>
     <p>
      During the 15th century in Italy there arose great renewed interest in the heritage of the antique architecture, sculpture, furniture and other fine arts of ancient Rome, called the European renaissance. This revival of classicism in Italian furniture occurred principally between the years 1400 and 1650. 18th - early 19th century Renaissance took its rise in Italy where the Grecian ornament had influenced Roman and early Italian furniture.
