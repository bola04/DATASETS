           President, Neal Rzepkowski Welcomes You to Lily Dale

           </p>
           <p>
            On behalf of all of the Spirits of Lily Dale, both those living here in physical bodies in this dimension, as well as those “from the other side” who join us, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to our grounds, and to our program.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope you will take some time to become aware of the peaceful and healing “vibrations” of our safe and magical place. Here, some amazing things can be observed and experienced which may challenge your rational, logical mind. Yet, many forget that scientific studies have repeatedly shown that consciousness survives, even if our physical bodies do not.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, here in this “physical reality” where your consciousness is aware of You as “you”, we hope you can take advantage of the many opportunities we offer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let us help you to expand your psychic/mediumistic abilities, to deepen your sense of peace and serenity, and to feel the love and support of those whom you once knew and loved while they were on the “earth plane” and who now reach to you in love from “higher planes”.
           </p>

                 <p>
                  You can feel the energy as you drive the road toward the entrance; it is tranquil and enchanting there at Lily Dale. Our group had a wonderful time. Being there influences me in a positive way, and the impact stays with me every time I leave Lily Dale. It was nice to be with and visit with friends. It was psychologically uplifting. The messages was quite real and heartening. I Plan to visit the spirits of Lily Dale again soon. Thank you and have a blessed day.

                  My husband Jason &amp; I attended the 1pm Inspiration Stump Service. Due to rain that morning it was held in the auditorium. It was an excellent service . Every medium was a registered Lily Dale medium . My husband received a spirit greeting with great accuracy of events &amp; confirmation of his friend who passed away last year . He was moved . If you have a chance attend this service . It’s a great way to find a medium you like &amp; trust to have a full reading with… we love Lily Dale!

                  Imagine a place founded on the principles of supporting free thought and speech and see it years later as a collective of mediums, psychic and other sixth sense people. We saw a seminar which was nice and then toured the grounds and unique shops. In the late summer, consider this a getaway – especially if the weather is nice.

            President Neal Rzepkowski Welcome's You to Lily Dale
           </h2>
           <p class="box-sub-title">
            On behalf of all of the Spirits of Lily Dale, both those living here in physical bodies in this dimension, as well as those “from the other side” who join us, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to our grounds, and to our program.  
 
 I hope you will take some time to become aware of the peaceful and healing “vibrations” of our safe and magical place.  Here, some amazing things can be observed and experienced which may challenge your rational, logical mind.  Yet, many forget that scientific studies have repeatedly shown that consciousness survives, even if our physical bodies do not.  
 
 Now, here in this “physical reality” where your consciousness is aware of You as “you”, we hope you can take advantage of the many opportunities we offer.  
 
 Let us help you to expand your psychic/mediumistic abilities, to deepen your sense of peace and serenity, and to feel the love and support of those whom you once knew and loved while they were on the “earth plane” and who now reach to you in love from “higher planes”. 
 
 Neal Rzepkowski
