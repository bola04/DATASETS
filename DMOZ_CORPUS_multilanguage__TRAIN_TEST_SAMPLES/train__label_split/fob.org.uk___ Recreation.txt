        Welcome
 to the Friends of Blue web site.

      <p>
       The
 club, founded in 1973, exists to study under-glaze blue decoration on
 pottery using a
 transfer print, a technique developed in Britain during the last two
 decades of the eighteenth century, when patterns deriving from
 contemporary Chinese porcelain designs began to appear. Many of these
 early designs were very similar to what we know today as Willow
 Pattern. As time went on, however, and techniques improved and tastes
 changed, every kind of design imaginable was used, from stately homes
 to bowls of flowers, from historical scenes to ships at sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, these products of British potters are far
 better appreciated than ever before and are sought after by collectors,
 not only in the UK, but also abroad, particularly in North America, to
 where large quantities of the wares were exported during the first
 quarter of the nineteenth century.

        The Annual
 General Meeting and Day Conference
       </big>
       <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        this year will be held at the Spode Museum, Stoke-on-Trent on Sunday 8th July.
       </span>
       <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Arrive
 at 10am onwards for a 10.30am start. Main speaker Pat Halfpenny, with a
 second talk by Dick Henrywood. Finishing at 4pm. This is an important
 meeting since if we cannot get more volunteers for the committee,
 especially for secretary and editor of the bulletin, then the club will
 probably have to fold.

       A NEW WEBSITE
       <br/>
      </span>
      A new online exhibition has been launched uder the
 auspices of
 the Transferware Collectors Club and the Northern Ceramic Society.
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
       <br/>
      </span>
      This joint project relates the remarkable story of the
 production of printed pottery and porcelain in Great Britain from 1750
 to 1900 and is a valuable source of information for all collectors,
 researchers and lovers of blue &amp; white transferware.
