Built in the 1920's as a cold storage warehouse, our historic building was converted into a hotel in 1950's, changing names many times. In our suites, you still get the warehouse vibe with the spaciousness and original elevated window lines. Our massive rooftop indoor pool was added when the warehouse was transformed into a hotel in the 1950's.<\/p>\n<h2>The 80's \u2013 The Original Boutique Hotel Concept<\/h2>\n<p>In the early 80's, the River North area began its renaissance from run-down buildings, garages and warehouses to chic art galleries, restaurants, and fashionable shops. Our owners recognized the revival of the River North neighborhood and invested over $6M dollars into the renovation of the River North Hotel during this time. The hotel's innovative style and attitude helped shape the rebirth of this emerging neighborhood.<br><br>Styled after Ian Schrager's Morgans Hotel in New York City -  the original boutique hotel concept - Best Western River North Hotel sported black and white throws and hallway carpet for a \u201clived on\u201d feel when it opened in 1986. Hotel owner, Selwyn Malisoff, gravitated toward the eclectic d\u00e9cor of the Morgans, and designed his hotel with a similar cutting-edge aesthetic. It was Chicago's first boutique type hotel with a brand name.<br><br>Duvets made of men's shirt fabric and the open concept bed, now a standard in hotels, were truly unique back then.  The hotel's signature black and white checkered bathroom tiles are a clear nod to the hotels of the Morgans Group, and remain a bold design element in the River North Hotel today.<br><br>Several renovations later, to present, the hotel is still owned by the visionary Malisoff family. Pops of teal and metallic finishes, a casual eatery and pizzeria, and a rooftop indoor pool make the hotel a welcoming haven for travelers from around the Midwest and the world.<br><br>When it opened, the River North Hotel was the only hotel in the area that offered a room for less than $150 a night. Providing a stylish, spacious and affordable hotel room in Chicago remains a part of our philosophy. Immersed in River North's burgeoning cultural scene, we still offer the best value in downtown Chicago.<\/p>\n<h2>A Landmark Immersed in the Culture of River North<\/h2>\n<p>From its colorful Prohibition past to its punk rock heyday of the 60's to its present transformation, River North has been one of the Windy City's most vibrant places \u2013 a mix of historic and hip. Bordered by the Chicago River, west of Wabash Avenue and south of Division Street, River North is now a thriving destination with art galleries, residential high-rises, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, and a busting nightlife on and around Hubbard Street. The design district a few blocks north of the Merchandise Mart is lined with d\u00e9cor and furniture showrooms. And it's all just outside our doors.<br><br>A landmark with a rich legacy, the Best Western River North Hotel embraces its past, with a renewed modern energy.
