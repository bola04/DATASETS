                     DENY CLAIM, LOW BALL, DENY CLAIM, LOWBALL. If the claim entails a car, the body shop is pressured to use aftermarket parts so the auto repair is crappy.  Farmers Insurance Adjusters receive

               if they pay less for claims, like $25 gift certificates or pizza 
                     parties for an adjuster and her team.   The crap Farmers Insurance sells as 
                     insurance should actually be called " false sense of security". Customers feel 
                     and think they are insured, but when a claim is filed, Farmers Insurance uses 
                     all its power and resources to lowball or deny the claim.

Why did they send her when they knew our  devastation to our home?"..."She gave us 5900.00 for the damage. She closed our claim, and she lied  and said we did not have asbestos in our house after a drying out  company ordered the test."..."

              "About 
             10 years ago, a major hail storm hit our neighborhood - everyone in 
             Fridley got a new roof.  My next door neighbor (another farmers customer) 
             had to fight to get her roof paid for.  My insurance company came and 
             wrote me a check within 5 days of the storm. Farmers claimed her roof was 
             in bad shape to begin with so they wouldnt replace it. Mine was a lot 
             worse - I was going to get it replaced the following year. When the 
             Fridley officials came out to look at the damage this last time, they were 
             asking everyone who their insurance was through. When my neighbor told 
             them Farmers, the official said - "oh, no". They obviously have a 
             reputation." 1/26/2006

              "On 12/19/05, I had a fire in my 3000 sq ft custom built home. There 
             was actual fire and water damage to 800 sq ft, including my home 
             office, master bedroom, master bath and 2 large walk in closets. The 
             smoke damage throughout the rest of the house was extensive and 
             Farmers approved and deem it necessary to hire a fire &amp; water 
             restoration company to remove and clean all my household belongs at 
             their offsite facility. They took everything that was cleanable from 
             "beenie babies" to the refrigerator. The restorations companys bill 
             now stands at $55000.
              <br/>
              I have hired a contractor with 20 years of experience in fire 
             restoration to do the structural work. My contractor's estimate 
             stands at $96000. Farmers assigned my claim to a "newbie" 
             inexperienced adjuster." 1/29/2006

               "As a former senior claims adjuster for Farmers Insurance Exchange and a nationally recognized claims practices expert, I know firsthand to what lengths insurance companies will go to save money by not paying claims. Many insurance companies tie employee salaries and bonuses to practices that encourage and condone the delay, denial, underpayment and forced litigation of claims."-Robert Dietz

               Robert Dietz was a Senior Claims Adjuster for Farmers Insurance Exchange from 1987 until 2001. According to Robert, Farmers Insurance used Colossus to "automatically cut 20 percent from what they know they owe on a claim.” For details see

               According to memos from Farmers Insurance, Dietz and his colleagues’ salaries and bonuses were tied to practices that encouraged the delay, denial, underpayment and forced litigation of claims. One document encouraged adjusters to settle small claims below their value, adding adjusters should learn “…to say “sorry, no more,” with a toothy grin and mean it.”

                 Farmers Insurance Urged Employees to Pay as Little as Possible on Claims
                </font>
               </strong>
               Farmers Insurance Group of Los Angeles, the nation's fifth-largest auto insurer, had run nationwide promotions urging its employees to increase profits by paying as little as possible on claims." In June the North Dakota Department of Insurance fined Farmers Insurance $750,000. "Farmers gave employees goals to tighten payments and handed out bonuses when they met the objectives, the department found. Farmers' campaign, which included brochures and pep talks, had slogans such as ``Quest for Gold'' and `Bring Back a Billion.'".

               </strong>
               Jim Poolman, N.D Insurance Commissioner fined Farmers Insurance $750K, the largest insurance company penalty in state history. "Poolman says Farmers Insurance had

               </strong>
               . He says payments for some injuries were set according to predetermined ranges and weren't based on the merits of the claims. Poolman says the
               <strong>
                pay of some Farmers Insurance employees was pegged to whether they kept their insurance payouts down

               Farmers Insurance and sister company Mid-Century Insurance Co were each fined $20,000. "Examiners found more violations at Mid-Century than at Farmers, including the   failure to investigate claims in a timely manner and the failure to adequately   document claim files. Mid-Century also failed to settle claims timely and fairly   when liability was reasonably clear, examiners found. Both Mid-Century and Farmers failed to meet standards for settlements when a   vehicle is determined to be a total loss. For example, the companies wrongly   used cars that weren't comparable by body style or mileage to estimate values."

               "Take Tosha Mowry's case: In October 2005, she was 26 weeks pregnant. Mowry's   boyfriend, Mario Urzua, fell asleep driving her 2001 Lexus sedan near Warm   Springs on U.S. 26. Urzua drove across the barrier, severely injuring another   motorist and Mowry. Mowry was hospitalized with injuries to her head and uterus   as well as a fractured clavicle. Her unborn baby died the following day. Mowry carried a "100/300" policy with Farmers Insurance—meaning she believed   she'd get up to $100,000 per injured person, and up to $300,000 per crash   involving her car.
               <br/>
               Farmers said it would pay Mowry $25,000 for herself, and $25,000 for her   unborn child. Her initial medical bills totaled about $40,000 but her attorney   says future medical treatments and compensation for her pain and suffering   pushes her client's expenses well past Farmers' offer.
               <br/>
               "This is a classic example of a bait-and-switch," says Hala Gores, the   Portland attorney preparing a lawsuit on Mowry's behalf. "Farmers paid the   $100,000 maximum to the other driver...but they're only paying $25,000 for   Mowry's
