     (July 2017)
    </h3>
    <p>
     The last two years has seen me create an iPhone app and for defeat being snatched from the jaws of victory by the whole thing being abandoned at about 97% in to the project. I managed to extract, process and compress 29 million addresses from the UK Postoffice Address File (PAF) searchable and built into just 100 MB of data (that includes house numbers, names and flat numbers) and fast enough that as you drag the app's Google Map screen, it can tell you what street the map center is located over including any of over 350,000 points of interest (POI) that are ATMs, supermarkets, pubs, museums etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     All locations include lat/long though each postcodes location is roughly centred on the average lat long.
    </p>
    <p>
     You have to be licensed to use the PAF data and I wrote this in C# (Xamarin). It's fast enough to run on an iPhone 5 and flies on an iPhone 7. Search results update with each key press (about 1/10th second delay on an iPhone 5) and it returns up to 100 matching results sorted by distance from the phone's current location. Distances are calculated using a speeded up version of the trigonometric calculations formula for working out distances between two lat/longs.
    </p>
    <p>
     I also wrote a suite of programs to automatically extract the data from the PAF and transform that used by the app.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can't supply the PAF (it's not mine..) so please don't ask! The code however...
