           This is the story of the Japanese prisoner of war camps on the island of Taiwan (Formosa) during the Second World War and of the men who were interned in them.

           <em>
            It seems that  many  people  know about the hardship and suffering of the POW's working on the  Death Railway in Thailand and Burma, but few know about the "hell-camps" of Taiwan.  We hope to tell the story of the suffering and deprivation endured by the POW's  so that all will know - and hopefully never forget!

          </b>
          in downtown Taipei. There will be a display of POW and military artifacts, we will have a short memorial service to remember the POWs, and then the film
          <strong>
           “PARADISE ROAD”
          </strong>
          will be featured.
         </p>
         <p>
          This excellent film, directed by Academy Award-winning Australian Bruce Beresford, depicts the lives of the civilian women - including the Australian nurses, who were captured by the Japanese in Sumatra and how they formed a choir to help overcome their situation and torment and survive. The film stars Glenn Close and Frances McDormand.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is based on a true story, and accurately portrays the brutality shown even to women and children by their Japanese captors. It also shows how they triumphed over adversity. It is a very moving film and provides another aspect of the POWs’ story, this time as pertaining to the civilians.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Please note that the film is not suitable for small children and there are no Chinese subtitles on the film.

          Anne Frank (1929-1945), a young Jewish girl, went into hiding with her family in a secret upper room annex in a house in the Netherlands to escape from Nazi persecution. At age 13, she wrote in her diary the incredible story of their lives in hiding.
          <b>
           ‘The Diary of a Young Girl’
          </b>
          is also a testament to the mass murder of Jewish people by the Nazis. The diary has been translated and published in more than 70 languages and has inspired millions of people ever since.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another group of young girls lived at the same time as Anne and suffered much like her – the so-called "comfort women," victims of sexual violence perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army, whom we now refer to with the term of respect “Ama.” Fifty years later, these women in their old age finally were able to speak about their traumas and prove the existence of sexual enslavement in the war. They have also zealously fought for women’s rights and inspired the survivors of sexual violence around the world.

          The Taiwan POW Camps Memorial Society has worked together with the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation for many years in seeking to make the story of the Comfort Women and the allied prisoners of war who were held on Taiwan known. Our goals are the same - to make sure that their story is told to the world, so that they and what they suffered under the Japanese will never be forgotten!

          Back in 2008 the Society arranged for the interment of the ashes of the late L/Bdr. George Harrison of the 5th Field Reg’t. Royal Artillery - a hero of Kinkaseki Camp, at the Surrey and Sussex Crematorium at Crawley in Sussex UK. We also decided to place a wooden bench in honour and memory of him and Gnr. Alfred Foster – who was also from Crawley, and the men of the 5th Field Reg’t. in the crematorium garden.
         </p>
         <p>
          This was duly accomplished in September of that year and the wooden bench has served the visitors to the crematorium well over the past ten years. The bench has needed replacing and so in consultation with the management over the past year or so, it was decided to replace the wooden bench with one made of granite which will last in perpetuity in honour and memory of the men.  This project has recently been completed and we are happy to announce that the new bench is now in place. We are very grateful to the crematorium for their help in continuing to honour the former Taiwan POWs in this way.

            ENOURA MARU MEMORIAL - PROJECT COMPLETED!
           </span>
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          After seven years of negotiations and struggles with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and their National Cemetery Administration (NCA) to have a memorial stone for the more than 300 men who died on the hellship
          <em>
           Enoura Maru
          </em>
          placed on the Walk of Remembrance at the Punchbowl Cemetery in Hawaii, we are pleased to report that we have finally achieved our goal.
         </p>
         <p>
          We had received the approval for the memorial stone in January and for the past several months have been fundraising with the objective to raise US$6,000.00 for the memorial stone construction, its transport to Hawaii and the costs for the dedication ceremony which will take place on August 15th of this year.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are pleased to report that as of June 1st we have reached that goal and the funds are now all in. We want to thank all those members and friends of our POW Society and the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor Memorial Society for their contributions to this worthwhile cause. Now because of your faithfulness and generosity the men of the Enoura and Brazil Maru hellships will always be recognized, remembered and honoured where they lay - at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are thankful that we have finally been able to realize our dream, and that of the families of the Enoura Maru men - to have this very fitting memorial stone placed on the Walk of Remembrance in their honour.
         </p>
         <p>
          Preparations are now being made for the dedication ceremony to be held at the Punchbowl on AUGUST 15TH of this year. We are expecting to have several former POWs, and also family members of the Enoura Maru POWs in attendance, and further information on the ceremony itself will be forthcoming in the next few weeks. Please watch the website for details.

            In 2009 six former Taiwan POWs returned to Taiwan to join in the annual Remembrance Day service at Kinkaseki. Society supporter and good friend Chen, Hsiao - Fang produced a slide show of the event and we invite you to watch it and remember these men to whom we owe a debt that can never be repaid.

             USS FINCH LIST FOUND!

           </h3>
           <p>
            The Society has been urgently seeking information regarding the POWs who were evacuated from Taiwan on September 6, 1945 on the aircraft carrier USS Santee CVE-29, and the Destroyer Escorts USS Brister DE-327 and USS Finch DE-328. We have searched various archives to try to find the ships' deck logs and service records, but up to now nothing has turned up.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, thanks to some help from a researcher friend in the US, we have found the complete list of men carried on the USS Finch. So that just leaves the USS Brister and USS Santee that we still need complete lists for.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there are any former crew members of these ships who know of the lists that were made and where they might now be, please kindly get in touch with us.
           </p>
           <p>
            We would also like to hear from former POWs and their families if they have any knowledge that their relative or anyone they knew sailed on either of these two ships. We would be very grateful for any help and information we can get.
