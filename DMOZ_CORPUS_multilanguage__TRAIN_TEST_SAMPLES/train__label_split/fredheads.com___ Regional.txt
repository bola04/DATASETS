          Look, all the republicans are dooming and glooming about the incoming 
 		democratic President.  Why is everyone so upset?  It's because they 
 		think this President will give away the store to all the miscreants with 
 		their hands out?  If you believe that, listen again to his victory 
 		speech.  That speech is a call to arms.  It is a cry out to us, U.S. 
 		citizens, to roll up our shirt sleeves and get to work building better 
 		lives for ourselves.

          Do you really think his plan is to support another nation of welfare

 		person to welfare case.  He's leveling the playing field from billion 
 		dollar bailouts to folks just like you and me.  You and me...the people 
 		with dreams and aspirations to become better Americans not with anyone's 
 		handout but with, at least, a more level playing field against corporate 
 		oligopoly.

           We started FredHeads.com as encouragement 
 	to Fred Thompson to enter the race.  One of our first main-page posts after 
 	Fred failed to announce his candidacy on July 4, 2007 was entitled "What's 
 	the Holdup?"  This post told Fred and his staff to stop with the ambiguities 
 	and announce his candidacy.  Within hours of uploading that post, we were 
 	contacted by The Hill in Washington, DC.  The reporter queried why Fredheads 
 	were becoming disgruntled.

          On the same day The Hill published our 
 	story, CNN and The New York Times wanted interviews.  It is funny how a 
 	seemingly negative story will pull reporters out of the woodwork.  No 
 	disrespect was meant to Mr. Thompson.  Instead, a fire just needed to be lit 
 	under the campaign's butt to get it moving.

          January 8, 2008:  Ron Paul gets his due on Jay Leno.

         The FredHeads.com website (as well as its 
 operator) has been trashed more than once by Ron Paul supporters.  Out of 
 retaliation, maybe I should not give their candidate any air time what-so-ever.  
 However, I feel Ron Paul has been treated unfairly by mainstream media.

         Ron is a legitimate candidate with a 
 significant following.  He is polling well and he has a full-enough war 
 chest to pursue his campaign through election day.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Why was Paul disallowed the ability to join in this week's debates?  I 
 think this is an injustice.  Ron Paul has a viable platform and I tend to 
 agree with his stance on Iraq as well as his foreign policy.  However, I 
 believe his policy will deteriorate under scrutiny.  I call for equal time 
 for this candidate.  If his policy does not crumble under the magnifying 
 glass, so be it but let's not hide him away as if we are scared that he might 
 actually have something to say.

         January 06, 2008:  
 Is it not time that those who go around spreading rumors should be held 
 accountable for the damage done by those rumors?  Did the rumors of Fred's 
 impending departure cost him 2 to 3 points in Iowa?  If so, let the 
 scoundrel who started the rumor lose 2 to 3 points from his candidate's results 
 in NH.  Do you agree,
