        Is the WiNRADiO WR-G35DDCi 'EXCALIBUR Ultra'
        <br/>
        the world's best shortwave receiver?
       </h3>
       <p>
        For many years in a row, without interruption, WiNRADiO and RADIXON receivers continue to rule the radio waves with the world's best and most innovative receivers. This year is no exception and the experts at the WRTH publication - independent 60+ years old authority on radio broadcasting - do agree! Our latest WR-G35DDCi HF receiver breaks new grounds with its 32 MHz processing and recording bandwidth (the entire shortwave spectrum!), exceptional sensitivity and dynamic range, laboratory-grade test and measurement facilities including a 45 MHz wide real-time spectrum analyzer, and many other innovative features.
       </p>
       <p>
        "It is very difficult to imagine that in sheer performance terms a receiver of the calibre of the Excalibur Ultra will ever be supplanted."
