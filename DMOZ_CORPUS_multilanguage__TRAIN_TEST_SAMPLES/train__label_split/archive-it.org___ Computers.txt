               Open Sound New Orleans was a community media project that from 2007-2012 invited and enabled New Orleanians to document their lives in sound. New Orleanians could participate by recording, or making recording requests for, the important sounds and voices in their lives and adding them to a soundmap. In order to facilitate a diversity of direct dispatches from around our city, we lent recording equipment ‚Äì and offered training in its use ‚Äì to community organizations, neighborhood groups and individuals. While the project is no longer accepting contributions, previously contributed recordings can still be shared, reused and adapted by others (please refer to our license for additional information).

               From our mission: ‚ÄúOur intent is to make more accessible the authentic, unedited sounds and voices of New Orleans. Sharing the sounds of our city as we hear them, move through them, and create them, is an act of celebration. But it also serves each contributor ‚Äì you and me and anyone else who might participate ‚Äì as a simple way to extend our own experience to others, harness our representations and those of our city, and participate in New Orleans' public culture with intentionality.‚Äù

               A brief history of the County: The Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake valley in 1847 to establish a religious settlement, and the ‚ÄúState of Deseret‚Äù government was created. The Legislative Assembly officially created Great Salt Lake County on January 31, 1850. Over 11,000 residents lived in the County at that time. The first formal meeting of Salt Lake County government occurred on March 15, 1852, eighteen months after the Utah Territory was established by the United States Congress. Probate judges and county selectmen functioned in what was known as the County Court. The duties of the County Court included both judicial and executive powers for the administration of county government.
  
 With statehood in 1896, a county commission was created. At this time, County government had a County Auditor, Assessor, Attorney, Clerk, Recorder, Sheriff, Surveyor, and Treasurer ‚Äì the same independent offices that exist today. In 2000, a new Mayor/Council form of government was chosen by the voters to replace the County Commission.  Today, County government serves over 1 million residents.

We do this by focusing on hands-on education; enabling pupils to become self-motivated, competent, and life-long learners, equipped for the challenges of the 21st Century. We teach Kindergarten through Eighth grade and our Archive-It group is made up of a few dedicated Eighth grade students.

               The Bentley Historical Library was established in 1935 by the University of Michigan Regents to carry out two functions: to serve as the official archives of the university and to document the history of the state of Michigan and the activities of its people, organizations and voluntary associations.  The materials in the Bentley Historical Library Web Archives reflect the mission and priorities of the library as we seek to preserve online resources of unique, essential, and enduring value.

               As the preeminent institution devoted to the art of the United States, the Whitney Museum of American Art presents the full range of twentieth-century and contemporary American art, with a special focus on works by living artists. The Whitney is dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting, and exhibiting American art, and its collection--arguably the finest holding of twentieth-century American art in the world--is the Museum's key resource. The Museum's signature exhibition, the Biennial, is the country's leading survey of the most recent developments in American art.
              </p>
              <p class="seamTextPara">
               Innovation has been a hallmark of the Whitney since its beginnings. It was the first museum dedicated to the work of living American artists and the first New York museum to present a major exhibition of a video artist (Nam June Paik in 1982). Such figures as Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, and Cindy Sherman were given their first museum retrospectives by the Whitney. The Museum has consistently purchased works within the year they were created, often well before the artists became broadly recognized. The Whitney was the first museum to take its exhibitions and programming beyond its walls by establishing corporate-funded branch facilities, and the first museum to undertake a program of collection-sharing (with the San Jose Museum of Art) in order to increase access to its renowned collection.
              </p>
              <p class="seamTextPara">
               Designed by architect Renzo Piano and situated between the High Line and the Hudson River, the Whitney's new building vastly increases the Museum‚Äôs exhibition and programming space, providing the first comprehensive view of its unsurpassed collection of modern and contemporary American art.

               Henry Clay Frick (1849‚Äì1919), the coke and steel industrialist, philanthropist, and art collector, left his New York residence and his remarkable collection of Western paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts to the public ‚Äúfor the purpose of establishing and maintaining a gallery of art, [and] of encouraging and developing the study of fine arts and of advancing the general knowledge of kindred subjects.‚Äù Designed and built for Mr. Frick in 1913 and 1914 by Thomas Hastings of Carr√®re and Hastings, the mansion provides a grand domestic setting reminiscent of the noble houses of Europe for the masterworks from the Renaissance through the nineteenth century that it contains. 
 
 Renowned for its small, focused exhibitions and for its highly regarded concert series and lectures, The Frick Collection also operates the Frick Art Reference Library, founded by Henry Clay Frick‚Äôs daughter, Helen Clay Frick, located in an adjoining building at 10 East 71st Street. Both a research library and a photo archive, the Frick Art Reference Library is one of the world‚Äôs great repositories of documents for the study of Western art. It has served the international art world for more than seventy-five years.

Increasingly, these records are born digital and dynamic. Web archiving not only preserves the University's web presence but also leverages the University's website and social media accounts as aggregators of digital information about the University - including reports, strategic plans, press releases, viewbooks, and media - that are otherwise vulnerable to digital degradation or loss.

               The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art arose from the instincts and ambitions of two private individuals who shared the dream of providing a public art museum for Kansas City and the surrounding region.

              <p class="seamTextPara">
               William Rockhill Nelson, founder of The Kansas City Star, was convinced that for a city to be truly civilized, art and culture were necessities. When he died in 1915, the bulk of his estate was used to establish the William Rockhill Nelson Trust for the purchase of works of art ‚Äúwhich will contribute to the delectation and enjoyment of the public generally.‚Äù The Nelson estate was combined with Mary Atkins‚Äô legacy to build an art museum for the people of Kansas City. The William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art and the Mary Atkins Museum of Fine Arts opened to the public on Dec. 11, 1933.  Today, the Nelson-Atkins maintains collections of more than 35,000 works of art and welcomes 500,000 visitors a year.
