    <p>
     Going to Mande White Yoga has transformed my life. I used to be exhausted and injured from wokring hard as a lawyer and runnning every day, but now I am injury free and I have discovered new energy and fun through yoga. Mande has enabled me to do things I havent done since I was a gymnast in my youth and I have real pride in the flexibility and strength I have built through working hard under Mande’s guidance. My brain function has also imporved with all that blood to the head and that helps me a lot in my work.
    </p>
    <p>
     I also feel younger now than I did when I started training with Mande at the start of 2015.I have tried other yoga instructors but Mande’s variety of movements, combination of building strength and flexibility, sequencing and inspirational teaching style is unbeatable. I know I will do yoga until I die. It has become an essentail part of my self care. Thank you Mande for giving me a new life!

     Mande while teaches with a gentle yet powerful insight, her classes are intense yet informative and not only focus on the strengthening and flexibility parts of yoga but the healing and restorative process’s for the human body. The outcome, I feel refreshed, aligned and balanced with a calm stamina that allows me to push through work and life.

     Its not often you find a yoga instructor so good that you’re prepared to plan your whole day around trying to get to a mid week lunch time class but Mande Whites classes are so motivating.  Having had serious injuries Mande’s classes are perfect for me because she provides a style of yoga that is challenging enough for me and that compliments for existing gym strength work something you don’t find enough in the yoga world.  Mandes classes are functional, therapeutic but I always leave feeling like I have had a “proper” workout  a factor that is important to me her classes are the perfect compliment to my gym training and play a huge role in me keeping my body and mind in balance.  Her classes are educative, intensely challenging yet are also intuitively designed to reduced the stress, tension and pressure the stressful aspects of western lifestyles have on our bodies.  And because of this i don’t think any other instructor has inspired me to love yoga and integrate it into my life as much and Mande.

     In the past I had always thought of yoga as being ‘nice to have’ as part of my workout schedule but could never really justify yoga as one of those workouts.  Mande’s offering of challenging classes with plenty of variety certainly changed my mind on that front.  Mande’s ability to change your thinking from ‘can’t do’ to ‘can do’ is very infectious and you always walk away after class with a sense of personal achievement.  I began doing Mande’s classes four years ago and my mindset has certainly charged over that time.  I can’t imagine my weekly workout schedule without those classes now!

     Over the four years that I’ve been doing yoga I have noticed a tremendous change in my body both posturally and in the way that it moves.  The benefits of yoga have helped in the other aspects of my fitness regime too.  The positive improvements i’ve achieved in both my flexibility and mobility have enabled me to perform strength training exercises more correctly.  My body has become more balanced during the time that i have been doing yoga and I feel that i demonstrate a more youthful posture as a result.

     Knight Coldicutt has had Mande White as our yoga instructor for a number of years.  We love doing yoga with Mande once a week as a corporate group, as it gives us all a chance to change gears and pace together, as well as taking a break away from the day to day routine of the screen and desk.  The stretching combined with Mande’s vast knowledge of health and nutrition sets us up for the balance of the week and takes us into the weekend with enthusiasm.  Mande is a special person and the way that she conducts her classes in a friendly, yet thorough and professional fashion, is a benefit to all that come in contact with her.
