      Welcome to the home of The Learning Centre School
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p>
      At The Learning Centre School we promote both academic excellence and excellence of character in the context of a Christian worldview.  While students receive a strong educational foundation on which to build their lives, they are also challenged to reach their highest spiritual potential by learning Biblical truth and Christian values.  These values are the heart of our philosophy and curriculum at TLCS.  Working as a team with our students parents, we endeavor to equip our students to become the leaders of their generation and a strong influence in our world.
     </p>
     <p>
      The goal of The Learning Centre School (TLCS) is to develop students with strong character as well as academic excellence, in a positive and distinctly Christian environment. TLCS offers a Christian based curriculum that fully aligns with the Botswana Government syllabus for primary and secondary schools. We offer both traditional IGCSE syllabus and a second, internationally recognized, computer-assisted curriculum for secondary students.
     </p>
