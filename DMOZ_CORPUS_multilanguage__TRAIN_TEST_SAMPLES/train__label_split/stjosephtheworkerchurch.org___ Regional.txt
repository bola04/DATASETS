      We can see our own gifts multiplied
     </h3>
     <p>
      Today's Gospel reading recounts Jesus' miracle of feeding the multitude. In a miracle that anticipated Jesus' miracle of feeding the multitude, as reported in today's Gospel, Elisha commanded that a small amount of bread be served to 100 men, and Jesus promised that all would indeed be fed. Elisha trusted that promise, acted upon it, and saw the promise miraculously fulfilled. We, like most people, tend to forget the miracles our Lord can work in everyday life. If we trust in God and live as good stewards, what we accomplish is, in its own way, a miracle.
     </p>
     <p>
      St. Paul beautifully sums up how our approach to living as Catholics and Christians should be. In today's Second Reading from his letter to the Ephesians, Paul urges us to live "with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another through love, striving to preserve the unity of spirit through the bond of peace: one body and one Spirit." Does that describe our parish community?
     </p>
     <p>
      This cannot happen unless we have the same kind of trust that Elisha had, and which St. Paul had, as well. Paul also says in today's Second Reading, "I urge you to live in a manner worthy of the call you have received." This is stewardship at its core. We should not give of our time, talent and treasure because we want to earn God's love. He already loves us unconditionally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jesus knew full well what miracle He was about to perform, but He also saw this as a chance to teach His Apostles, and also show us the way. Philip and the others had already seen Jesus perform many miracles, and there should have been no question in his mind about the divine resources Jesus had at His disposal. Yet Philip hesitated. It is human nature to be doubtful. Yet, as with Elisha, they all ate, and there was much left over. Through this miracle, Jesus is teaching us to trust Him and to do the same in our lives. And, by committing ourselves to a stewardship way of life, we can see our own gifts multiplied. And perhaps even perform our own modernday miracles.

      The Way of Peace:
      <br/>
      Finding Rest in an Anxious World
     </h3>
     <p>
      <i>
       - Sam Guzman
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      The world is in turmoil. Everywhere, people cry, "peace, peace." But there is no peace. Our hearts are filled with anger, envy, violence, and anxiety. Every day, a tumultuous and passion-filled torrent of words and emotions gushes forth on the internet and across cable news networks.
     </p>
     <p>
      We long for rest, for tranquility, but cannot find it anywhere. In their desperation, some would even impose peace by force, by beating their ideological enemies into submission—a bitter paradox if there ever was one. The upheavals of the world are not random. They are simply a reflection of the emptiness and futile strivings of our own hearts. St. James the Apostle diagnoses the ills of our time:
     </p>
     <p>
      What causes wars, and what causes fighting among you? Is it not your passions that are at war in your members?  You desire and do not have; so you kill. And you covet and cannot obtain; so you fight and wage war.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our passions are running wild, and they are killing us.
     </p>
     <h4>
      St. Paul's Prescription
     </h4>
     <p>
      The way of the world is the way of anxiety and death, but the way of the Lord is the way of peace and  life. The enemy of our souls is the one who sows enmity and hate and striving against one another. The only solution to the peace of the world is to find peace in our own hearts.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have a natural tendency to think our own times are the worst that have ever existed. Yet, St. Paul lived in times that were more painful than our own. His whole world was in turmoil, with the Jewish authorities persecuting the burgeoning Church, heresies invading from all sides, and wayward Christians bickering and forming factions. In these trying circumstances, St. Paul labored tirelessly to preach the Gospel, a seemingly impossible task.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wherever he went, he met adversity. He was relentlessly persecuted, beaten, stoned and left for dead, starved, shipwrecked, imprisoned, and maligned. If anyone had a right to be anxious and discouraged, it was St. Paul.
     </p>
     <p>
      But that was not his answer. Despite the literal and figurative stormy seas that he encountered, St. Paul was always at peace. In his letter to the Philippians, St. Paul outlines his prescription for soul peace in troubled times.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
     </p>
     <h4>
      Rejoice Always
     </h4>
     <p>
      <b>
       The very first thing St. Paul encourages is rejoicing.
      </b>
      Be joyful. Let your joy shine from your face. Do not be discouraged or disheartened.
     </p>
     <p>
      But how, you might ask, can one be joyful when there is so much pain and suffering the world?  It is often easier said than done. The answer is simply because we serve a good God who loves mankind, and he has  trampled down death by his own death on the Cross.  We rejoice because we know that while we are daily surrounded by defeat, we serve Jesus Christ, who defeated defeat by being defeated—and rose victorious to die no more. It is in encountering the risen Christ, most  especially in the Eucharist, we experience the joy of his victory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rejoicing is not optional for the Christian. In another letter, St. Paul tell us to "give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God for you." Give thanks in all circumstances. Not by finding something positive to be happy about in the mess, though there is nothing wrong with this, but rather giving thanks for the tribulations themselves. This is the sure way to joy and the highest form of thanksgiving. It is only possible by grace. Yet rejoicing, even in trials, is the path to peace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Second, we are told to be gentle.
      </b>
      Gentleness is not much valued in today's world of swagger and machismo. Violence, both literal and rhetorical, rules the day. But it should never characterize the followers of the Crucified, who should be known for their meekness, humility, and gentleness towards all, especially those who hate us or despise us—our enemies. Do not return cursing for cursing, no matter how tempting it may be, but rather bless those who malign and persecute you and pray for them, so that you may be truly the children of God, not in word only, but in reality. Peace starts with hearts full of peace, not vengeance and retribution.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       The third thing St. Paul exhorts us to is prayer.
      </b>
      Only in opening our hearts to the Lord God will we find peace. A holy man once said, and I paraphrase, that looking for peace in external circumstances is foolish. They will never truly exist. The only peaceful place on earth is the heart when the Lord is there. It is only in communion with the Prince of Peace in our deepest heart that we will find the peace we so desperately crave. And how to we come to know Christ? How do we abide in him as the branch abides in the vine? By prayer.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Pray without ceasing," St. Paul tells us in another place. Prayer is the tuning of the heart to God. The more we grow in the awareness of his presence, the more our hearts will be at peace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Finally, we are told to fill our minds with what is good and true.
      </b>
      So often, we think entertainment is harmless. We believe all the "right" things, so we imagine we can consume whatever we want. This simply isn't true.  In a very real sense, we commune with what we consume. It becomes part of us. Watching endless violence and debauchery on TV is not harmless. Likewise, watching a 24 hour news cycle intent on creating feelings of dread and doom and filled with all the worst humanity has to offer is a quick recipe for anxiety.
     </p>
     <p>
      St. Paul is clear: Don't dwell on what is evil. You are taking this knowledge into yourself and it is becoming part of you. Neither can you ever expect to find peace by filling your mind with the horrendous acts that stream across the internet and cable news networks incessantly. Dwell on what is good and holy. Read and watch and consume what will elevate your mind and fill your heart with peace, for you will become what you gaze upon.

 <p><b>St. Joseph the Worker received a wonderful mention in
 the May 2018 issue of "FIRST THINGS" by renowned editor, R.R. Reno:</b></p>
 <p>"On a recent trip to the Bay Area, I went to church at the
 Berkeley parish of St. Joseph the Worker. The priest celebrated
 ad orientem, which as I've noted many times in
 these pages accentuates the sacrificial character of the
 Mass and gives the entire service a stronger vertical
 thrust.</p>
 <p>The Sanctus and Agnus Dei, along with a few other elements
 of the service, were sung in Latin with the natural
 dignity of plainchant. The congregants received the sacrament
 on their knees at the altar rail. All of this took
 place in a more than one-hundred-year-old building with
 modest iconography of a traditional sort.</p>
 <p>I was reminded yet again that liturgical transcendence is
 readily accessible. There was nothing revanchist about
 the service at St. Joseph the Worker, nothing archaeological,
 nothing remotely alien to the experience of
 Catholics raised on the reforms of the Second Vatican
 Council. Instead, the worship was elevated by the fact
 that the liturgy was not unnecessarily puerile and complacent.</p>
 <p>I tip my hat to Fr. Kenneth Nobrega, the priest-in-charge
 at St. Joseph the Worker."</p>

      Why Light a Votive Candle?
     </h4>
     <p>
      A Votive Light is a "silent sentinel" and can burn for your special intentions or for someone who is in need of prayers.  This is a thoughtful expression of your sentiments and best wishes for any occasion.  Your Votive Light can be an act of faith and charity - the light is a symbol of the sacrifice you have made in behalf of someone else - and it is a silent reminder of your prayers for them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unlike a regular purchase, a votive candle donation is an "offering" made to God through the intercession of the Saints which also helps support our St. Joseph the Worker Church's mission of beautiful liturgies, reconciliation and healing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your prayerful votive offerings are "lighting up" our church with beauty and prayer.  Thank you, and may God bless you.
