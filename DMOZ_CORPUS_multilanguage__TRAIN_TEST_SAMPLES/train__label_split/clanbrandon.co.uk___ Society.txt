             We've made yet another international
                         move, this time back to Steve's home country of New Zealand.
                         Benjamin is in Year 3 at school, Toby has started Kindergarten,
                         Varya is doing voluntary Mental Health / Social Work
                         work.

             Internet work for Operation Mobilisation continues from
                     the other side of the world though! There is a huge amount
                     going on, from Facebook pages for Operation Mobilisation,
                     to various OM web sites, and the crucial OM intranet system
                     that Steve is in charge of.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please pray for this vital aspect of OM's communication
                     and technical work. We covet your prayers!

                       20th we returned to the United Kingdom; we’re on
                       sabbatical here until January 2006, after which time we

                       he’s been the most laid-back baby imaginable! 
                 Benji and Toby are already best of friends, and we love to see
                       their mutual love and admiration! Praise the Lord for a
                       quick labour (1hr 11min) and for being able to deliver

             We had been cautious about our first visit back to the Czech
                   Republic after our rather hurried departure last October. In
                   the event we had none of the negative emotions we had anticipated.
                   It felt like we had never been away - our Czech language was
                   fairly fluent, we loved every bit of it. English camp was awesome
                   as always, and we came away feeling that a part of our hearts
                   will always remain in the Czech Republic, even if we’re not
                   able to live there again.

                   his reading has come on in leaps and bounds, and he’s also
                   going to tennis and swimming lessons. What a boy.

             As a way of reaching out to ordinary Czechs, and kicking
                     off new friendships, the English Summer Camps can’t
                     be beaten. This was our 3rd camp, and already we have
                     made a number of non-Christian friends through this and other
                     past camps.

             Varya was one of two teachers running OM Czech’s English
                     school. There are two semesters per year, and about 50 students
                     attend each. This is a great way to reach out to our community,
                     and maintain close contact with students.
