            Dear friends of Bubby,
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Six years ago we started a blog with our grandmother, Bubby, as a way to share her wise advice with the world. We knew that everyone would love her wit, candor and compassion.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This little experiment soon turned into something more special than we could have ever imagined. Within months, Bubby was receiving letters from thousands of people around the world, pouring out their hearts, and sharing their most personal stories with our grandmother. She loved offering her help. She loved reading your letters every day. She was so proud to be a Bubby to all of you.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Sadly, last night, we lost our Bubby.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            At 94, she was still beautiful.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Thank you for all of your contributions over the years. You helped make her life that much more special.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            With love,
            <br/>
            the granddaughters

              Reader Update!
             </b>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In July of 2006, we received a letter from a 29-year old woman with a
             <a href="http://helpmebubby.blogspot.com/2006/07/dear-bubby-i-was-supposed-to-be.html">
              broken heart
             </a>
             . And this wasn't the first time she had to pick up the pieces.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             She and her fiance were supposed to be married in 2005, but he called it off and they parted ways. 6 months later he found his way back to her, begged for forgiveness, re-proposed, and she accepted. A few months went by and he called off the wedding again. But of course he kept her dangling and her hopes for a third reunion remained high.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             When you hear a story like this, you want to yell from the rooftops, "FORGET HIM!" But as we all know, the heart can be hard-of-hearing sometimes. And this girl needed some advice. Leave it to Bubby to set things straight.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Bubby wasted no time referring to this man as an "
             <em>
              immature fellow
             </em>
             ." She wrote, "
             <em>
              I recommend you forget him and if he calls, just tell him the party is over... There are many fish in the sea and I am sure there is one who is looking for you... Life with this person will never happen. I wish you all the happiness in the world."
             </em>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Even an anonymous commenter left a note saying: "
             <em>
              Bubby's quite right. If he breaks it off once, and comes back, and all's well, fine. We all make mistakes, and we all have doubts. If he breaks it off twice?! Run, and never look back."
             </em>
             <br/>
             <br/>
             There is nothing we love more at this website than an update letter with a happy ending. So we are pleased to report that nearly 3 years to the date of this original posting, we heard from this woman again.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             What do you think happened? Did he finally grow a pair? Did she learn her lesson? Did she take Bubby's advice?" Read on to find out...

             Dear Bubby,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I wanted to write to up-date you and to thank you for the very good advice you gave me some three years ago now. My then fiance had called off our wedding for the second time and I was so distressed. You said I should forget this immature person who had wasted so much of my time.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I took your advice and it really really worked out! After deciding to end all contact with my ex-fiance, I worked hard on my career and found a fantastic new job. The very first month I met a colleague in another department and, in time, we fell in love. We married last year and are now expecting our first child.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             With my ex, everything was difficult. With my now husband, everything is easy - we can really talk and he is so kind, fun and gentle. And, he was, from the beginning, absolutely sure about me. He is also supportive of my career as we work in the same field, something my ex never was. Really, he just cares deeply about my happiness and I couldn't imagine that I could ever love someone as much as I love him.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I never would have found this wonderful man if I hadn't taken your advice.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Anyway, just to thank you. Writing to you and receiving your sensible response was a great comfort to me then, and I am so grateful I listened to your wisdom.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Wishing you and your family every happiness,
             <br/>
             <em>
              No longer 'Heart-broken all over again.'

            No, not to Bubby. One of her granddaughters is turning 31 this week! We'll be visiting Bubby over the weekend to celebrate with her. Plus, rumor is we're going to be baking hamentashins with her too. Now that's what Bubby calls a party. (By the way, if you need the recipe again,

            couldn't be more pleased to see Barack Obama become our new president. She was glued to CNN just like the rest of the world. Can you imagine how it must feel to be 93 and see such a pivotal moment in history??

             , we received a letter from a 25-year old woman living in Belgium who told Bubby she was planning to marry her boyfriend. She was looking for her first job after graduate school, but the only one available to her was far away in Paris. She wasn't excited about the job and didn't feel like it matched her qualifications. But she was afraid her parents would be mad if she didn't accept it.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Bubby wrote her wisely, "
             <em>
              It is a terrible feeling to get up in the morning and go to a job that you don't like or are not qualified for. Just give yourself more time to find the job for which you are trained and you are qualified."

            <br/>
            <span style="color:teal;">
             And then she added, "
             <em>
              Don't worry about your boyfriend. If you really love one another distance will not make a difference."
             </em>
             Bubby knows

              what long-distance love is like
             </a>
             ! And she knew there was a way to solve this problem if everyone sat down to talk about it. "
             <em>
              Put your thinking cap on!"
             </em>
             Bubby told her.
             <br/>
             <br/>

             , we received a great update letter. They were still happily in love and getting married! She did find another job that she was much happier with, even though it still meant geographical distance for the couple. But they visited each other every weekend, and spoke on the phone every day. She wrote, "
             <em>
              This is working, because we made it work, with lots of patience and love. Thanks for your nice advice to me when I asked for it... I'll send you another update for the wedding."

             Well, we're happy to report that she kept her word. This week we received another great update letter. She wrote:

              I am very happy to tell you that, due to my good job and good fortune, he was able to come join me in Paris to look for a job (which he found easily). We got married in April. We first met in 2003, and it was a difficult 5 years. We got through it, partly thanks to your advice.

             Dear Bubby,

            <br/>
            <strong>
             I'm a 17 year old girl and a senior in high school. I am a member of the softball team and this year I've been named captain!
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>

            <br/>
            <strong>
             This past Sunday something I never could have imagined happened... our assistant coach past away. The whole team is devastated. It was very sudden, he wasn't even sick. Now, every time our head coach looks at the team, he gets tears in his eyes.
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             As the captain, I feel it's my job to keep everyone in high spirit. I put on a brave face and act like everything's OK, but I just can't do it anymore. I need a shoulder to cry on too.
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             What can I say to my teammates to help them cope with this great lost without lying to myself? How can I help my head coach deal with losing his best friend?
            </strong>

            Dear
            <em>
             Team In Tears,
            </em>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Every person should allow for time to mourn. It's a very human need. You need to be patient with yourself. It's very kind of you to want to help your team.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In time, everyone's spirits will be revived and the memory of your coach will celebrated in team victories.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But for now, take time to cry, talk about your feeling, and share them with your teammates. Even if you tell them that "Everything is OK", it's all right to admit that it isn't right now.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Maybe you guys can do something in his honor, like raise money to help his family, or have a memorial service, or a candlelight vigil. Maybe everyone can share stories about him.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            There is a time for mourning, and a time for smiling.

Our daughter, who is 30 and single, has a 2 year old little girl, who we adore. My husband babysits 2 days a week and a babysitter comes in 3 other days. My husband and I want to sell our house and move to a retirement village in Florida so that we can spend our days in the sun, enjoying the rest of our life.

Also, my mother in law lives 3 houses away, is not well physically and would be horrified if we moved. She is also very attached to the baby.

             a touching letter from a man who had just lost his wife a few months earlier. It was a heart-breaking letter about love and loss and faith.

              To paraphrase, he asked her,
              <em>
               "...if God doesn't make mistakes, and if He has a plan for each of us, and if that plan is good, why [is my family] here eating a huge crap sandwich?"
              </em>
              Because he had two children to continue raising, he needed to know how to pick himself up again.

               had a lot to say.
              </a>
              First she emphasized, "
              <em>
               I know just how you feel because I have been in the same boat. For some time I could do nothing but feel sorry for myself."
              </em>
              And then she advised, "
              <em>
               Remember the wound heals but the scars remain and life goes on. I know I'm here and you will be too. Be a good loving father. Have courage and smile

              Hi. About 2 years ago, I remember asking you why God took my wife and left me and my kids alone. Well, now we are doing OK, and involved in new adventures. It is still sad, but bearable, and of course we still miss her. But life goes on, and I think the future will be OK too.

            I suggest you move to a country that is more tolerant so that you can have a life. A happy life. Homosexuality is not a disease, you are just born that way. It doesn't mean that something is wrong with you.

            People who are not educated well

            don't know how to be more accepting. Start accepting yourself first. You can still have a family and children, just maybe not where you are living now.
            <br/>

            Don't lose hope.

              I'd really really appreciate it if you gave me your wonderful advice on this particular situation that I'm in. I am sure that you get a ton of email from people around the world - but it would be amazing to get feedback from such a great lady.

              Fortunately for some—and unfortunately for others in high school, the junior prom is just around the corner. I know it's just one night and essentially just another school dance, but with added stress and more hype. (It all seems so shallow yet fun to me). I have the dress. I have the group of friends I'm going with. Just missing is my date.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Nervous to the point that I almost couldn't think, I asked a friend (who is a senior) to the prom, as friends. He was very kind about it... but said he couldn't go because he was visiting his sister somewhere. He told me "thanks for the invite" and suggested that I ask one of his friends.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Wow. This was like a small slap in the face. But it's life. And it happens.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Unfortunately one of my friends (a girl) had already asked (the
              <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">
               senior's
              </span>
              ) friend. Pretty much all of my girl friends have dates and I know it is my fault that I waited too long to ask that senior in the first place.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But along comes fate. In the face of a guy, who I'll call Joe, and who is looking for a date. I hear that he is planning on asking me. It is so exciting that someone is going to ask me to prom, but I don't really like Joe like a boyfriend...like I'm not attracted to him at all. He's not that bad looking, just really annoying sometimes. I hate to sound to shallow mean but I care too much about what other girls in my school would say and think. (Like "Oh she's too good for him" Or "she shouldn't settle").
              <br/>
              <br/>
              And I shouldn't care.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But I begin thinking that maybe all this stupid drama would not have happened if I had had a boyfriend. Maybe none of this rejection and awkwardness would not have

              . Maybe there's something wrong with me or something I did or did not do that causes me not to have a boyfriend.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I have lots of friends (guys and girls) in school and am active in many clubs and sports. I try (but not too hard) to be outgoing and positive but it seems all very fruitless at the moment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              So what went wrong? Will I ever find not just someone who I like, but some who likes me back?
              <br/>
              And is finding a boyfriend this hard in college? I hope not.

              I am 15, turning 16. I know I'm young but it is believed I am an "old soul". I believe in a lot of things the people around me don't even consider. However, I am haunted by a dark childhood. Many things have

              to me one of which has ripped me apart from my best friend, my mother. We have been apart for 3 years now with visits once or twice a week but it's not enough ever.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I have also been lost in interest. I used to do ballet, soccer, paint, write, read, everything. And the past two years have been empty of it, not because of lack of

              , but lack of interest. I am frustrated because I do not even have anything to lose myself in or vent through. I've been trying everything from belly dancing to guitar lessons and nothing seems to help. Everyone says it's gonna get better. They've been saying it since I was born.

             This will pass. And you are going to look back at the dark side of your life and you will be in control. In a few years you will be an adult and you will be able to make decisions and spend more time with your mother. Just hold on to it. It's going to be OK.

             Hey Bubby,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I've been asking my friends this question and been coming up with the same answer, but I wanted an outside opinion. I can't feel like I can really talk to my parents. And my grandparents aren't around anymore.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I want to be an animator. I'm very serious and passionate about art and this career choice. But my dad just doesn't seem to see that. I wish he could understand how I feel about what I do, but he doesn't.  Recently I've been talking to him about the idea of college, and I told him of this wonderful college outside of the state. He got really mad.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             He told me that he wasn't going to send me money outside of the state, because he didn't think I could handle the responsibility. I have an autistic brother that my mom and I take care of and my dad doesn't help at all. I do a lot around here, and get decent grades in school. I don't understand why he wouldn't think I'm responsible enough.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I'd do anything to get my dad's approval and lately I've been thinking of doing something else so that he's happy and proud of me.  Should I go through with not pursuing my career as an animator?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Sincerly,
             <br/>

            ,
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You should try to explain to your father what an animator does and show him examples of your work. Maybe once he knows what it entails, he'll learn to respect you and the work that you love to do. Find out exactly what he has against being an animator. Maybe he thinks you can't earn a living doing that. Tell him about people who work at Disney - they make a lot of money!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Get your education first. You're still young. You should explore all possibilities. If you are interested in art, then pursue a career in art. Just like my granddaughter.

             It's amazing to me that most Jewish people here don't know what a bubby is and call their grandmother's - grandma. It's amazing what you are doing with the blog.

             Thanks, Michael! This reminds us of a post we put up in July of 2006, regarding Bubby's yiddish moniker. Lots of people ask us about her name.
             <a href="http://helpmebubby.blogspot.com/2006/07/hi-bubby-im-mother-of-3-year-old-son.html">

             And then we received a cool letter from a woman who calls herself,
             <em>
              Lost and Hopeful.
             </em>
             She wrote to Bubby about a letter we posted in August of 2007. This is the first time we've recieved a letter from someone asking one of our readers to follow up (usually we have to do the asking!). Here is her question:

            <strong>
             Dear Bubby,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I've been reading your old letters, and I came across one that inspired me.
             <em>
              Lost Seeker
             </em>
             [Monday, August 28 2007] sounds a lot like me. I feel the exact same way as him. I was uninspired when I graduated, and have yet to pick a direction. I am also wondering about love, but that's another story.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I was actually wondering if I could find out how he's doing now? If he went in a particular direction? Maybe his story can help me. Could you ask me if he could give me some pointers? He just sounds like someone I'd like to speak to.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Thank you,
             <br/>

             I'm a 22-year-old male, and for the past 6 years I have been feeling more and more lost in life. I just finished college, majoring in science, and although I loved it at first, I ended college with no interest to pursue a career in the subject. I thought by this point in life, I would have my life sorted out a little more.
            </strong>

            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             Most people I know have figured out what they want to do with themselves, they know what type of occupation they want, and they are in long term relationships. Here I am, with no real direction in life, have never had a solid relationship, and no sure sign of one happening soon (or ever).
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             I've decided to take a year to travel around. I spent 2 months living in Spain, and will be returning to Europe shortly. I'm hoping that travel will help me learn a lot more about the world, about people, and about myself. And hopefully it will help me find some direction.
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             My question is: Does direction in life ever come?? How exactly does one find it? My current plan is to wander the planet until I find it. And true love? Does it really exist? Is there really a soul mate for everyone? Does life ever come together? I really need the advice of somebody who has been in the world long enough to know the nature of it better than I do.

            Dear
            <em>
             Lost Seeker

            ,
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I think maybe you don't give yourself enough time wherever it is you go. You should put down roots and get to know the people around you.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Take a job where there are lots of people. Maybe a large corporation. And you'll learn to deal with different personalities. Some will be good, some bad, some will have expectations and others will never get off the ground. And you should learn the difference.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Yes, there is a true soul mate. And you will find that it will find you. And one day without hunting, she'll be there. I know. Because I went through it.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Just wait and see. True love will come.

             Dear Bubby,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I discovered your website today and it's so good to know that somewhere in the world I can talk to a grandmother who would care of me. Unfortunately I never had talks with my own grandmothers. Sometimes I feel alone and I know my friends can't help me because they are too young. Sometimes I see an older woman in the street or in the bus and I wonder about the luck their grandchildren have.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I've always wanted to ask questions about love to someone I can trust and who has enough experiences.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I would like to know, according to all your experiences, if love can overcome everything? I think I am in love with someone. But, well, it's a girl. She has problems with drugs. I'm only 18 and people thinks it's stupid, but... This situation is probably absolutely crazy for you. I feel so lost and I just didn't know what to do.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I wish you an happy birthday and all the best. You are just wonderful.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             With a lot of love,
             <br/>
             <em>
              LuvGirl
             </em>
             <br/>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Dear
            <em>
             LuvGirl,
            </em>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            There's a lot more to it than just love. Is the person reliable? Is the person helpful? Is the person healthy? Of course if they are good looking and educated then that is much more agreeable. No need to worry about being good looking, there's always more to a person than a happy face. That goes along with it. But it is important to have a good heart.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If they have a strong will, anyone can overcome drugs. She has to put them away and get rid of them. That's very important. I don't know how she started doing them but she has to get rid of them once and for all. She can keep saying, "tomorrow" and "tomorrow" and "tomorrow" but that will make it worse. It takes a strong will.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She has to tell herself that enough is enough. I'm not going to take them anymore! I'm going to throw them all out and stay away from them forever and forever. The drugs would certainly shorten her life. It takes a strong will and only she knows how strong she is.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "Tomorrow" will never come. There is no end to tomorrows. There's always another tomorrow. I hope she throws them away. Maybe she had an unhappy life at home or broke up with her boyfriend or whatever. But you have to be a strong person.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Thank you for your sweet letter.

             Just for fun, we decided to post an old letter of Bubby's that to this day still remains... how shall we put this?... Relevant?

             Dear Bubby,
            </span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">
             I worry that GW Bush is the worst president the U.S. has ever had and that this is the most critical historical period the U.S. has ever been in.
            </span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">
             The combination of those two worries keeps me up at night. Now I have dark circles under my eyes and a permanent back ache, and I'm only 33.
            </span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">
             Since you've seen a lot more of life than I have, can you reassure me that things have been this bad before, or maybe even worse, and they got better? Where does a person find hope in the dark moments of life?
            </span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">
             Thanks,
            </span>
            <br/>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">
             Lily

            <br/>
            Dear Lily,
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img align="right" src="http://www.naavaonline.com/helpmebubby/noahsark.gif"/>
            Yes, Bush is the worst President we ever had. But we have had bad times and got through it. Do you listen to the programs on some of the political programs like CNN? Listen to as many as you can. I am a Democrat and that is the party of the people. I'm for Kerry and I would like to see Edwards as the No.2 man. I think they are both sincere and will try for the common people -- schools, health, jobs, etc.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Don't give up hope. This is your country and my country and is the best in the world. The trouble will dribble out and our men will come home. I lived through a few wars. Remember the storm is over and the sun shines again. Just like Noah and his ark. Trust in G-d. Keep your spirits high and do what's right.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Good Luck.

              I am 30 year old woman and live in Shiraz-Iran. I love my country but its pretty mail domination. Which means woman have little opportunity. To find husband, take care of kids, and be obedient is the most important things for woman in my country. I had one terrible marriage experience. My ex-husband was addicted to heroin and my mother in law was abusive person. how ever after 1 month I got divorce. In my country is not appropriate for woman to get divorce and I considered as not good woman just because I was sure it’s not right to share life with rubbish man….

            <p>
             After my divorce I decided to run my own business, I am planning to make nice coffee shop but my mother thinks it’s better for me to get married as soon as possible because I am aging.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I don’t want to repeat my bad experience, my mother is finding me proposal like 40 years old or older… but I am not really interested to marry some one who is older besides the point I am not emotionally ready after what had happen, I just want to focus on my job. Although we have lots of argue, she always does what she wants.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             How can I make her to listen to me? My mum was never a good listener at all….

             Dear
             <em>

             <br/>
             Nobody can tell you what to do with your life. You have to figure out what is good for you. Every person has a life and that person can decide what to do with that life. Do you want it to be good or do you want it to be bad? Whatever. You want to be well or do you want to be sick?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             To be good is best. It doesn't take any more energy to be well as it does to be sick and bad. To be good leaves you free to do what you want to do. You have to work hard. That's the important thing. Nobody gives it to you. You must do it yourself. It's as simple as that.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             First, you must get an education. When you have an education you are superior. You can always find someone your own age to marry (or a year or two older, or a year or two younger). You'll always find someone you can love and be married to, so I think your mother is wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to open a business, more power to you. You have to keep your eyes on the ball. It's not easy, but if you work hard, it comes to you. No question about it.

             Dear Bubby,

            <strong>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             I haven't been back to check this blog in a while, but every time I do come back, I am so happy to read all the wonderful advice Bubby has to give, and it's so wonderful to see how much love the granddaughters have for their Bubby.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Happy 91st birthday, bubby!  My bubby also turns 93 today, and I'm so glad to hear that your bubby is doing well.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I don't think I've ever written to this site for advice, but I started checking this blog out a few years ago when a long-term relationship ended and I was doing lots of thinking about relationships and love.  Bubby's kind words and wisdom were so supportive and smart.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Now I'm glad to give my own update.  I've been in a wonderful relationship with a very kind, sweet, and handsome man, and he is meeting with the jeweller today to arrange for my engagement ring!  It's so exciting to begin this new chapter of my life with someone I love so much.
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
            </strong>
            <br/>
            <strong>
             So Bubby, thank you for all your wisdom along the way.  Although it wasn't in direct response to me, you are helping so many people who not only write in with questions but read your advice and kind words.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Love,

            <br/>

            Just an update for those of you kind people who still write to Bubby...
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She's doing great! She still can't quite make it to her computer at this moment, so we are relying on alternative ways of getting her feedback onto the website (like hand-written notes, and audio recordings). So forgive the delay in posting. But she sends her regards to everyone, and says she is delighted to hear that you all still check her website daily.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            And, yes, we know all the images aren't showing up here as they usually do. We are having some technical difficulties with our hosting company, and expect to resolve that shortly.
            <br/>

               Bubby wanted to say hello to everyone and let you know how she's doing. She thanks you all for those kind birthday wishes (she's 91 now!) and has lots to say below. We continue to receive letters from everyone around the world on a daily basis and the stories that you share with us are truly touching. Thank you so much.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Since Bubby couldn't possibly respond to the hundreds of letters waiting her reply in her inbox (did we mention she's 91?), she thought she'd offer some generalized advice that speak to the issues most of you write to her about.

              <br/>
              For a long time I wasn’t well and was not able to get back to my friends through out the country. But now I’m feeling better and I want to acknowledge all my friends who are so kind to write to me. And I wish them all well. And I hope they will continue to write and tell me about all the things they have been doing. I’m feeling much better and I’ve been spending my time knitting a lot of scarves.

              First of all, you must love what you are doing. And you must decide what it is best for you. What interests you most? Because when you know what your interests are, you can develop a career. If you like to write, write a book. It can be a review of history, a love story, or a travel log from a vacation that you have had.

              When you have a difference with anyone in the family, don’t stop talking to them. Your anger just grows and grows. If you have a difference with a family member, you call that person and you talk it over. Because every problem has a solution.

              You don’t spend money you don’t have. Put it this way: You can charge. And when you get money at the end of the month, you pay all your bills. If you don’t pay all your bills one month, you have twice as many to pay the next month.

              Well, there are several ways of approaching religion. There are some people that are ultra religious, and there are a lot of do’s and don’ts. You must thank God for all the good things and be tolerant of all the sad things that happen in a life time.

              Well, the day I met my husband he was visiting a friend of his and he stopped to say hello on the way to the station. And I was there. My sister’s future mother-in-law invited me for dinner. And he sat down and had coffee and cake. And he looked at me and he said, pointing his finger at me, “I’m going to marry you.” And I said, “Oh the fortune teller told me I was going to be married twice.” And he said, “Well, I’m going to live with you the longest.” So I said, “We’ll find out.”

              My roommate was with me. And she said afterwards, that my eyes sparkled like a flirt. I was embarrassed.

              <br/>
              And then it was time for him to go to the station. He missed one train. And then he missed another train. And then we had to go because there was only one more train to

              . And we walked him to the station, and he said, “Is it OK if I write to you? Will you answer me?” And I said, “If you want to.” And then the next day I got a letter. And then day after, I got another letter. And the day after, I got another letter. And everyday I got a letter from him. 215 letters. I think I still have a couple. So I answered him. But if I skipped a day, he would call me.

              I was also seeing another boy at the time. His uncle was a doctor and he came from a comfortable family, because he had his own car, which was a big deal. When he drove he only wanted me sit up very close to him in the car.

              But when one of the girl’s in the sorority told him I had a boyfriend, he asked me if that was true. I said, “Well, I don’t know if I’d call him a boyfriend, but I see him a lot.” And that boy said, “Well, to me that sounds like a boyfriend.”

             I know how you feel to be forgotten on your birthday by your husband but two wrongs do not make a right.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I would send him a card with nothing on it for one thing and a gift box with nothing in it. And if he says anything I would remind him of what he did to me.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             And then I would say that now that we have both had our says -- Let's go out and celebrate for both of us. And I bet next year he will not forget at all.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Have a good time. Remember, there are forgetful moments in every life time. Let this be the last in yours.

             , we posted a letter to Bubby from "Upset Girl". She was a 24-year old, recently graduated, hopelessly-in-love young woman. Imagine that. Problem was, her boyfriend the programmer never thought about marriage. And guess what, you'll never believe it: She did! A lot. She thought about what a good husband he would make, how good of a provider he would be, how well he would continue to treat her...
             <br/>
             <br/>
             But when a girl thinks about those things, A LOT, and the boyfriend does not think about those things, like, EVER... Well, a girl starts to get upset. And a girl writes to Bubby asking what she should do. And Bubby writes back, saying, "
             <span style="font-style: italic;">
              Don't push it. If you push it, it will be over. Young men are fragile. Be smart, and you will win.
             </span>
             "
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Fragile? Young men are fragile? Well, we had no idea. See, you can learn something new from Bubby everyday! Now it's a few months later, and we were wondering, has "Upset Girl" pushed boyfriend over the edge, or has he found his footing and set the date? OR.... has something entirely different happened?

This relationship had taken over  my whole world but faced a bitter truth. I have detached emotionally with him  and right now I don't know what I can do with the rest of our relationship. He  doesn't have any problem with continuing our relationship but I am franticÂ how  can I believe that

             <br/>
             Sorry for the lack of posts and activity on the site for a while. Bubby is OK, just not up to writing lately (supposedly you're allowed to "take it easy" in life once you turn 90!). She still loves hearing from all of you, and receiving such warm accolades about the work she's done on this site for over 4 years!
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Until she's back into the swing of things, we'd like to continue to share Bubby-related info with you. And today we have a new update! We love getting these from you, and according to
             <a href="http://www.helpmebubby.com/bubbypoll.html">

            On September 17, 2005, we posted a letter from a young girl called, "
            <a href="http://helpmebubby.blogspot.com/2005/09/dear-bubby-i-am-only-in-9th-grade-but.html">
             Ready to Change
            </a>
            ". She wrote to Bubby with a sad heart. Only in 9th grade, she was nearly 200 pounds. She wanted to be healthy, she wanted to stay motivated to loose the weight, she wanted to stop feeling jealous of "skinny people". But it was tough. She asked Bubby what she should do.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Bubby is quite a health-conscious grandma, and quickly told our young reader that she should go see a nutritionist. She wrote, "
            <em>
             He or she will take some tests and put you on a very special diet. You MUST follow it implicitly
            </em>
            ." She warned our reader about the health risks of her condition such as high blood pressure, or diabetes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Bubby concluded, "
            <em>
             If you want to live to a right old age you must take care of yourself now... You will be able to enjoy life as you should at your age
            </em>
            ."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We were so happy to hear from
            <em>
             Ready To Change
            </em>
            one year later. She had a wonderful update to share with everyone.

            <strong>
             Dear Bubby,
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I sent you a letter over a year ago, going into ninth grade. At the time I felt really fat, and unloved. After getting your reply, I joined the swim team. I absolutely loved that experience. I wasn't a varsity swimmer, but I learned to develop my swimming skills. Our team was first in our league that year.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             That school year I was the editor for my school yearbook and on the National Honor Society executive board. It was so fun interacting with all these athletes from my school (the school that I go to is really big on sports) while working on the yearbook and knowing that I was an athlete too.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Then, in the spring I took a risk and joined the high school Water Polo team. Water polo is my favorite sport, it is such an intense, fun game.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Near the end of the season, I took up running. I felt so powerful and in control. I wouldn't have done that last year, but I love running now. Now I am back on the swim team, and I'm really only a couple of seconds away from varsity.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I love myself, and I love hanging out with others. I feel like my life has made a huge change since then.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Thank You!

           A few years ago we introduced her to the internet and we've been getting daily e-mails from her ever since.  When she was 87, we began this website.  
 We now believe she is the
           <b>
            oldest blogger on the Internet.

           Whether Bubby is reminding us that boyfriends do not substitute for warm jackets in the winter, or that it's 
 better to receive a compliment than a brick, she always has
           <a href="http://helpmebubby.blogspot.com/2008/03/blog-post.html">
            something to say
           </a>
           to her granddaughters.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now with this new website, Bubby can finally share her wisdom with the rest of the world.  
 And she's excited about it!
 (Which confuses us, because she used to say we were all she needed.)

           Hopefully this will be as much fun for new readers as it will surely be for her.
 And if not, well, as Bubby says, it will all come out in the wash.
