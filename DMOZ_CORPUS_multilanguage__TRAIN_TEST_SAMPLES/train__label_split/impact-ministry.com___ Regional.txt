       Welcome to Impact Ministry.

       A special welcome from Bobby G. Richardson. Thanks for stopping by. It is our desire that you will look around, and be inspired and edified as a result.

       At one time, I was a backslider on a fast track to destruction and I knew it. However, on the evening of December 10, 1985 God used a little lady in Port Sulphur, Louisiana to witness to me, and have prayer with me. That act of obedience on her part brought about a strong sense of conviction and condemnation on my part. I left Port Sulphur right after that. And, God started dealing with me as soon as I got on the highway. As I drove and considered my spiritual condition, I thought it would take a transitional period of months or years to make my way back to God. However, God gave me my "last call" while driving from Pt. Suphur, Louisiana to Brookhaven, Mississippi. After miles of weeping, praying and repenting, I stopped at Mile Marker 7 on I-55 in south Mississippi, and buried a lot of failures, excess baggage and returned to God as the Prodigal Son (

       ). I moved my family to Central Florida in 1986, and went through what I refer to as a 15 year "spiritual boot camp". During that time we lived in Kissimmee, Belleview and Davenport. In 1998 I bought a new computer and started a few plain Jane web pages in AOL's Hometown Community, which I had put up myself. Later, they became Impact-Ministry.com which was put together by my dear friend and brother in the Lord, Bro. Ron Elmore. My on line Bible Study is called, "

       </a>
       ", and for several years it has been ranked #1 on Google, Yahoo and MSN for "non-denominational bible study" searchs and I give God all of the glory, honor and praise.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In 2001, I returned to my old stomping ground in rural Mississippi, where I maintain my calling of non-denominational lay work. Currently, I teach, sing and play guitar at the First Apostolic Church of Bogue Chitto. In early 2009, Pastor Jack Roberson, myself and Bill Jones formed a bluegrass gospel band "

       ". We've played and sang at a senior's dinner at a neigboring church, a retirement reunion for a friend in the community, a soup and cornbread supper at the local lodge. Things are looking very good as God continues to bless.

       Our services are not professional productions designed to draw a 
 crowd. Instead, spontaneous, heart felt worship is what you will find. Jesus said in 
 John 4:23, ... the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the 
 Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

       Come see if we arent the friendliest Church youve ever seen, and our services to be as 
 refreshing as an oasis in the desert. Pastor Davidson and our entire church family extends 
 to you a very warm and cordial welcome.
