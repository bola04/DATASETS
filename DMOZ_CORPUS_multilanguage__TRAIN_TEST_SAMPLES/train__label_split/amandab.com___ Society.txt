            Amanda's
     "Quick" Biography
           </big>
          </big>
         </p>
         <p>
          Amanda was born on the morning of December 8, 1986 at Langlade Memorial Hospital in
     Antigo, Wisconsin. Amanda was delivered in a 10 minute emergency C-Section because she was
     in the wrong position. She was born 6 weeks prematurely and only weighed 5 pounds.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amanda died on March 16, 1999, after succumbing to carbon monoxide gas. She was
     transported from Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to Hennepin County
     Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, via MedEvac helicopter. There she was treated in
     a hyperbaric chamber to remove the carbon monoxide from her blood. Although the treatement
     was successful, Amanda had been without oxygen for too long. She was pronounced dead at
     7:00 pm. Amanda had wanted to be an organ donor, but blood tests showed that it would not
     be possible for her to donate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amanda will always be remembered as a happy, smiling girl, who cared for the little
     things in life. Although she enjoyed doing her best and excelling academically, she was
     equally happy playing with and helping her brothers and sister. She was very thoughful and
     sensitive, and cried when touched by a good movie or book.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amanda accepted Jesus Christ as her personal Savior, and trusted Him to lead and guide
     in her life. She learned of her need for salvation through reading a tract, then wrote her
     name on the tract after she had prayed and accepted the gift of salvation. She would have
     wanted you to know this.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amanda described herself in a STAND (Students Taking Action Not Drugs) essay:

          <strong>
           <big>
            <em>
             "I spend most of my time singing. I love to sing: it's something
     I think about a lot. I also play soccer and basketball. I love reading, spelling, language
     and math. I have 2 brothers, 1 sister, 4 cats, 2 dirt bikes, 1 go-cart, and huge yard and
     a big house. I also like drama. It's easy for me to act and pretend that I'm sleeping,
     working, reading, listening, thinking, crying, hurt, daydreaming, or blind and deaf."
