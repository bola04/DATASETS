          7th World Summit of Culture and Arts
         </a>

         Over 400 delegates from 80 countries attended the 7th World Summit on Arts and Culture. The Center for Promotion of Intercultural Dialogue was represented by its President, Mr. Mihai Valentin Vladimirescu.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.mihaivladimirescu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WorldSummitArtsCulture-800x286.jpg">
          <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1432" height="107" src="http://www.mihaivladimirescu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WorldSummitArtsCulture-800x286-300x107.jpg" title="WorldSummitArtsCulture-800x286" width="300"/>

         The 2016 Summit was held in Malta – a country situated in the heart of the Mediterranean, always found at the crossroads, where cultures have been meeting and interacting throughout history. The Summit explored changing perceptions of leadership and address a number of questions: What are the issues? How are decisions being made, and by whom? How is leadership defined in different cultures? How can governments and civil society collaborate? And where do we go from here?
        </p>
        <p>
         The focus of the 2016 World Summit on Arts and Culture was on Cultural Leadership in the 21st Century. The arts and culture can be considered to be at a crossroads – faced with many challenges and opportunities at the global, national and local level such as: the impact of new technologies on the production and distribution of cultural goods and services; threats to global security; new patterns of migration; changing contexts at the national level including austerity measures and continuous requests for reform; aspirations from artists and culture operators to extend their impact and outreach to other sectors, while also struggling to guarantee freedom of expression and ensure cultural diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cultural leadership which understands and takes into account the changing realities of today’s world becomes fundamental for ensuring that the arts and culture are seen as pillars of social development in the 21st century. New models of cultural leadership are more important than ever as we work to affirm the arts and culture as pillars of social development. At a time when the notion of participatory governance is prevalent, no decision can be made without the involvement of multiple stakeholders, and the tradition of top-down leadership is no longer the only model. Artists, networks, advocacy groups, and professional organisations play an increasingly important role in engaging people, debating the issues, and proposing solutions to the challenges of our times.

        <p>
         President of the Centre for Promotion of Intercultural Dialogue, Prof. Dr. Mihai Vladimirescu attended the 7th Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, in Baku, Republic of Azerbaijan, on 26-27 April 2016, with theme: “Living Together In Inclusive Societies: A Challenge and A Goal.”The Global Forum is the highest-profile event of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, bringing together prominent personalities, current and potential partners, and others from different sectors. 3000 representatives of more than 140 countries attended the Forum.
         <br/>
         At Forum’s opening ceremony participated President of Azerbaijan, Mr Ilham Aliyev, the Turkish President, Mr Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the High Representative of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, Mr Nasser Bin Abdulaziz Al-Nasser and a host of ministers of foreign affairs, culture and religious affairs and official personalities representing countries, international and regional organizations, private sector companies, civil society, youth organizations, technical bodies, the media, and international donors.
         <br/>
         Delivering the inaugural speech, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev emphasised the role of UNAOC on the issues of dialogue, understanding, tolerance and co-existence between cultures and religions. He also confirmed his country’s support for each of these values that it believes in.
         <br/>
         The Azerbaijani president underlined that security, peace, tolerance and co-existence are the principles for understanding among peoples, which require the support of everyone in this regard for the alliance and for the establishment of new foundations for peace. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed the important role UNAOC plays in carrying out the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind and addressing the root causes of violent extremism and terrorism. Division and exclusion only play into the hands of the extremists, but what they really want to destroy is our common ground, he stressed. “Stereotyping is dangerous and destabilising. Sensationalism may sell papers, but it does not solve problems,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
         The forum is aimed at promoting the Alliance of Civilizations initiative as a platform for materializing the “Living Together in Inclusive Societies” concept, creating new partnerships between the Alliance of Civilizations and institutions sharing its goals, and launching the UNAOC Advisory Council.
         <br/>
         The forum is deemed very important as it is aimed at achieving the goals set by the previous UNOAC Fora held in Madrid, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Doha, Vienna and Bali, namely promoting peace, boosting communities development through intercultural and intercivilizational dialogue, fostering world peace and security, and combining the accomplishments of the UNAOC and the Millennium Development Goals.
