           December, 2011: This site now has all the materials for the book: title pages and a table of contents, seven Symposium papers, abstracts of the rest, an Appendix containing the exhibition catalogue, and and Index. The papers and the appendix are individually paginated at the top of each page, with the book pagination at the bottom. Removal of one paper necessitated repaginating the book. Final checking continues. Please let us know of any errors you find in the index.

         Deborah Brown, the Byzantine Librarian at Dumbarton Oaks, very kindly volunteered to see to getting the book catalogued. We hope to get copies to her around the beginning of the year. We will print very few copies, giving them to libraries.

        After that, although the basic text will not change, we will continue to note corrections  here if necessary. We expect to add one more paper, whcih will appear in another book but also on line here. Other additions, e.g. of more images if appropriate, may also occur.
