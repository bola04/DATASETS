       <h1>
        Welcome to John Jackson &amp; Dick
       </h1>
       <img alt="Meet the team" class="img-left" src="images/welcomeIMG1A.png"/>
       <p>
        Measured against international and national law firms with hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyers, we are a small firm.  However, we are different from most provincial law firms of comparable size.  While we continue to provide the all-round services traditionally expected of general practice law firms in Scotland - residential conveyancing, estate agency, letting, wills, trusts &amp; executries, divorce and family law, civil court, etc. - we have long had an extra dimension in providing company and commercial law services at a level normally only available from much larger city firms.  We transact constantly with major corporate law firms, and we have to ensure that our expertise, quality and speed of service, and technology measure up to theirs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Buying and selling businesses, companies and commercial properties, and advising our commercial clients on their varied problems, is a large part of our business. We are privileged to act for many substantial, successful companies and owner-managed businesses.  They demand, and we provide, quality service, good communications and accessibility, sound technical law without unnecessary over-complication, and practical, commercial thinking.
       </p>
       <p>
        The same thorough, progressive approach applies to all parts of our services, for which we have built a reputation over more than 80 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        We keep our technology very up-to-date and encourage training and specialisation to ensure we provide quality advice and service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our range of services is wide, sufficient for most private clients and even fairly substantial businesses.  You will find further information on other pages.
       </p>
       <p>
        We hope that you’ll find our approach to be relaxed and friendly, with an emphasis on accessibility to our Directors and senior solicitors, and good communications with our clients, but at the same time competent and professional.
       </p>
