             With Eco Tan self tanning products, baking under the sun is fast becoming a less popular skin tanning alternative. The harmful UV rays and higher skin cancer risk should be more than enough motivation for you to abandon those extended hours of bathing under the sun at the beach. You can now get a naturally radiant tan with organic self tanning offerings by Eco Tan. If you’re not yet convinced that Eco Tan delivers, here are some reasons why you should give the products a try!
            </span>
           </p>
           <ul>

             You can only get
             <a href="https://lovethyself.com.au/brands/eco-tan/">
              <strong>
               organic fake tan from Eco Tan
              </strong>
             </a>
             . Why? It’s one of the few companies that utilize the power of organic ingredients to give users “natural” fake tan like no other. Traditional tanning solutions contain artificial dyes, synthetic coloring ingredients, and vomit-inducing chemicals that give them those nasty scents.   On the other hand, Eco Tan strives to produce sunless tanning options that are not only aesthetically pleasing but beneficial to the skin, too!
            </span>
           </p>
           <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
             For instance, Eco Tan Winter Skin is a powerful, all-natural product that helps darken a few shades with the use of aloe vera, cacao, grape skin, rose geranium, and chamomile. A few applications of Winter Skin will help you build the tan of your dreams without side effects and  health complications.
            </span>
           </p>
           <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
             The best selling Eco Tan Invisible Tan is a tanning lotion that delivers a healthy and glowing bronze skin in 8 hours or even less!
            </span>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">

              Fast and Easy Tan with Eco Tan

           </ul>
           <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
             The Eco Tan spray tan method is far different from that of traditional tanning salons and products. The gentle formulations by Eco Tan are not the only reason why they’re selling hot like pancakes all year long. Their self tanning products are easy to apply and easier to remove, too! if you want to revert to your original skin shade, the company also sells Pink Himalayan Salt Scrub for a gentle and easy tan removal at home.

           </p>
           <p>
            Generally speaking, facial skin care products can be put into five main categories. There may be some overlap among these categories, but each one serves a distinct purpose and understanding what each one does will help you to take care of your skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             1. Moisturizers:
            </strong>
            Skin is one of the first things people use to guess your age. Smooth looking skin is healthy and youthful looking skin, and it’s moisturizers that make this happen. The reason is that skin is more elastic in nature when you are younger, but it starts to lose its elasticity as you grow older. Keeping your skin properly hydrated with moisturizers helps to restore that elasticity, and as a result, leads to younger looking skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             2. Cleansers:
            </strong>
            You need to be especially careful when it comes to facial cleansers. The skin on the face is more delicate than other parts of the body, so you don’t want to use a harsh cleanser that could only make things worse. There are cheap cleansers and there are expensive cleansers, but price alone isn’t what determines how well a cleanser will work for you. The first step is knowing your skin type and then getting a cleanser that is formulated for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             3. Toners:
            </strong>
            The next category of facial skin care products are toners. These help to make face feel refreshed by adding some additional cleansing and by shrinking the pores. Be sure to choose a toner that doesn’t contain alcohol as it dries out the skin. Witch hazel and rose water are simple and effective toners. Many people prefer to apply their moisturizer after the toner because the toner may take some of the moisturizer off. However, toning also makes the pores smaller, thereby preventing the moisturizer from doing its full job. You may have to experiment to decide which way works best for you.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             4. Exfoliants:
            </strong>
            Your skin is constantly producing new cells to replace the dead ones. Unfortunately, these dead skin cells stay on the very top of the skin and can give your face a dull or aged look. Exfoliating is the process of removing these cells and there are many exfoliants to accomplish this. Exfoliants can be divided into two main categories: chemical and mechanical. Chemical exfoliants typically use acids of some kind to remove the dead skin cells. Some people are sensitive to these chemicals so they may not be a good choice for you, at least not for use on a regular basis. Mechanical exfoliants basically scrub away the dead skin cells with an abrasive. The key here is to use a as gentle of an abrasive as you can because you wouldn’t your facial skin products to end up damaging your skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             5. Sunscreen:
            </strong>
            We need plenty of sunlight to stay healthy, but the sun’s rays can take their toll on your skin. Put on sunscreen every time you go outside and you will minimize the harmful effects of the sun. You can buy sunscreen by itself, or select facial skin care products that have sunscreen added to them.

           </p>
           <p>
            Ever thought of experimenting with your own natural skin care recipes to combat that dry flaky skin?
            <br/>
            You have to know that skin basically does everything alone. This means that it can produce enough oil from the sebaceous glands to make it shine and work together perfectly. The problems appear when it becomes dry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keeping this in mind there are several solutions you can apply using ingredients already found inside your home or at the local grocery shop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that what you eat is very important and bad diets or insufficient nutritional ingredients damage every part of the body. To be healthy and have perfect skin a balanced diet is the first factor that has to be taken into consideration. Perfect glowing skin can be achieved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you heard of proteins? Well, they are very important for one’s skin regeneration and repair. Processed food rich in preservatives and salt will take moisture out of your skin. They can also cause the dreaded dry skin everybody is afraid of. Why not eat fish (salmon is the best), turkey, chicken or include in your diet vegetable protein? The all hated vegetables! They contain vegetal protein which is perfect for the body. Avoid frozen food! Vegetables are especially good if fresh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why not include in your natural skin care recipes ingredients such as garlic, onions or eggs? The contain Sulfur in a natural form and this substance is very important for the skin. Several multi-vitamins out there also contain sulfur and should be taken into account if your diet is lacking it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is your skin cracked? Have you considered being careful that your body receives enough vitamins A and B? Lacks of them cause this. Include in your diet food that contains these vitamins and eat carrots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beta-Carotene can be found in them and it’s good not only for your eyes. It plays a significant role in skin care as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you also have to include in your diets number:
           </p>
           <p>
            * Alpha-Hydroxy acids
            <br/>
            * EFAs (Essential Fatty Acids)
            <br/>
            * Lactic Acid
            <br/>
            * Supplements
            <br/>
            * Vitamin E
            <br/>
            * Aloe Vera
           </p>
           <p>
            Another important rule is: Avoid Junk Food! It is simply not good for you from all point of views.
           </p>
           <p>
            Natural skin care recipes are available everywhere. Some work, some don’t! The best method of choosing one is to ask friends that use them. Also keep in mind that what works for somebody may not work on you! Don’t be discouraged and keep trying.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best way to keep your skin perfect is by eating healthy and give your body every vitamin and mineral it needs. In most cases there is no need of expensive creams or lotions. A good moisturizer can replace them all if combined with a healthy way of eating.

            If you discover that you have oily skin, you may want to look into using a different facial soap. There are many types of facial soap on the market and many are especially for oily skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allouette has a clarifying facial wash that is good to use if you have oily skin. This facial wash is made for a person with oily skin, especially skin that is affected by acne. This facial wash is good for the cleansing of pores so those pools of oil do not from your face. It will also treat things such as blackheads and whiteheads that appear with the advent of oily skin. You can lift the dirt and oil out of your skin and the facial wash will also hydrate the dermal layer on your skin. The dirt is removed with both Alpha and Beta hydroxides, as they will gently remove dirty and oily skin cells and will not damage the underneath layers of skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are looking for a natural soap than Burt’s Bees Garden Tomato Complexion Soap for Oily Skin is just what you are looking for. This soap is made from natural ingredients, foremost being tomatoes. Tomatoes are a natural source of both AHA’a and lipocene. Both of these chemicals can help balance your pH level in your skin. This soap also has a toning effect and help with large pores. This is one of the better products to use for oily skin if you are wary about too many chemicals in your soaps.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the more trusted names in cleansing products is Neutrogena. Their Dermatological Bar Soap has hypoallergenic properties. This is a good aspect of the soap, especially for people that have sensitive skin. The Dermatological Bar Soap is one of the more popular products with consumers as it really works in clearing pores and helping people with oily skin. There are many unnatural chemicals in this bar soap and if you are wary of that try another cleanser.
           </p>
           <p>
            L’Oreal has a great answer for oily skin with their HydraFresh Gel Cleanser. This cleanser is great to use with many types of skin conditions, especially oily skin. There are no irritating effects with this cleanser and it is great at clearing your pores. The one main drawback is that if you want the maximum effect you have to purchase other L’Oreal products. This can get expensive but L’Oreal’s products do work if you have oily skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clinique Derma White Purifying Bar is another option to get rid of oily skin and is one of the more gentle facial cleansers. This soap is great for both oily skin as well as combination skin. Clinique is also one of the most trusted brands when it comes to skin care. This soap will remove dirt and oil from your skin and also moisturize your skin. It will give you a clean and clear complexion and also make your skin healthier.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also other natural remedies you can take if you want to combat oily skin. One of the main natural remedies that many physicians recommend is a mudpack. Mudpacks will draw out skin impurities and oil leaving you with healthier skin. You can feel a good mudpack working as your skin will feel great afterwards. The darker the mudpack is the better it will be at drawing out the oils in your skin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever you use to get rid of oily skin, make sure that afterwards you keep cleansing your skin so it does not return. If you are still having problems with oily skin after using products such as these, you should consult a physician.

            One of the great benefits of sauna and steam baths are the toning effects on the skin. They leave the skin soft, supple and glowing – in short, beautiful. Regular users of sauna and steam baths have an appealing healthy glow about them that adds to their attractiveness.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason that sauna and steam are so good for the skin is the deep cleaning action caused by heavy perspiration. The pores open wide and all the accumulated dirt can be easily washed out.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best benefits for skin toning come from full body sauna, but for those looking for a quick fix-up to their complexion can get similar results from facial sauna systems. These ‘mini-saunas’ are designed to apply steam to the face for the same deep cleaning action as a full sauna or steam bath.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             How They Work
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A facial sauna has an electric heating element on the bottom of the unit. It heats the water (which is held in a small reservoir) to the boiling point, causing the steam to rise. The small size of the reservoir ensures that steam is quickly produced.
           </p>
           <p>
            An ergonomically designed mask is placed over the reservoir to capture and funnel the steam to your face. You can control the amount of steam that your face is exposed to by the distance of the mask to your face.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bringing your face into direct contact with the mask gives the maximum deep cleaning action, but this position should only be used for a few moments at a time. After about 10 seconds, raise your head to allow cooler air to be mixed with steam. Repeat this cycle as many times as needed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Facial saunas are not only for deep cleansing the skin; they are also useful for unclogging stuffed sinuses. Anyone with a simple cold or a more serious condition like bronchitis, sinusitis, asthma and hay fever can use the facial sauna as an inhaler or vaporizer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some facial saunas have a separate inhaler attachment. Instead of fitting over the entire face, the inhaler attachment fits over the nose and mouth. Simply breathe in the steam to provide almost instant relief from sinus pain.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Operating Tips
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Most facial saunas have a very small reservoir so that the water can heat up fast. The downside of this is that the water evaporates quickly, so if you wish to use the sauna for an extended session, you should keep a tall glass of water by your side. This way, you can quickly refill the reservoir when it goes dry.
           </p>
           <p>
            The small reservoir, unfortunately, also means that the facial sauna cannot be used as an overnight vaporizer. If your sinuses are keeping you awake at night, you would be better off with a traditional vaporizer that provides steam for several hours.

            Steam is great for deep cleaning the skin, but for an additional beauty treatment you can add special cleaners such as tea tree oil to the water. Just a few drops of this oil will give your skin an even brighter glow and leave it feeling fresh and supple.

            Facial saunas are relatively inexpensive — usually less than $60. For this price, almost everybody can enjoy the deep cleaning action and the special ‘glowing’ skin that marks regular sauna users apart from the crowd.
