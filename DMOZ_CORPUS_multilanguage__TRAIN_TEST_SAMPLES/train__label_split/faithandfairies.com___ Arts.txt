           about long ago societies, or worlds very different from our own. It's 
           the story of several teenage boys who enter a magical world that becomes 
           more interesting page after page.

           My perspective therefore, is from the point of view of a literary critic... 
           You make wonderful use of 'mixed' mythological traditions. I like the 
           references to Greek/Roman (in terms of 'dryads'), Northern or Teutonic 
           ('trolls', the 'Father Tree'—which reminded me of the World Tree 
           'Ygdrassil' in northern myth), Celtic (the Great Stag) and what I interpreted 
           as 'New Age' mystical references (I recall the use of 'crystals' etc.). 
           I find this intriguing. While such techniques have been used before, 
           you have a fresh way of handling them.
