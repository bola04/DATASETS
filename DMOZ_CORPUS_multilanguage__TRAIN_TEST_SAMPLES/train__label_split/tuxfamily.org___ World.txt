        <p>
         If you read our news, it is very likely that you have some form of
 interest for information technologies and as such, it is equally
 likely you heard about the infamous Intel vulnerabilities known
 as
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">
          Spectre
         </a>
         and
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)">
          Meltdown
         </a>
         along with the tremendous cohort of processors they impact.
        </p>
        <p>
         Needless to say, TuxFamily had a look at these issues in particular.
 And, like many other companies and associations, we wondered
 "what's next?". After all, despite their well-deserved media coverage,
 Spectre and Meltdown are but successors to
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer">
          row hammer
         </a>
         and
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine#SA-00086">
          INTEL-SA-00086
         </a>
         and surely, things cannot end here, right? It felt natural to
 conclude that we have recently entered some form of dark period,
 the extent of which ought to be counted in years, characterised by
 a strong focus of all security-related I.T. professionals on hardware
 vulnerabilities. Basically, everything we discovered (vulnerabilities),
 learnt, improved and strove to prevent (good design and coding
 practices, security audits, peer reviews, etc.) in the latest 20 years
 is to be done again in the realm of hardware. Another way to put it is:
 one way or another, we are probably going to be betrayed by every
 existing piece of I.T. hardware in the coming years. It would be
 tempting to detail what would (and hopefully will) put an end to this
 era of misery, but this is not the point of this piece of news.
        </p>
        <p>
         The main point is: TuxFamily is moving out of x86 processors. For
 various reasons, we cannot afford to wait until every piece of
 hardware was deemed a threat to our mutualised infrastructure.
 Instead, we have to move on, even if that implies to design our own
 machines. And guess what? This is exactly what we intend to do, thanks
 to our main sysadmin also being a professional electronics engineer.
 After further investigations about what sounded like a crazy idea at
 first, we eventually found the perfect brick to start building the
 perfect architecture TuxFamily had never dared to dream about.
 And this brick happens to be... the glorious
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_LPC_Speech_Chips">
          TMS5100
         </a>
         !
        </p>
        <p>
         Surely, we do not expect all of our beloved hostees to react to that
 technical name. But we surely expect our plan to suddenly make a lot
 more sense after we rephrase it this way: we intend to rebuild
 TuxFamily's infrastructures based on
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)">
          Speak &amp; Spell
         </a>
         devices!

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Think about it: thanks to their simple design (no notion of rings, no
 fancy MMU, etc.), not a single hardware vulnerability has ever been
 registered for these chips. That's right, not a single human ever
 had to utter "ah, crap, we have to handle the TMS5100 F00F bug
 ASAP". THAT is what we call "reliable foundations".
        </p>
        <p>
         And this is where we need you! As of today, all of this remains a
 theoretical project; we are light-years, if not parsecs, away from our
 goal. To bootstrap this engineering endeavour, we do not need money
 (we still have plenty since the association officially moved to the
 Cayman islands) but we need a total of 3,261 Speak &amp; Spell devices.
 Alas, we only have 1 for the moment (well, technically, we have two,
 but a member of the staff refused to let go of his device, claiming
 it was sacred and he was still using it on a daily basis and we had
 no right to take it by force and we would have to write our damn
 news ourselves if we did so). We have no doubt that some of you still
 have such devices in their basement and are willing to help us achieve
 hardware independence. Therefore, please quickly mail us your
 Speak &amp; Spell devices to the following address:
        </p>

         Serge, our favourite intern, will be in charge of receiving, checking,
 registering, labelling, storing and/or dispatching the precious devices.
 All languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese) and
 variants (e.g.
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Read">
          Speak &amp; Read

          Speak &amp; Math
         </a>
         )
 are accepted, and all donators will receive weekly updates reflecting our
 march towards a better future. Do not hesitate, donate now!
        </p>
        <p>
         With your help, we should be able to replace our infrastructures in a
 matter of just a few years. Of course, hostees should expect a
 transition period marked by very slight losses of performance compared
 to the current infrastructure. But surely, this almost painless
 transition should be long buried and forgotten by the time the I.T.
 hardware industry put their products back on track with regards to
 security.

         <strong>
          Edit:
         </strong>
         as many of you had guessed, it was of course our traditional April Fools'
 	prank.
 	As severe as hardware vulnerabilities can be, we are too lazy to design and
 	build our own hardware and therefore do not actually need your
 	Speak &amp; Spell devices.
 	If by chance you insist on sending us your Speak &amp; Spell,
 	please contact us to get our actual postal address; indeed, the one
 	mentioned above is based on Santa Claus' postal address (the French variant
 	transposed in Paris to be specific) and none of you wants to mess with Santa's
 	after-sales service, right?
