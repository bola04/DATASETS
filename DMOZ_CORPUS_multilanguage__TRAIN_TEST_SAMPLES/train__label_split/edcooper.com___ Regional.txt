         is the story of a pioneering climber with a 
       passion for, and lifetime dedication to, the majestic mountains of North 
       America. First conquering the awesome faces and peaks-many of them 
       previously unclimbed-then photographing them with an intimate eye, Ed 
       Cooper has maintained this love affair with the mountains for more than 
       fifty years.
         <p>
          His unique story evokes the now-legendary early days of mountaineering 
       and includes exclusive first-hand accounts by climbers of that era about 
       many of the first ascents of new routes that have since become top 
       destinations for new generations of climbers. These historic ascents 
       include routes in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State; the "Chief," 
       near Squamish, British Columbia; the Bugaboos, also in B.C.; and El 
       Capitan in Yosemite Valley, California. These ascents were all achieved in 
       the 1950s and early 1960s at a time when climbing standards were rising 
       dramatically.
         </p>
         <p>
          Fascinated by the challenge of the heights, Ed Cooper became the first 
       "climbing bum" in the Pacific Northwest, where he rapidly acquired a 
       reputation as one of the most important all-around climbers of his 
       generation. This book provides rare insight into the world of 
       mountaineering and rock climbing during that era, revealing the intensely 
       competitive nature of the sport at a time when so many opportunities were 
       available for carving a place in climbing history as the first to complete 
       a new challenge.
         </p>
         <p>
          The young climber's evolving quest to photograph 
       the essence of the mountains he held in such awe resulted in a series of 
       spectacular portraits of many of the best-known peaks of North America. 
       These images provide the visual drama in Ed Cooper's story, which also 
       contains many historically interesting photos
          <br/>
          of 
       early climbs, and of such noted mountain personalities as Norman Clyde, 
       Warren Harding, and Galen Rowell.

     I want to take this opportunity to comment on a particular passage in the book which appears on 
 Page 95. I was quoting from the daily journal Mike Swayne kept of 
 a climb of the North Face of Mt. Terror. Mike wrote: "Chuck [Charlie 
 Bell] made no bones about the drugs he was on and popped pep pills several 
 times." Several paragraphs later I added this comment: "At the time I was personally 
 unaware of any drug use on Charlie's part...." Charlie Bell vehemently 
 denies he was using any drugs. I post his statement in full at 
 the end of this page.

 summit of Mt. Adams, 12,276 feet, in Washington State. In the
 background is Mt. Rainier, 14,411 feet in altitude. Probably 20
 to 30 people visited the summit that day, and I gave my camera to
 one of them to take the picture of the two of us. The flag and
 banners were there already and as you can see, it was very windy
 and on the cold side. I call this photo "Dos Amigos on Mt.
 Adams". We and another party came up from the north;
 everybody else came up from the south. It was 50 years earlier to
 the day that I climbed Pinnacle Peak, a satellite peak of Mt.
 Rainier which can be spotted with binoculars from this point. The
 following view from our stock photo library was the original
 photo appearing on this home page.

 Epson printer.

     These prints are 
 made from digital scans made at from 2400 dpi to 4800 dpi on a high end scanner. 
 The file sizes on prints made from 4x5 and larger transparencies/negatives range 
 up to 300 megabytes and more. More recent prints are made from original digital 
 images. The final prints are indistinguishable from traditional wet darkroom 
 prints, and the digital darkroom has provided controls over the image in ways 
 undreamed of in the traditional wet darkroom. Every print will be made and 
 signed by Ed personally, and will be shipped accompanied by a signed Certificate 
 of Authenticity.

      More on Charlie Bell: Mike Swayne kept a detailed daily journal on all 
 trips he took into the mountains. He wrote in them events that happened 
 during each day while the events were fresh in his mind. That journal is what 
 I was quoting from. I present here Charlie Bell's reply in full (now more than 
 46 years removed from the event):

      <br/>
      Drugs? Pep pills? 
 WHAT??
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This is absolute 
 nonsense. I don't know where Mike got that idea. This was 1961. I had never used 
 any drug and had no idea what a pep pill was. (I may have heard something about 
 benzedrine but I had never actually seen any.) I don't know what Mike saw me 
 eating -- it must have been some sort of candy, I suppose -- but I give you my 
 word (and it's about time somebody took it) that I had no "drugs" on that climb 
 or on any other.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Not, that is, until 1972 when 
 I was leading a group of young (age 14-15) companions on a traverse of the 
 Hermit Range in B.C. Before we left for Canada my brother, an M.D., had given me 
 a prescription for dexedrine to put in our first aid kit. We climbed
      <br/>
      Tupper, then bivouacked (I was always a slow climber), then went on to Mt. Rogers. As 
 we were descending I noticed the boys were stumbling (to be honest I was 
 stumbling a bit myself) so -- for the first and only time -- I broke out the 
 dexedrine and gave each member one tablet. The stumbling ceased and we all made 
 our way down to the Hermit Hut without incident (where one of the youngsters 
 said he experienced some mild and rather pleasant delusions before he went to 
 sleep). That is the only time in my climbing career that I ever ingested 
 anything that could be characterized as a "drug."
