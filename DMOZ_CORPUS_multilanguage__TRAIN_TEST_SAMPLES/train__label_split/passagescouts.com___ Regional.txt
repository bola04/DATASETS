          Cubs &amp; Scouts	Group Weekend in Dundrum 1st to 3rd Oct
         </div>
         <div class="news_body">
          We had 31 cubs and scouts in Dundrum for a rather wet but very enjoyable weekend. Being the first group 
    camp in quite some time we introduced the patrol camp competition. Patrols picked their own names and 
    worked through various tasks and fun events to win the coveted peg!  Team Toilet managed to fight off the 
    other teams (Team Actimil, Team Sean &amp; The Umpalumpas and Team The Humpty Dumptys) to win the prize with 
    each team member being awarded a unique woggle. Sadly the zip wire was out of action but a soccer 
    tournament soon lifted the spirits of the lads. It was a great weekend and one we intend to make an 
    annual event.

        Welcome to the Home page of 41st Cork, Passage West Scout Troop.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scouting is a world wide organisation that has a branch in just about every town &amp; village of Ireland and
 Passage West is no different. Ours is a small town about seven miles from Cork city located on the banks of 
 the River Lee. Passage West has been home to the 41st Scout Troop for over 40 years. In that time, like every 
 troop, there have been highs and lows. At present our numbers are on the increase with over 60 youth members 
 registered with us over three age sections.
       </p>
       <p>
        We currently meet in a local community hall for all program sections. Take a look at the different sections 
 for details or if you want contact us by e-mail at
