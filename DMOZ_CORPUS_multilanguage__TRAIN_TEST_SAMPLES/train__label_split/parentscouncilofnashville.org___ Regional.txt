            The Parents Council of Nashville (PCN)
           </span>
           has successfully facilitated community networking and the sharing of information concerning parenting issues of children grades 5-12 for twenty-six years.
           <br/>
           At the inception of PCN few parenting resources existed.  Time and technology has created opportunities to hear experts in specific issues affecting teens and gender specific issues. Our community is blessed with a rich heritage of parents interested in seeking knowledge to successfully meet the needs of their families. PCN recognizes how fast the pace of our culture has increased. Because everyone is busy it has been increasingly difficult to find leadership. We are now at the place where we cannot secure full board occupancy.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We have invested monies and considerable effort creating our website.  It is filled with twenty-six years of parenting information, much of which is timeless.  Our website has been accessed from all over the United States and as far away as South Africa.  Because of this activity the board voted to keep the website open through February.  We will then examine continuing interest and estimate the value of keeping it available until our resources are exhausted.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           We will still offer our parenting handbook "A Delicate Balance" for $5.00 a copy to support the website. We also still have a video library available and this resource is free for community use. You may contact Susan Henry at
           <a href="mailto:smghenry@aol.com">

           for details regarding the book and the video library.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The board of the Parents Council of Nashville deeply appreciates your years of support.  Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions.
           <br/>

           Julie Stephens - October 6 Speaker!
          </p>
          <p class="style13">
           Julie Stevens holds a BA in English from UCLA and a  Masters in Counseling Psychology from Lewis and Clark College, Portland,  OR. She spent twenty years as an educator in a variety of school  settings from high school to the college level. She has worked in a  preparatory independent school serving pre-school through 12th grade that included an upper  school boarding program; and in a suburban elementary school from families with  financial hardship. She taught high school English, humanities, and  religious studies.  She has worked as a family counselor.   She was a school psychologist. She was a CASA (Court Appointed  Special Advocate) for foster children.  She has had the opportunity to  work with a broad range of students and families.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Since  2004 she has served on the board of directors for the Center for Spiritual and  Ethical Education.  She has also been a member of CSEE’s Moral  Development Team, a panel of educators from independent schools across the  United States and Canada who have trained with some of the leading researchers  in the area of moral development, and who have led workshops and collaborated  on publications aimed at helping school communities develop effective character  education programs.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Since  2005 she has served on the board of directors for the Oasis  Center.  The psychological and educational welfare of young people is  her passion, and she believes that fostering homes, schools and communities  that promote moral growth is the most important work she can do.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Last  but not least, her views on parents, kids, and moral development have been  formed by the humbling experience of parenting (with her husband) three now  grown children.

           The Parents Council of Nashville (PCN) is a volunteer nonprofit organization whose purpose is to encourage, support and educate parents of Nashville’s youth.  We are currently comprised of
           <a href="who.htm#member_schools">
            twenty public, private, and secondary schools in the Nashville area

           How We Began
          </p>
          <p align="left" class="style13">
           We began in 1985 with approximately fifty parents and thirteen schools chaired by concerned Nashville parents Beth Campbell and Margaret Dye. We have grown considerably since then, and have benefited greatly from the contributions of
