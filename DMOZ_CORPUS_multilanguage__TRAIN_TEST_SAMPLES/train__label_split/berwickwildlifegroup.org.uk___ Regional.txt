       Whether you are a visitor to the Berwick area or are fortunate enough to live here, you will know that we have on our doorstep some of the most stunning landscapes in the UK, ranging from coast, cliff and dune, through river estuary to fertile rolling fields and the hills of the Cheviot massif, all within a distance of 20 miles from the town. Further topographical interest is added by evidence of an industrial past, with lime kilns, evidence of coal mining, and quarries all gradually returning to a natural state.

      <p>
       The geology and geography of the area have created conditions for interesting plant communities and marine and terrestrial habitats favourable for some of the UK痴 most iconic animals such as dolphins, otters and red squirrels (where Northumberland remains an English stronghold). There is a wealth of birds, both breeding and migratory, and of course the River Tweed is a world-famous salmon river.

       Berwick Wildlife Group (BWG) aims to celebrate and find out more about this diversity of local wildlife. We try to do this by raising awareness of what wildlife can be seen in the area and encouraging people to appreciate, enjoy and understand local wildlife. 
 We arrange various events such as summer walks and visits to nearby places of interest led by appropriate experts, winter talks by people involved with wildlife or conservation, and surveys of wildlife. throughout the year so that people can learn the process of wildlife recording and at the same time add to the database of local information.
      </p>

       Details of forthcoming events can be found on our
       <a href="Programme.html">
