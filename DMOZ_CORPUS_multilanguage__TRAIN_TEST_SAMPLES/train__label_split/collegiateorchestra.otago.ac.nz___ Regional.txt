     The Collegiate Orchestra is a community orchestra based at the
         University of Otago. The players are made up of students, staff
         and alumni from the University of Otago, College of Education,
         Otago Polytechnic, Otago Language Centre, Foundation Year, local
         schools as well as the greater Dunedin community. We provide an
         excellent training on orchestral techniques and expose players
         to a wide range of repertoire, from Baroque works to 20th
         Century Chinese symphonic works - the 2009 Semester Two
         programme included the violin concerto "Liang Shanbao and Zhu
         Yingtai" (小提琴協奏曲《梁山伯與祝英台》) (or known as "Butterfly Lovers"). See
     <a href="concerts.html">

     for our past programmes.
