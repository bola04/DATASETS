            <br/>
            His services are focused on helping individuals optimize their performance,

            <br/>
            <br/>
            Whether working with a large multinational corporation or a small 
               family owned business, the focus is on the individual and how to 
               help them achieve their goals. Allan combines his understanding 
               of the needs of today’s businesses with his extensive experience 
               in what it really takes to change behavior. He is skilled at getting 
               to the core of the problem and identifying strategies for change. 
               He works through the obstacles in order to change the behaviors 
               that have the greatest payoff for the individual and the organization.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Allan has worked with numerous business sectors including construction, 
               engineering, manufacturing, telecommunications, utilities, financial, 
               and food service. For the past 15 years, he has consulted with leaders 
               and executives throughout the Kansas City area as a result of his 
               work in the Saint Luke’s Executive Health Management Program. 
               In this program, he assists participants develop strategies for 
               managing stress levels at work and at home in order to enhance their 
               health and improve their effectiveness as leaders.
