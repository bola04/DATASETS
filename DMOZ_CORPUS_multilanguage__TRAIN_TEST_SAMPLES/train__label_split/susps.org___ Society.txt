       We support U.S. population stabilization purely for ecological reasons.  This requires we reduce both birth rates and migration to the U.S. to sustainable levels.  Unending population growth and increasing levels of consumption together are the root causes of the vast majority of our environmental problems, as is the case in many other countries.
      </p>
      <p class="AboutSUSPSHilite">
       As environmentalists, we in SUSPS are fully aware of the value of biodiversity.  An ecosystem is healthier when it has a wide variety of animal and plant species.  Similarly, we see value in ethnic and cultural diversity.  A nation with human diversity is better able to survive crises, and it benefits from the creativity that diversity inspires.
      </p>
      <p class="AboutSUSPSHilite">
       We are shocked and repulsed by the actions and statements of Neo-Nazis, xenophobes and racists of any kind.  We repudiate any support from people who have racial motives for reducing immigration. Racists and their offensive ideas and actions have no place in modern civilized society.

       is a network of Sierra Club activists who support a comprehensive approach to environmentalism within the Sierra Club.  This approach includes effective action for population stabilization in the United States.  Currently Sierra Club policies call for stabilizing U.S. population but do not address the combined impacts of mass migration and birth rates on U.S. population growth.
      </p>
      <p class="AboutSUSPS">
       Our vision for environmentalism, however, does not stop at our nation's borders.  It also includes educating women worldwide to achieve lower birth rates, lowering consumption levels in industrialized and developing nations, and protecting national parks and the world's remaining wild spaces from exploitation and development.
       <!-- We also support the fight to unseat all politicians hostile to preserving the environment. -->

      <h4>
       For the love of money
      </h4>
      <p>
       Since 1996, leaders of the Sierra Club have refused to admit that
 immigration driven, rapid U.S. population growth causes massive
 environmental problems.  And they have refused to acknowledge the need to
 reduce U.S. immigration levels in order to stabilize the U.S. population and
 protect our natural resources.  Their refusal to do what common sense says
 is best for the environment was a mystery for nearly a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, on
 Oct. 27, 2004, the Los Angeles Times revealed the answer:  David Gelbaum, a
 super rich donor, had demanded this position from the Sierra Club in return
 for huge donations! Kenneth Weiss, author of the LA Times article that
 broke the story, quoted what David Gelbaum said to Sierra Club Executive
 Director Carl Pope:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
       "I did tell Carl Pope in 1994 or 1995 that if they ever came out
 anti-immigration, they would never get a dollar from me."
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1996 and again in 1998, the Club's leaders proved their loyalty to
 Gelbaum's position on immigration, first by enacting a policy of neutrality
 on immigration and then by aggressively opposing a referendum to overturn
 that policy.  In 2000 and 2001, Gelbaum rewarded the Club with total
 donations to the Sierra Club Foundation exceeding
       <em>
        $100 million
       </em>
       .  In 2004 and
 2005, the Club's top leaders and management showed their gratitude for the
 donations by stifling dissent and vehemently opposing member efforts to
 enact an immigration reduction policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Gelbaum is entitled to restrict how his donations to the Sierra Club
 Foundation are spent. But he should NOT be permitted to influence how other
 members' dues or donations are spent or to dictate policy choices via the
 threat of withholding contributions.  That is completely inappropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even
 worse, Sierra Club leaders accepted Gelbaum's conditions in secret and
 forced a modification of the Club's policy to conform to his wishes.
 Furthermore, Club leaders certainly shouldn't have misrepresented
 immigration reductionists as anti-immigrant or racist in order to guarantee
 Gelbaum's donations; there is nothing inherently racist or anti-immigrant
 about sustainable levels of immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst of all, the U.S. population continues to grow by about 3 million
 people per year, of which nearly half are immigrants, and two-thirds of the
 growth is a result of immigration, if the children of immigrants are
 included.  Our forests continue to be clearcut to provide construction
 materials, our groundwater is depleted to provide water for our growing
 population, we grow more and more dependent on foreign sources of oil, and
 we are unable to reduce our output of greenhouse gases, all thanks to our
 burgeoning population.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't like it when the oil, timber, coal, and nuclear power industries
 oppose environmental reform, yet we understand why they do it:  for the love
 of money.  Is it any better when the Sierra Club opposes environmental
 reform for the love of money?

      <h4>
       Support U.S. Population Stabilization
      </h4>
      <br/>
      <h3>
       U.S. Population
      </h3>
      <p>
       SUSPS is concerned about population stabilization in the United states and that, as the Sierra Club recognizes:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
       "... all of our environmental successes may be short-lived if they do not include efforts to address population growth."
      </p>
      <p>
       SUSPS holds that this statement applies to domestic population growth as much as it does to worldwide population growth.  As a result of our country's immigration policies coupled with birth rates, the U.S. has the highest population growth of all developed countries.  In fact, according to the U.S. Census Bureau if we do nothing to change our nation's de-facto population policy, our population will double this century.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doubling will have a significant impact on the environmental legacy left to future generations of all species.  We will have to build practically an entire new infrastructure equal in size to our existing infrastructure in order to sustain this new population. The environmental consequences of this population growth will be significant.  SUSPS demands that the Sierra Club stop placing political sensitivities ahead of the environment and begin addressing migration levels and birthrates in the U.S.

      <br/>
      <h3>
       Birth rates
      </h3>
      <p>
       U.S. fertility, or birth rates, first dropped to less than replacement level fertility in 1972. Yet U.S. fertility is still dramatically higher than most all developed countries. For example, Europe's aggregate fertility varies between approximately 1.3 and 1.5, depending upon region.
 According to the Census Bureau's decennial census, U.S. population is growing by approximately 3.3 million per year. The growth due to natural increase is 1.6 million per year (total births minus deaths, including native-born births and births to immigrants).

       and U.S. population growth.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h3>
       Mass immigration
      </h3>
      <p>
       Immigration into the U.S. averaged a near replacement level of 178,000 per year from 1925 through 1965.  In 1965 Congress increased legal immigration approximately 6-fold through the Immigration and Nationality Act. After subsequent legislation further increasing yearly legal immigration, the U.S. now takes in a million legal immigrants and an estimated 700,000 illegal immigrants each year. This high level of migration will be responsible for nearly 70% of U.S. population doubling during this century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Environmentalists need not apologize for acknowledging this demographic reality.  To the contrary, environmentalists who refuse to recognize the seismic shift of demographics in the U.S. betray their own cause.  Only by confronting birth rates and mass migration as the root causes of U.S. population growth will we be able to ensure sustainability for future generations - of all species.

      <h3>
       Why global solutions are inadequate
      </h3>
      <p>
       The Sierra Club categorizes overpopulation exclusively as a worldwide problem requiring only global solutions.  Stabilizing world population in 50 or 100 years will not solve population problems within the U.S. because the flow of migration will continue unabated. Thus we must address overpopulation now, not later in our own country as well as in other countries throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we support the Sierra Club's current global policies designed to stabilize world population, we urge the Sierra Club to return to the roots of the environmental movement that encompass U.S. overpopulation - to also preserve and protect our own environment for the benefit of future generations.
