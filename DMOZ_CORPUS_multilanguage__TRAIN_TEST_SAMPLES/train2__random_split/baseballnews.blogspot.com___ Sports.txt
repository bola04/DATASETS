        Red Sox are getting ready to try again but with a new manager this year.  Bobby Valentine is the new skipper for the 2012 Red Sox and has had a very competitive and serious approach to spring training so far.  This could be a new Red Sox team that is eager to win.  It will be nice to see a more serious and competitive team on the field this year... after all, it's the 100 year anniversary of Fenway Park.

        <p>
         There was doubt whether Derek Jeter would play his 2,403rd game for the Yankees on Monday -- not that the captain is particularly counting.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeter played down the significance of his latest franchise milestone as  he passed Mickey Mantle's games record with his 2,402nd outing for the  Bronx Bombers in the first game of Sunday's day-night doubleheader in  Baltimore.
        </p>
        <p>
         "I don't even think you're aware of anything like that," Jeter said,  according to MLB.com. "When you first come up, you're just trying to  keep your job and stay here as long as you can."
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with the excitement at his 3,000th hit, Jeter suggested the appearance record was not something of great significance.
        </p>
        <p>
         "I don't think people get called up and look at, 'Let me see who has  the games-played record for the organization.' So this one was something  I never looked at. No one ever talked about it," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
         While reluctant to pop open the champagne, the achievement at least allowed the shortstop to reflect on his longevity.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         "I take pride in coming and doing my job. I think that's probably the  best way to put it," Jeter said. "My job is obviously to come and play  games, try to stay on the field and try to stay healthy. I've done it  for a long time, I guess."
        </p>
        <p>
         Ironically, a bruised right knee may keep him from the Yankees lineup  Monday after he missed Sunday's 8-3 night victory over the Orioles,  having sustained the injury in the earlier game.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeter was a late scratch, while Alex Rodriguez also was sidelined with a sprained left thumb.
        </p>
        <p>
         "We need to get them healthy," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said,  according to MLB.com. "It is somewhat of a concern, but hopefully  neither one of them will be out very long. I don't know if we'll have  either one of them (Monday)."
        </p>

        And that’s just what Baltimore Orioles infielder Robert Andino did last  night at Target Field, shagging Justin Morneau’s high floater into foul  territory and snagging it with his glove-less right hand during  Baltimore’s 6-1 trump  over the hapless Twinkies. A spectacular play, to be sure, but what I  like most about it is Andino’s style, his flair for the dramatic, all  the while flying in the face of convention and all that jazz. Good for  you, Robert Andino. You are a true individual.

        Josh Reddick hit the victory RBI single in the tenth inning and the Boston Red Sox beat the Yankees 3-2 to regain the lead in their division.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With their second straight win, the Red Sox return to sole lead in the Eastern Division of the American League with a game lead over the Yankees, who lost for the second consecutive game.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The victory also allowed the Red Sox win the series this season against the Yankees for the first time since 2004.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Reddick was charged with ending the game with a single to left field, pinch-runner Darnell McDonald making the difference.

         The Red Sox are looking for another pitcher for the rotation to ensure that there is constantly a quality pitcher on the mound for every game.  Injuries have caught up with the Red Sox who have managed to win games through a rotation period which has seen many different pitchers.  The Red Sox have been relying on offense to win games, but they know that they need pitching and defense as well as offense to win games.

         The Cincinnati Reds are also said to have strong interest in Ubaldo Jimenez who is having an "okay" year in Colorado.   Jimenez is 5-8 including 2 complete games and 1 shutout with a 4.08 ERA.  In 2010, Jimenez was an all-star, finished 3rd in the NL Cy Young voting and also finished in the top 25 for NL MVP voting after finishing 19-8 with a 2.88 ERA on the 2010 season.

        Dustin Pedroia was the hero last night as he managed to be "The Muddy Chicken " that won the game last night.
        <br/>
        It was a long and scoreless game last night but very beautiful as the pitchers did they best they could to get players out. After 5 hours and 44 minutes, Dustin Pedroia managed to hit a RBI single into the right that led Reddick to score.

        On September 30th, 1989, Jose Cano pitched his last game in a big league ballpark. The 27-year old from the small city of San Pedro de Marcoris in the Domincan Republic had spent his entire life trying to reach the Major Leagues, and now he had finally achieved his goal.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Throughout his six appearances that fateful season, Cano gathered a lifetime of memories that he would eventually bestow upon his young son, Robinson. Now, 22 years later, Robinson was offered a chance to repay his father on the grandest stage with one final memory that would top them all.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As the All-Star Yankee second basemen rallied past Boston's Adrian Gonzalez with a record-setting final round to claim the 2011 Home Run Derby title, there Jose was, pitching in a big league ballpark like it was 1989. As Robinson's final titanic blast sailed over the right-center field stands, the two met in the middle of the infield, embracing in a bear hug that meant more than anyone on that field could understand.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "The best thing is not my swing, it's the gentleman that was throwing B.P., my dad," Robinson said, as Jose stood by his side reveling in the post-event glory. "I want to tell him he's one of the best fathers, thank him for the support and making me who I am today."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sports are inherently about incredible stories. That's what keeps us watching year after year, disappointment after disappointment. Who would have thought that here, at an exhibition event that doesn't really mean much in the grand scheme of things, we would have the pleasure of witnessing such a perfect example of the power that sports can provide.

         was assured that the title of 2011 Homerun Derby Champion was all his.  Little could he have expected, the freight train that was

          Robinson Cano
         </a>
         would put on a historic performance that would instantly demote the incredible day of work the Boston All-Star had.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leading into the Homerun Derby, Vegas pegged Gonzalez as an 11/2  underdog despite the fact that the former San Diego Padre knew the  ins-and-outs of Chase Field like the back of his hand, having played  within its confines a countless number of times. That knowledge paid off  immediately, as Gonzalez crushed nine and eleven homeruns in the first  two rounds. By the time eliminations rolled by, the
         <a href="http://www.ticketwebsitehq.com/boston-red-sox-mlb-tickets/index.php">
          Red Sox
         </a>
         first basemen sat tied at the top of the leaderboard with an incredible  20 homeruns, most of them towering, highlight-reel shots that stunned  the Arizona crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
         That momentum continued once the final round commenced, as Gonzalez  rolled to a record tying 11 dingers. Throughout the performance his  blasts scattered across the park in spectacular fashion. Left field,  center field, right field; it didn't matter, he touched them all. In the  end, no one could have anticipated the force of nature that Cano would  become, but that shouldn't marginalize the amazing show the newest Red  Sox All-Star put on.

        media guide with a few teammates. As they scrolled through the records  section they noticed something startling: Never in the great, glorious  history of the franchise had there been a player who had 3,000 hits as a  Yankee.
        <p>
         Not Babe Ruth. Not Lou Gehrig. Not Joe DiMaggio.

         And right there Jeter had to understand the legacy he could own on a  franchise loaded with legends, several of whom were considered better  players than he. The Yankees might have a garden of monuments dedicated  to home run champions and triple crown winners, but none had 3,000  Yankee hits. That distinction alone would belong to Jeter as long as he  stayed healthy.

        The Red Sox have just designated OF Mike Cameron for assignment. Recalled INF Yamaico Navarro from Pawtucket (IL).

         The Red Sox and Yankees are battling for the AL East lead.  Boston has 1 more game against Philadelphia before a trip to Houston to take on the Astros.  Then a 3 game series at Fenway Park against the Blue Jays and a 4 game home series against Baltimore before the All Star Break.  Hopefully the Sox will walk away with at least 6 out of 8 games remaining.

        It's getting old.... fast. They could have 3 series (9 games) and be done with it.  It seems like it's getting too long and it is affecting pitchers and designated hitters the most.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Anyone else feel the same way?
