       From its origins as a small fishing village Saundersfoot is  now one of the premier resorts within Pembrokeshire, with its renowned blue  flag beach and traditional harbour. The harbour was built in 1829 when the  village was a thriving coal port and narrow gauge railways brought anthracite  down from local collieries.  Today there  is little evidence of this industrial past and the harbour is now a haven for  pleasure craft, and a variety of coastal voyages and fishing trips are  available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Waters Edge is located in the centre of the villages main  Blue flag beach, to the east lies the pretty cove of Coppet Hall from where you  can walk through the old railway tunnels or along the cliff top path to Wisemans Bridge.   While beyond the Harbour to the south are several small rocky coves  including Glen and Swallow   Tree Beaches  which are set along the wooded headland stretching out towards Monkestone Point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The historic coastal town of Tenby with its maze of narrow streets is just  three miles away on the other side of Monkestone Point.  Tenby with its superb natural harbour and  impressive architecture provides one of the most scenic backdrops, and boat  trips can be taken from here to nearby Caldey Island  with its Franciscan monastery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The magic of Pembrokeshire, the only wholly coastal National  Park in Britain  has to be experience first hand to appreciates its spectacular scenery,  wonderful wildlife and extensive heritage which make it such a joy to explore.
