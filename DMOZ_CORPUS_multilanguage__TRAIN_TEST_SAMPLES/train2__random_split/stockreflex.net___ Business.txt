 the wrong times. StockReflex takes the emotion out of the equation!

        How do you practice trading in an emotionless environment?
       </span>
       <br/>
       <p>
        The answer is simulation. Simulation allows you to pretend to trade real stocks using virtual money.
 Since your virtual money isnt real, you can concentrate on gaining deep understanding of the technicals of a stock without the bias brought by fear, greed and even pride.

        Every professional needs to practice to be at the top of their profession and trading is no different. Trading without practicing beforehand is as dangerous as walking out onto the Superbowl field for your first football game.

        According to a recent study at the University of California,
 90% of inexperienced stock market traders lose money.
       </span>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <span style="font-size:13px; font-weight: bold; text-align:left;">
        SO HOW DO YOU GET TO BE IN THE TOP 10% WHO ACTUALLY PROFIT?
       </span>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The answer is a combination of technical smarts, fundamental analysis and
       <strong>
        PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE
       </strong>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       So practicing your trading is importantbut you have to practice correctly for it to be of any value.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       If you are trading with real money in the market you are not practicing!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Whenever you have real money at stake your learning curve is going to be corrupted by your emotional response. How do your emotions prevent you from learning? They make you focus on the wrong things at the wrong times:
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <span style="color:#25540e;font-weight: bold;">
        Fear
       </span>
        Fear is the enemy of rational judgement. Fear makes you follow momentum instead of anticipate it. Fear keeps you from buying when a stocks downward move stalls and fear makes you sell too soon before youve had a chance to make a big profit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <span style="color:#25540e;font-weight: bold;">
        Greed
       </span>
       - Greed keeps you in the game too long. Greed makes you ride that spike up and then stay in as it comes all the way back down. When your emotions are influenced by greed you are seeing the future, not the present.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <span style="color:#25540e;font-weight: bold;">
        Pride
       </span>
       - Its hard to take a loss, even when it is the right thing to do. Too many investors hold on to a loser long past the time that they should have sold. Coupled with pride is overconfidence. Whoa betide a novice trader who gets lucky with their first few trades-those are the guys that leverage themselves up and then wipe themselves out!
