       About The Schaeffer Law Office, P.C.
      </p>
      <p>
       Formerly known as Schaeffer &amp; Lamere, the Schaeffer Law Office, 
 			P.C., is located in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area near Alton, 
 			Illinois, and is owned and operated by Evan Schaeffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 1990, Mr. Schaeffer has worked primarily as a civil 
 			litigator. He has represented both defendants and plaintiffs in a 
 			wide variety of actions throughout the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early in his career, Mr. Schaeffer worked at a large law firm 
 			where he defended corporations in the areas of admiralty, railroad, 
 			medical malpractice, and general commercial litigation. He also 
 			practiced white-collar criminal law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since leaving the defense practice in 1996, Mr. Schaeffer has exclusively 
 			represented consumers in matters both large and small. As one of the 
 			first class-action lawyers in the St. Louis area, Mr. Schaeffer 
 			aided ordinary people in a wide variety of actions, including
       <span class="auto-style5">
        Jarmon v. National Travel Services, Melvin 
 			v. Ameritech,
       </span>
       <span class="auto-style6">
        and
       </span>
       <span class="auto-style5">
        Farmer v. Jackson National
       </span>
       . Working both alone and with 
 			co-counsel throughout the country, Mr. Schaeffer was also involved 
 			in numerous other high-profile class action and mass-tort cases, 
 			including cases against Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and Merck. Mr. 
 			Schaeffer has also litigated many personal-injury cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this website, you will find further biographical information 
 			about Mr. Schaeffer. Though Mr. Schaeffer is always happy to take 
 			calls about legal matters (and will personally answer his phone), he 
 			now works mostly on cases referred by other lawyers. He also spends 
 			time helping other lawyers learn about litigation, primarily through 
 			his books and written work at
