        When thumbing through the major statistical categories 
 			of USAC AMSOIL National Sprint Car racing history, Dave Darland is 
 			the name that'll most likely appear at the top of every list you lay 
 			your eyes on. He's the only driver to reach 60+ wins, the only 
 			driver to start at least 700+ feature events and the only driver to 
 			win a USAC-sanctioned feature in 26 consecutive seasons.

        The “Kunkletown Kid” Ryan Smith earned his first 
 			Arctic Cat All Star Circuit of Champions presented by Mobil 1 
 			victory of the 2018 season in a thriller on Thursday night at Angell 
 			Park Speedway, inheriting command with just two circuits remaining 
 			after race leader, Carson Macedo, retired with mechanical woes. In 
 			actuality, Smith, the part-time pilot of the McGhee Motorsports/Mike 
 			McGhee and Associates/No. 11 sprint car, inherited the lead twice 
 			during the All Star/IRA Outlaw Sprint Series event in Sun Prairie, 
 			Wis., but the second proved to be worth $5,000.

         A weather front stuck in New Jersey for

         In March, Craig Dollansky was forced to

 			driver. A fractured vertebrae has plagued the driver since 2016. The 
 			journey has been long and arduous for Dollansky and his family. In 
 			December 2017, Doctors preformed a vertebroplasty procedure on 
 			Dollansky’s spine attempting to repair his L4 vertebra that was 
 			fractured down the middle. (classified as a burst fracture) Initial 
 			results from the vertebroplasty procedure appeared positive, and at 
 			Dollansky’s request, the attending physician wrote a letter stating 
 			that he could return to racing. As time passed however, and physical 
 			therapy began, it became more apparent that the vertebroplasty 
 			procedure results had failed. The cement material used in repairing 
 			the damaged vertebrae had leaked into the discs above and below 
 			causing additional damage and making major surgery the only option.

 			Track (PDTR). Starting off the night Justin was 4th in his heat race 
 			and Adam was 2nd in his. Both brothers secured A-main starting spots 
 			&amp; Adam’s luck may be changing as he caught the invert which helped 
 			place him into a 6th place starting spot; Justin would start 11th. 
 			The night moved along quickly and soon the brothers would be taking 
 			the green flag in the nights A-main! Adam quickly found his rhythm 
 			on the high-side and charged forward. His charge was successful as 
 			he captured his first top five A-main finish of the season, 
 			finishing 5th! Justin would make a late race charge from 11th and as 
 			the checkers waved, he would finish 6th right behind his brother! 
 			Both MFM drivers had solid nights and are eagerly awaiting this
