            did amazing well on the trip down to Albuquerque.  He slept most of the way and had no "accidents" in the car.  In fact, he has gone two weeks with no accidents in his kennel at night.  We've never had a dog do that before! Jake has been to the Vet twice.  Once for a well puppy check and the second for shots.  Vet says he is a well adjusted, happy pup.  Training is going fairly well. Jake already knows "sit" and is working on "come" and "stay".  Housebreaking is coming along well as well.  He is now starting for the front door when he needs to go out.  We are now two days accident free.  Never had a pup learn so quickly.  Thanks again for all your help and we will be sure to recommend you to our friends.

             I am not sure if Carol has had time / chance to give you an update on the pup we picked up a week ago today. She is settling in quite well and is very inquisitive and really watches Fenway and her every move. She is growing like a weed and loves everyone she meets when out in the front of the house watching people walking by. She is learning commands such as sit, drop, down, etc. So far all is going as good as or even better than we thought possible. Thanks for everything you did in getting this pup ready to go out into the world.

             We bought Brooks from you guys back in 2012 from the Feb. litter from Brutis and Willow. He’s certainly come a long way in his training, so I took him to Canada for a week to waterfowl hunt. The following is a picture of his first duck. I know you guys put a lot of these pictures on your board there in the office. Thanks again.

             Hi, Farfel is 6 months and over 50lbs! He is really great and we could not be happier. He is an energetic loving dog. He is a fetching machine. He is extremely smart. He was trying to pick up his ball and Frisbee at the same time, he stopped looked at it a moment, flipped the Frisbee over, placed the ball in it and carried them both to me 🙂 Thanks.

             We have been wanting to write you to let you know how pleased we are with Gabe. He is a wonderful puppy! At 11 weeks he is crate trained, walks on a leash, already knows his name and several commands (stay and down are hard but he learns fast!). We have been pleasantly surprised at how well he made the transition into our home. He is great around other dogs and wonderful with people, especially children. He loves to cuddle and is sitting in my lap while I write this message. We think that the early care you provided is to thank for his wonderful personality. He has reminded us to have fun every day. So thank you!

             Joyce and I want to thank you for a great puppy we got from you in June. Jenny is 13 weeks old now and a joy to be around. She is showing great progress in obedience training and I have just started her retrieving. She loves the water and really wants to get after the geese on our pond. I spend a lot of time with her and it is showing. She is really growing fast. When we got her she weighed 16# and now is at 28#. Very enthusiastic and it looks like she will be an exceptional dog. I have trained a lot of bird dogs and she shows more intelligence and drive than any I have had before. Thanks again,

             I was just browsing through to make sure you guys were still breeding wonderful dogs!  I have a yellow lab from you – he’s out of Lucky. I purchased him back in August of 2010.  I just wanted to let you guys know that I absolutely adore this dog and couldn’t imagine my life without him.  He is my best friend, my confidant, my snuggle buddy, my running partner, my right hand, and everything to me.  I feel so grateful for him every single day.  I am so happy to see you guys are still breeding because I don’t think there’s a better lab out there!  One of these days I’ll get in touch with you for a rambunctious male black field lab.  I have plans to name him “Angus.”  Thank you for breeding such perfect pups!

             Just wanted to thank you again and give you an update on Ava. She is almost 6 months old and we have been having a great waterfowl season up in my neck of the woods. She is progressing in her skills every day and is fully marking and retrieving 10lb geese out of her mud hut. It is great to see all of our time and effort in training come full circle. This dog has no fear and takes on wounded fowl every chance she gets. It amazes me how much natural instinct she has from your bloodlines. I will never buy a lab from any other breeder, you have a world class operation down there. Thanks again.

              (a Bob and Pearl pup)
             </em>
             . We named her Eichhorns Jet Black Willow. She is wonderful. She is a little spit fire and keeps up with all the adult dogs. Bo is teaching her the ropes and all the tricks! She loves to swim. She's mastering lots of tricks with no problem! Potty training was a breeze. She is beautiful and we can't thank you enough for the great dogs you raise. Thank you. 08/17/2015 update: I wanted to give you an update on our devilishly beautiful little girl. She is a "regular" at Kiowa Creek Sporting and Hunting Club.  She is just learning the bird dog life....and she is GOOD. We still have some small things to work on, but we couldn't be happier. Thanks for all wonderful breeding and babies!

At 11-months she is quartering like a pro, she heels on command, and last weekend she executed several blind retrieves flawlessly. She’s quickly picking-up casting and marking multiple birds at the same time. The most important qualities that must be inherited – her temperament, nose, and drive – are just outstanding. I couldn’t be happier, thank you.

             Hi guys, I just wanted to send you a quick note about one of Magnum Force’s and Liken Lucy’s pups whelped on Sept 14th 2013. He was one of the last ones left out of the litter. I named him Timber and I knew he had something special when I first held him and got him home. Right now we are pursuing our Master National Title in October of this year. If he makes it to SC this year he will only be 25 months old. He definitely has what it takes, the drive, the focus, the intensity and the trainability. I have never had a hunting buddy that was more excited to go duck hunting than I was so I feel he is giving me a run for my money. Just wanted to let you know how one of your pups is doing. If it doesn’t happen this year (it will only be because of my schedule and not being able to get him the MH qualifiers) then 2016 is a lock! I think I actually have more fun watching him work than actually shooting the birds.
             <strong>
              10/07/2015 update:
             </strong>
             Timber earned his MH title at 2 years of age.  He only needs 2 more passes to qualify for next year's Master National.

             Dear Jim and Debbie,  We got a yellow male from Remi and Magnum's litter born on March 27th! We named him Griffey and he is the perfect puppy! He loves people and always wants to please, he loves to fetch, go on walks, and swim in his pool. He is very smart and learning new things all the time. We are so thankful we got him from you! He is just a few days over four months and about 35 pounds. The vet said he is healthy and is going to be a big dog. I have attached some pictures of him for you to see. Thank you again! We adore Griffey!

             is adjusting well in her new home.  We are working on basic puppy obedience skills where she continues to impress and amaze. She's smart, quick to pick up new commands, has a mild and loving temperament and she's more than willing to please.  She's taken well to her crate both inside and a nice new canvas crate for the car.  She's completely potty trained too! She loves car rides and waits quietly while I grocery shop etc. Thanks so much for another great Labrador Retriever!

             </em>
             first birthday. We have had labs for 35 years and she is fast becoming one of our smartest. She learned how to open doors several months ago. She can even open the front door and let herself out. She may have been an incredible service dog. She is an excellent traveler and has visited 15 states, and just returned from a six week Florida vacation at the beach. This week she will start training with chuckers. We love her to pieces. She was last pick.  I can't imagine how she could be any less than her littermates.

             turned 1 year old I wanted to touch base and let you know he is doing very well. He weighs about 83 lbs. and is in good health.  I have been training him to be a Hearing Assistance/Service Dog since he was 8 weeks old and he is doing well at that also.  Duke loves the ranch up here in Silverthorne and gets along so great with our other dog and those he meets.

             has brought into our lives since we picked her up from you on January 2nd of this year. She is an absolute sweetheart, so calm, gentle, peaceful and comforting.  She is attentive and eager to please so she learns extremely quickly.  She is incredibly patient, trusting and understanding.  She hardly ever barks -- only to alert us that someone is at the door or approaching the house.  She loves to be in the same room with us, play tug of war, swim, going with us on hikes, long walks and runs.  What a wonderful companion she is.  We cannot imagine life without her.

What absolutely astounded me is her apparently natural love of mountain biking and trails. Never in my life have I felt such a close connection with a dog, and I have had some truly amazing dogs. We are already having so much fun together and she's only 4 months old. She is the sweetest thing ever.  Thank you again!

             I just wanted to shoot you a quick thank you e-mail.  I got a black male from Sunny and Magnum's litter that was born on 12/20/2015.  It's been almost a year since I picked him up.  I named him Remi and he has been an absolutely impressive dog in his first year.  I started training with him almost immediately and his drive and intelligence has been as good as it gets.  By the time he was 8 months old he was fully ready to hunt both waterfowl and upland birds.  We have been able to get a lot of bird hunting in this first year; started him out with grouse in September, and have also hunted almost every weekend that duck season has been open. We even got to spend a week in December hunting quail down in Arizona.  Even more impressive than his hunting ability and drive has been his temperament.  He has been exposed to the whole spectrum from new born babies, to kids, to elderly and has handled himself great.  He is an absolute joy to have around.  Anyways, just wanted to thank you for what you are doing and I hope you continue it for the foreseeable future.

He is very smart, adorable and very loving.  We have gone through two training classes with him and he is doing extremely well with it.  We just love this little (more like big 55 lbs.) guy.  Thank you so much for this wonderful addition to our home.

             Hi there Debbie and Jim! First of all we wanted to thank you for taking such good care of our Maggie Mae during our last outing. Your kennels are so very nice and it's such a peaceful beautiful area.  However, most importantly, we wanted to say thank you for our Maggie; she is truly a wonderful loving dog.  She is from the Magnum/Nickie litter born 11/03/2015.  We bonded with her immediately, and she with us! She slept through the first night we brought her home and has ever since.  She is such a positive addition to our family (the two of us) and she especially loves our grandchildren!  Thanks again!

             </em>
             My birthday is August 11, 2017.  I am very sweet and playful.  I am excited to announce that I am on my way to becoming a service dog for one of our American heroes! There are over 50 basic and advanced behaviors I need to learn while I'm in the Patriot PAWS Service Dogs program.  I will be starting with the basics such as sit, down and walking on leash.  I am so excited to begin my journey and I will keep you updated along the way.  Thanks for your support.  Without you I wouldn't have such a meaningful job! I mean, I could've just been a "pet dog".  No offense to them but I've heard about those pets and some of them can be crazy! I guess not all dogs can be super heroes like myself and friends at Patriot PAWS.

             <em>
              (a Magnum &amp; Sunny pup)
             </em>
             is 1.5 years old and I couldn't be happier with my breeder selection. Basic obedience was a breeze and he's been so receptive to training I've literally run out of things to teach him. From closing doors, playing dead, sitting on shore patiently while I fly fish, to taking casting signals in the field, this dog's intelligence really impresses everyone he meets. He is great with other animals, has never showed any signs of aggression, and is even great with little kids! Hands down he is the family dog/sportsman dog I had always dreamed of having.  I will be back in a few years to get him a younger brother!  Thank you!

              (a Bob &amp; Ruger pup)
             </em>
             is amazing.   He is extremely healthy, smart, agile, friendly, well behaved, etc. He is a star in our home, and our elder lab has aged in the reverse thanks to his influence and playfulness.  Lucas is the best pup - every time people meet him they can't believe how calm he is and how well he listens. Labs are quick learners, but this little guy is months ahead of other Labrador pups we've adopted and raised.

             from you two years ago, they both turned out to be fantastic.  I'm very pleased. I have recommended other people to your kennel.  You may remember me and Deb, I had a great visit with the two of you. Enclosed are pictures of your dogs at 2 years old.  The one with the green collar is Blackjack and the orange collar is Harley.  They are a great addition to our family. Blackjack is a lover and a watch dog. Harley is a lover and watchdog when Blackjack needs his help.  Thank you.

             is one of the smartest dogs I've ever owned. She is extremely healthy at 1 years old and has no medical problems.  She is full of energy and loves to retrieve.  Sadie trained for bird hunting and it was so natural to her that it required very little training.  She is obedient and calm when needed. Jim and Debbie have an excellent kennel and couldn't be more happy to get a second dog from them!  Thanks.

             She is a fantastic puppy and one of the smartest we have raised over the last 40 years.  We have a couple of bird hunting friends that would steal her in a New York minute!  Just being around her they can tell she was bred to hunt birds.  She already stands as still as a statue and points when the birds or rabbits are out.  We take her to work every day so she gets a lot of interaction and training.  Thanks again and have a great evening!
