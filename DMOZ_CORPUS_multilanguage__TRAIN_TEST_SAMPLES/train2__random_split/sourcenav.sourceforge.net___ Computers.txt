   source navigator NG is a source code analysis tool.
   <br/>
   with it, you can edit your source code, display relationships between classes and functions
 and members, and display call trees.
   <p>
    you can navigate your source code and easily get to declarations or 
 implementations of functions, variables and macros (commonly called "symbols") which helps you discovering 
 and mapping unknown source code for enhancement or maintenance tasks.

   the nineth stable version NG4.5 has been released.
   <br/>
   we usually release binary versions for linux (32bit) and windows (win32_ 32bit) _ but SN is known to build on solaris_ OS X_ HP-UX and others.
   <p>
    SN 6.0 was an one-time only old Source Navigator release and is equal to NG3; it's only for reference and does not mark the latest version.
   </p>
   <p>
    currently the java browser is broken for 1_5 and 1_6 code_ and OS X suffers from a bad malloc().
