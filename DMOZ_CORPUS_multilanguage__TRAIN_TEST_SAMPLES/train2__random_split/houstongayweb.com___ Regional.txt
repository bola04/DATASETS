             There is a new Country Dance Hall in town called the Neon Boots Dancehall and Saloon to be exact. It is set to open at 11410 Hempstead Highway, the space that once was the   Esquire Ballroom. The historic 1955 building on the outskirts of the   city which has played host to Patsy Cline, George Jones and Willie   Nelson. The building has undergone a major renovation after laying fallow since the   Esquire shut its doors in 1995. Neon Boots will be open Thursdays   through Sundays, and plans include cowboy karaoke and line dancing   lessons.

              U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison Website Displays Gay Terms in Hidden Text
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             It looks like Google and Yahoo have banned the website of the Texas Governor wannabe Kay Bailey Hutchinson.  Her website which is forkay.com was found to have hidden text that said things such as "Perry Gay".  This could have been for the traffic since they stuffed many words to make searches for Governor Perry turn up with the word gay in certain terms.  They seem to blame it on a technical issue but who knows whom to believe.  She is just another Sarah Palin if you ask me.  It is an insult to gays as one blogger noted.  We should make sure that we support a democrat or independent that has a chance of winning this governor race in Texas or we will have Faith-based Kay or Faith-based Rick running things.
