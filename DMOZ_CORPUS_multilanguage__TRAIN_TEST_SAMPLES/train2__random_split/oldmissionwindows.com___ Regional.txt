           Sunrise Windows
          </p>
          <p>
           Sunrise  Windows was formed in 1994 by Gary Delman, Larry VanDeVelde, and  Elliott Delman. For many prior years, these three worked at another  nationally known manufacturer of vinyl windows which was founded by  Gary's father. After that company was sold to a publicly traded  company, Gary, Elliott and Larry continued to work there, but over the  ensuing seven years, the direction of the company changed dramatically  from the initial focus. An entrepreneurial, innovative company started  to evolve into a typical corporate environment. The needs of the  customers and the creativity of the employees were no longer paramount,  and so, Gary, Elliott and Larry decided there had to be a better way.  By continuing to listen to the wants and desires of customers and  employees, Gary, Elliott and Larry set off to design a brand new  company, that being Sunrise Windows.

            VELUX  has a long history of fulfilling consumer desires for natural light and  ventilation, going all the way back to our founding in Denmark back in  1941.

            The company beginnings were out of necessity. After  the devastation of WWII, there was a tremendous lack of housing and  commercial space throughout Europe. The VELUX founder, Mr. Villum Kann  Rasmussen, saw an opportunity to provide more space by bringing natural  light and air into attic spaces through the roof. This idea led to the  design of the first roof windows, which were initially used to convert  unused attics into classrooms.

            From those early beginnings, VELUX has expanded  throughout the world by providing ways to convert unusable space into  the best room in the house.

            VELUX first came to the US in 1975, with the  creation of the first VELUX overseas sales and marketing company, VELUX  America Inc. This was followed in 1978 by the establishment of VELUX  Greenwood Inc, the manufacturing center of VELUX products sold in the  US, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countries. In 2001, VELUX  Solutions Inc was created to oversee the proper installation and  servicing of VELUX products in the US.

           Old Mission Windows Expands, Enhances Services With Four Seasons Acquisition.
          </p>
          <p>
           TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. - Old Mission Windows has acquired another  locally owned and operated window company, Four Seasons Windows and  Glass. The acquisition is expected to increase the company’s sales by  about $1 million, along with expanding its product line and services.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           “We’re  very excited about the expansion of our operations and how it will  benefit our customers, our company and our employees,” said Old Mission  Windows president Jim Cesario.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           The acquisition  allows Old Mission Windows to provide its customers with a more  complete line of premium custom windows and doors by adding the Weather  Shield™ brand. For the last 30 years, Four  Seasons Windows and Glass, a family-owned, full service window and  glass company has been the sole distributor of Weather Shield™ products. As a result of the acquisition, Old Mission Windows will take the lead as the primary distributor of Weather Shield™ products in northern Michigan, whose products include aluminum clad wood and vinyl windows and doors.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           “By  adding this product line, and bringing Dave Schichtel, the previous  owner of Four Seasons Window and Glass on staff, we are consolidating  the premier window and door choices available to northern Michigan  customers under the roof of one well-established, local business,” said  Cesario. “We anticipate that this venture will have a positive impact  on the local economy as we increase services and employment  opportunities in the community.”
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           As part of the expansion, Old Mission Windows will increase its showroom space to display the new Weather Shield™ products. The expansion is scheduled to be complete by April 2007.

           Kolbe Windows and Doors showcased in Michigan Award-Winning Home
          </p>
          <p>
           Wausau,  Wis. (Aug. 2006) – The forested, rolling terrain and many lakes  surrounding Michigan's Traverse City area lure homeowners, designers,  builders and naturalists. Marcy Hurst and Scott Norris, co-owners of  Olde World Custom Homes, have focused their design/build business on  creating efficient, beautiful designs constructed for waterfront and  "view" sites such as Joni and Bob Formisano's new home. The couple's  visually striking, timber frame residence showcases 82 Kolbe-crafted  windows and doors offering near limitless views of Pearl Lake's eastern  shore.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           The amount of glass might suggest the  house would have energy efficiency issues in its northern climate, but  quite the opposite is true. Kolbe's Ultra Series windows and doors  helped earn the house a Michigan ENERGY STAR® grant. The grants are  awarded every year to licensed residential builders whose projects  demonstrate energy efficiency and innovative design and construction.  Grant recipients receive up to $8,000 for marketing, energy rating and  other expenses. The Formisano's home was the highest scoring of the  five winners for 2005.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           "Kolbe's products are so  diverse, that it was very easy to design windows to fit the home's  sense of place and style and enable it to merge more compatibly with  its surroundings," said Marc Cesario of Old Mission Windows, which  supplied the windows and doors. The house features several radius  units, and there are custom grills in all 12 doors and 60 windows. The  windows are trimmed in pine, and fir was used on the doors.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Olde  World specified Kolbe products both for aesthetics and their energy  efficiency track record. Dual-insulating glass units with LoE² coating  and argon gas are standard on Ultra Series products, helping them to  meet or exceed ENERGY STAR guidelines in all climate zones. Cesario  also noted, "The superior ratings of Kolbe's products means homeowners  can enjoy the views without thinking that their dollars are flying out  the windows – or the doors."
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           This two-story, $1.4  million home encompasses 6,200-square-feet and "shows that it's  entirely possible to have a large home and still be environmentally  conscious," said Hurst. "Because this house meets ENERGY STAR  requirements, the cost of heating/cooling it is 61% less than a  similarly-sized home that doesn't."
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Although Olde  World has not previously pursued ENERGY STAR grants, Hurst emphasized  "energy efficiency is always our first focus, because it is the longest  lasting value that we can provide to our clients. Our design and  building standards are such that all of the homes we have completed  would comply with the ENERGY STAR requirements."
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           The  Formisano's ENERGY STAR home also won the People's Choice Award for  Best Home in the Grand Traverse area's annual Parade of Homes. Hurst  said the Parade is one of Olde World's biggest marketing tools: "The  attendants of the Parade are looking for all kinds of new ideas. It was  great to be able to show them so many sustainable and energy efficient  resources in one place."
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Along with Kolbe's  energy-efficient Ultra windows and doors, the residence incorporates  sustainable and recycled materials, and sensible approaches to energy  management. For example, radiant heat elements for the first floor  allowed downsizing of the forced air furnace because once the desired  heating level is reached, the radiant heating makes that level easier  to maintain, so the furnace uses less fossil fuel. Structural insulated  panel construction (two layers of oriented strandboard with styrofoam  in between), cement fiber siding and a heat recovery ventilator --  which takes air from outside and conditions it before releasing it  inside -- are other conservation considerations.

           12/8/06 ~ Combating Condensation
          </p>
          <p>
           In  the fall and early spring you may notice small beads of moisture on the  glass. These small beads that appear on the windows and doors are a  natural occurrence that is a symptom of excess humidity in your home.  In almost all instances these small beads known as condensation are not  a result of a defect in your window or door. You will notice  condensation on your windows and doors first, because their surface  temperature is lower than other visible surfaces in your home (ex:  walls, attics…).
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           CAUSES OF CONDENSATION
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           The  level of condensation in your home is affected by a mixture of gases in  the air. Almost all air holds a gas commonly known as water vapor. This  vapor is referred to as humidity. Humidity is moisture in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Relative  humidity can be figures out by taking the amount of water vapor  actually in the air divided by the amount of water vapor the air can  hold. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air. If air is 100%  saturated when the temperature drops, the colder air will need to  release water vapor. The vapor that is released and seen on your  windows and doors is known as condensation.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Condensation  on your windows and door occurs, because the outside temperature drops,  and the glass on your windows and doors is cool enough to begin cooling  the air indoors. Because cooler air cannot hold as much water vapor as  warm air, the saturated air inside your home releases excess water  vapor once it reaches the cold glass on your window or door. The colder  the temperature is outside the lower your humidity level in the house  must be to reduce the potential for condensation.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT CONDENSATION?
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Use  your windows and doors as an early warning signal for potential  condensation problems, because they’re usually the coldest surface  inside your house and usually the first place where damage occurs.  Seeing condensation on windows and doors will notify you of a problem  with the humidity level in your house, before it becomes a more serious  problem. If left unchecked, a condensation problem in your home may  cause wood to rot, paint to peel, insulation to deteriorate, molds to  grow- the floors may even buckle. Even if the moisture problem is not  excessive, it can deteriorate the wood, as well as interior finish.  And, when water runs off a window or door, it can seep into,  deteriorate and discolor drywall and carpeting.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           IS CONDENSATION MORE PREVELENT TODAY?
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           In  most older homes, the insulation and weather-stripping, and other house  tightening factors allowed the house to breathe and exchange drier air  with more humid air. Most newer homes are built for energy efficiency.  They are sealed very well and have less ventilation than older homes.  Thus drier air is not allowed to exchange with the humid air in your  home, causing more humidity in your home.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           WHERE DOES WATER VAPOR COME FROM?
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           One shower produces ½ pint or water vapor.
           <br/>
           Cooking and dishwashing produces 1 pint or water vapor per meal.
           <br/>
           One household plant produces 1 pint of water vapor daily.
           <br/>
           One person’s breathing produces 3 pints of water vapor per day.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT CONDENSATION?
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Fortunately  there are many possible solutions to the problem of condensation. If  one solution doesn't eliminate the problem, try another- or a  combination.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Check your window coverings. Heavy  window coverings restrict the flow of warm air over the interior glass  surface. Therefore, the glass remains cool and allows condensation to  form.
            <br/>
           </li>
           <li>
            If you use a humidifier in your house  in the winter, keep an eye on the humidity level. When it gets too  high, turn the humidifier down or off completely.
           </li>
           <li>
            Reduce  indoor humidity by cracking open windows for short periods of time each  day. Outdoor winter air is much drier than indoor air. Open windows to  allow moist air to escape and dry air to enter- the humidity level will  lessen as a result.
           </li>
           <li>
            Use bathroom, kitchen and laundry room exhaust fans to vent humidity to the out doors.
           </li>
           <li>
            If  there is condensation between a storm window and sash, humidity is  being trapped. Simply loosen the storm window a bit to let moisture  escape. (This will affect your heating cost very little.)
           </li>
           <li>
            Vent all gas burners and clothes dryers to the outdoors, as water vapor is a by-product of gas combustion.
           </li>
           <li>
            Raise glass surface temperatures by installing appropriate heating systems under windows and near the floor on exterior walls.
           </li>
           <li>
            Install an air-to-air heat exchanger. This will exhaust stale air and  bring in fresh air, white transferring heat for the stale air to the  fresh air.
           </li>
           <li>
            Install a wide overhang and/or rain gutters and downspout to divert rain water away from the house foundation.
           </li>
           <li>
            Replace single-pane windows with insulating glass windows, install  storm windows or both. Single pane windows are often inadequate- the  glass becomes very cold in winter, allowing moisture, frost and ice to  form.
           </li>
           <li>
            Cover ducts and pipes with insulation that have a  vapor barrier on the outside; seal joints between sections of  insulation with barrier tape.
           </li>
           <li>
            Insulate walls to keep  their interior surfaces warm and prevent condensation. Check insulation  periodically. If it settles, insulation should be added so the upper  wall is protected.
           </li>
           <li>
            Vent crawl spaces. Sealed crawl spaces  force moisture to penetrate floors above and cause humidity problems as  well as floor damage. Foundation vents in the crawl space, together  with a ground cover such as polyethylene film, will prevent moisture  from penetrating the floor above.
           </li>
           <li>
            Insulating the  ceiling. This will reduce heat loss as will as prevent condensation  problems. Install the insulation at the exterior wall by extending it  over the wall plate, then fastening it down. Otherwise, wind can blow  under the insulation and chill the exterior part of the ceiling.
           </li>
           <li>
            Vent  the attic. Because condensation that forms in an attic can drip to the  ceilings below, attics need proper ventilation. Check that attic  louvers are not obstructed. Ventilation should be distributed uniformly  along the roof, equally divided between the high ridge and the low  overhang. Attics need two vent openings: one to take outdoor air in and  one to allow indoor air to escape. Call a heating or ventilation  contractor for help in attaining the right amount of ventilation in  your attic.
           </li>
           <li>
            Vent exterior walls by installing miniature  louvers known as cold-side venting. This will prevent moisture from  condensing between exterior and interior walls. It is especially  helpful if a home does not have an exterior vapor barrier, to ensure  that water vapor that enters the wall space has a means to escape to  the outdoors. One square inch of venting should be installed between  each stud.
           </li>
           <li>
            If building new or remodeling, consider  installing a vapor barrier to the exterior wall surface. The membrane  should be continuous and unbroken to prevent moisture seepage. All  joints must overlap and the barrier must be fastened securely on studs,  joists or bracing.
           </li>
           <li>
            Grade the ground around the house for good drainage. This will help prevent moisture from entering the house.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Should  mildew that is caused from condensation on your windows and doors  occur, you should remove it as soon as possible. Mildew can be removed  using a solution of 10-20% bleach and the remainder water. Scrub  affected areas with a soft cloth to loosen mildew, then rinse  thoroughly. Wear protective clothing, especially for eyes and hands.  Wash and rinse body well after each mildew removal session.
          </p>

           EXTERIOR CONDENSATION
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           Condensation  which is located on the exterior of your windows is nothing to worry  about. Exterior condensation means the windows and doors are doing  their job. The more energy-efficient your windows and doors are, the  more likely they are to experience exterior condensation. The only way  to reduce exterior condensation is to increase the temperature of the  outer glass surface above the dew point of the air. You can try  increasing the temperature inside your home or opening the blinds,  shades or drapes, but you may not be able to eliminate exterior  condensation completely.
          </p>

           MOISTURE BETWEEN THE PANES OF GLASS
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           If  moisture is present between the two panes of glass, there may be a  problem with the seal on the unit. Contact your window supplier for  information on having the unit checked for seal failure.
