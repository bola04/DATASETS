            The basic concept of
 														this site is to explore
 														the changes that have
 														taken place over the
 														last 50 years along a one-mile stretch
 														of Chicopee Street in
 														Willimansett,
 														Massachusetts. This
 														small business microcosm
 														connects my childhood
 														home and the elementary
 														school that I attended
 														from 1958 through 1967. At the
 														time, Chicopee Street
 														was the main route
 														connecting the city
 														centers of Chicopee and
 														Holyoke. The
 														walk to and from school
 														presented me with a wide
 														variety of businesses,
 														each of which fascinated
 														me, even at a very young
 														age, and had a story to
 														tell. During the
 														years between
 														kindergarten and 8th
 														grade, things were
 														rapidly changing, and
 														businesses that had
 														thrived for years were
 														already closing. Most
 														importantly, the changes
 														that took place in my
 														microcosm were taking
 														place - or were soon to
 														take place - throughout
 														America.

            <br/>
            Was the neighborhood
 														movie theater a victim
 														of television or the
 														mobility that made it
 														easy to drive across the
 														Connecticut River to the new
 														multi-screen cinemas in
 														West Springfield? Or did
 														the owner simply decide
 														to throw in the towel
 														after he realized that
 														there was no money to be
 														made with 25¢ Saturday
 														double-feature matinees
 														and the candy
 														concession? Consumption
 														patterns changed
 														dramatically in my
 														microcosm in the 1960’s,
 														and this was still years
 														before the development
 														of shopping malls, the
 														cancerous growth of
 														Wal-Mart, the dawn of
 														the Internet, the influx
 														of cheap goods from
 														China, or the
 														“maturation” of the baby
 														boom generation which
 														would bring new meaning
 														to the concept of
 														obsessive
 														overconsumption. As
 														neighborhood businesses
 														have fallen by the
 														wayside against the
 														backdrop of these new
 														market forces, it is
 														truly surprising that
 														any could survive. Not
 														simply a walk down
 														Memory Lane, let’s walk
 														my “mile” to see if
 														there are any lessons to
 														be learned.

            If you would like to
 														contribute any “missing
 														pieces” to my story,
 														particularly if you have
 														period photographs of
 														the neighborhood and any
 														of the businesses which
 														I have cited (both
 														“before” or “after”),
