                Downtown Charleston captures everything this picturesque waterfront  city has to offer: the downtown southern restaurants, charming hotels, cruise  ships, Victorian-style homes, arts and crafts homes, historic bungalows, nearby  beaches, markets, and shops; not to mention the Charleston Waterfront   Park and the Charleston South  Carolina Aquarium.
               </p>
               <p>
                Parking is  often a challenge in downtown Charleston,  but your best bet is to find a parking garage off King or Meeting Street and spend some time  walking around the bustling area. Staying in one of the many downtown Charleston hotels or bed and breakfasts is a romantic  experience to be had by all and they are located close to all of Charleston's restaurants  and attractions.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you walk  around long enough, you're sure to find some of your favorite cuisine. With Charleston’s location on  the water, there are seafood restaurants serving up the daily catch on nearly every  block. If seafood isn’t your fare, there are many Italian and American  restaurants to choose from in downtown Charleston.
               </p>
               <p>
                The  Charleston Market is downtown's hub on the weekends. Vendors set up tables  along the open-air market and sell a variety of clothes, apparel, and art. The  market's location is just a couple blocks from the ocean and Charleston Waterfront   Park.

                Charleston’s Harleston Village  neighborhood was named after John Harleston when it was developed and streets  were opened in 1770.   The Harlestons,  during the Colonial period, were active in the government of the Province and  also accomplished breeders of racehorses.   Streets in the Village of Harleston  were named for prominent men of the period, in England and the Province. The Royal  Governor, Lord Charles Greville Montagu, along with Lt. Gov. William Bull;  Hecter Beranger de Beaufain, Collector of Customs and member of His Majesty’s  Council; William Pitt, the British member of Parliament who defended Colonial  rights; as well as John Rutledge, Thomas Lynch and Christopher Gadsden, who  were active in the Provincial government and later leaders in the American  Revolution; all were commemorated.

                Charleston’s French Quarter neighborhood’s name  recognizes the high concentration of French merchants in the area's history.  It was settled as part of the original Grande  Modell of Charles Towne in 1680. It is famous for its art galleries; it also  has many restaurants and places of commerce as well as Charleston's  Waterfront Park.
               </p>
               <p>
                Charleston's French Quarter is home to many fine  historic buildings, among them, the Pink House Tavern, built around 1712, and  the Slave Mart, built by Z.B. Oakes in 1859. Also in the French Quarter are the  Dock Street Theatre, arguably the first site of theatrical productions in the United States, and the French  Huguenot Church,  a beautiful Gothic-style church which houses the sole-surviving French  Calvinist Congregation in the United    States. St. Philip's Episcopal Church, the  first congregation in Charleston,  whose current building dates to 1835, is also in the French Quarter. St.  Philip's cemetery is the final resting place of Edward Rutledge, the youngest  signer of the Declaration of Independence, and U.S. Senator and Vice President  John C. Calhoun, whose large tomb is empty; his bones were removed during the  Civil War to protect them from capture by invading Union forces, and have never  been recovered.

                Charleston’s Ansonborough neighborhood was named  after Lord Anson of England who  won the property in a spirited poker game with famous Charlestonian Thomas Gadsden.  Lord Anson  was sent to Charleston in 1724 to protect the  coast of South Carolina  from pirates.  Admiral Anson was by no means a mere gentleman with a title;  he was an exceptional sailor by any standard.  He was the third Englishman  to circumnavigate the globe. On his many voyages he captured Spanish ships  filled with treasures.  The most celebrated being in the mid-1740's when  he abducted a Spanish vessel carrying booty worth a million and a quarter  pounds of sterling.

                Charleston’s Radcliffeborough neighborhood began  as farmland purchased and surveyed by Thomas Radcliffe in 1786. Thomas’ estate  and his widow, Lucretia continued to develop the borough after Thomas was lost  at sea in 1806.  In 1811, the Third  Episcopal Church was built on four lots donated by Mrs. Radcliffe for this  purpose. St. Paul’s convenient local and grand appearance attracted rice  planters from the neck to worship alongside homes built by merchants and  mechanics, several free black families (from before the Civil War) as well as  slaves living apart from their masters and after the war, newly freed slaves.
               </p>
               <p>
                Today,  Radcliffeborough is as racially and economically mixed as it was then but its  boundaries have grown from its original eight blocks to span from King Street to Ashley Avenue and  from Bee Street,  to Calhoun. It's topography has changed as well and would seem incredibly  different to Thomas Radcliffe. In his time and even up to 1846, Calhoun Street did  not exist. The area that would eventually become Calhoun was a millpond and  Comings Creek ran through the land where the Cathedral of St. Paul now stands.

Developed in the 18th century by the antebellum elite who wanted  "Villas" outside the Walled   City, Mazyck-Wraggborough  remains a repository of Museum quality houses. This borough is sought-after by  buyers who appreciate fine architecture, but do not want to spend the prices of  neighborhoods further south. Mazyck-Wraggborough is convenient for those liking  to walk. Shopping on Saturday's at the Farmer's Market is a fun, social outing.  For smart shops, award winning chefs, and the latest martini, King Street is just  a short stroll away!

                Charleston’s Hampton Park Terrace is a  neighborhood located in peninsular Charleston,   South Carolina.  The land upon which the neighborhood is built  was rural land until approximately 1900. At about that time, a few streets  began being laid out in the northern end of the city. A few small houses were  constructed at that time, but most of the land remained undeveloped. In 1912,  three large sections of the neighborhood were platted. Those sections roughly  correspond to the northwest quadrant, the southwest quadrant, and the southeast  quadrant.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most of the  housing in the neighborhood was constructed between 1912 and 1925. The  architecture of the neighborhood follows national trends of the period and  represents a distinct break from the local tradition of Charleston's other  historic areas.  Nevertheless, because of  its largely intact concentration of early 20th century buildings, the  neighborhood was added to the National Register on September 26, 1997.
