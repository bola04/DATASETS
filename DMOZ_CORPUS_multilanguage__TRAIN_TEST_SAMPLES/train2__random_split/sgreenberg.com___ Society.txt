      <p>
       Extensive expert witness testimony and lending experience brings an "insiders" understanding of how commercial 
                     banks operate. Whether it is bank-lending regulations, bank lending practices, or lender liability issues ranging 
                     from loan commitments to loan defaults or loan restructure / workout issues to interest rates and bankruptcy, 
                     this knowledge will help to maximize legal results for the client.
