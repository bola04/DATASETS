                  Rowena has boldly steered the brands under her stewardship across the high seas of conformity into exciting waters; steadily building a body of work that has been celebrated as much for its creativity, as it has for effectiveness. She has helmed successful global brands including Singapore Tourism Board and Citibank; premium regional brands like Audi; and local bodies like UNIFEM and the Breast Cancer Foundation. Her inspired, nurturing leadership has been an anchor for many talents at DDB and the wind in the sails for many more to come into their own. Rowena believes that ‘impossible is nothing’, that this industry is as much about people as it is about ideas, and that an unwavering eye on results can open up new horizons for brands.
