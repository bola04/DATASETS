      Waterfall 2006
     </h1>
     <p>
      After years of being disparaged by some in the software development community, the
 			waterfall process is back with a vengeance. You've always known a good waterfall-based
 			process is the right way to develop software projects. Come to the Waterfall 2006 conference
 			and see how a sequential development process can benefit your next project.
 			Learn how slow, deliberate handoffs (with signatures!) between groups can slow the 
 			rate of change on any project so that development teams have more time to spend on 
 			anticipating user needs through big, upfront design.

      Because it's possible you may want to attend all sessions, Waterfall 2006 features no 
 			concurrent sessions. All sessions are run sequentially for your enjoyment. However, since in a waterfall
 			process we don't want testers to know anything about coding, or programmers to know anything about design, 
 			and so on, you can only attend sessions that match your job function. When you
      <a href="register.html">
       register to attend
      </a>
      you'll be asked to select an appropriate job function. 
 			When sessions that are not relevant to you are running you will be required to sit idle in the lobby.
     </p>
     <br/>

      The conference will also feature a number of workshops. Unlike typical conferences where workshops involve
 			participants talking with each other, all Waterfall 2006 workshops will be conducted by document. Come to 
 			a workshop, open up your favorite word processor and state your opinion on something. Email it to other workshop
 			participants. (We'll set up mailing list aliases for this--after all, we want to keep this process efficient!) 
 			Then just sit back and wait for someone to reply with their own document. Don't miss this opportunity to 
 			participate in vigorous written discussion with your peers. The following workshops are planned:
