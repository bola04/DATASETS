          <p>
           Bulmers is Irish through and through. Made from 17 varieties of Irish apples and produced in Clonmel, Co Tipperary, Ireland's leading cider has all the traits and personality of an iconic brand. While it will never lose its inherent Irishness, the brand has been given a radical make-over. From how our product is crafted to personality, Bulmers is 100% Irish Cider.

           </h3>
           <p>
            Using statistics to make sharp observations about life in Ireland, our new advertising campaign takes a humorous look at people's thoughts on a wide variety of cultural and societal subjects. From a DJ who only understands what 8% of the buttons on his decks actually do, to a guy in a suit dancing who is 91% sure he's at the wrong party. Regardless of the stats, one thing that always remains the same is Bulmers – 100% Irish Cider.

            Our New Look
           </h3>
           <p>
            Our new copper-toned packaging has been inspired by the warm tones of the liquid colour of the cider, the russet skin of a ripe apple and even the beautifully-crafted industrial equipment used in the cider-making process. The new brand identity still features the cider vats, which are synonymous with the Bulmers brand but this time round, the vats have a more contemporary, edgier feel and are manifested in the linear design of the artwork. The effect is a modern and clean look and a radical change of direction for the Bulmers brand.

         Drinking alcohol is part of everyday adult life in Ireland. It is used to celebrate, commiserate and to socialise. Used sensibly alcohol is a pleasurable, socially acceptable drug.
        </p>
        <h2>
         What is a standard drink?
        </h2>
        <p>
         In Ireland a standard drink has about 10 grams of pure alcohol in it. In the UK a standard drink, also called a unit of alcohol, has about 8 grams of pure alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here are some examples of a standard drink.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          A pub measure of spirits (35.5ml)
         </li>
         <li>
          A small glass of wine (12.5% volume)
         </li>
         <li>
          A half pint of normal beer
         </li>
         <li>
          An alcopop (275ml bottle)
         </li>
         <li>
          A bottle of wine at 12.5% alcohol contains about seven standard drinks.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
         What are the low-risk drinking guidelines?
        </h2>
        <p>
         Low risk weekly guidelines for adults are:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          up to 11 standard drinks in a week for women, and
         </li>
         <li>
          up to 17 standard drinks in a week for men.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Drinks should be spaced out over the week, not consumed in one sitting. Drinking more than the safe levels may cause harm.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Remember
         </strong>
         , drinks measures are not always the same. What you get in a pub and what you pour for yourself could be very different.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          These weekly limits do not apply to teenagers or to people who are pregnant, ill, run-down or on medication. It is healthier for teenagers not to drink alcohol.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <h2>
         What is a binge?
        </h2>
        <p>
         Binge drinking is a term used to describe an occasion when we drink too much. It is when we have 6 or more standard drinks. Binge drinking is a form of harmful drinking that is likely to increase our risk of accidents, injuries, violence and poisoning.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Having more than 5 standard drinks at a time can seriously increase the harmful effects of drinking.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <h2>
         <strong>
          How long do the effects of drinking last?
         </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
         In general you start to feel the effects of alcohol within 5 or 10 minutes of drinking. It then takes about one hour for every standard drink you take to work through your system.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Tips for drinking less
        </h2>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Going out tonight? Here are some tips on how you can drink less.
         </li>
         <li>
          Don't drink alcohol before you go out.
         </li>
         <li>
          Buy smaller drinks â€“ have a glass instead of a pint, a single instead of a double.
         </li>
         <li>
          Leave your glass down between sips.
         </li>
         <li>
          Wait a while before getting another drink.
         </li>
         <li>
          Have a glass of water or try some alcohol free beers, larger or cocktails in between alcoholic drinks.
         </li>
         <li>
          Occupy yourself â€“ play pool, dance, chat.
         </li>
         <li>
          Try not to get into rounds â€“ or if you can't avoid a round buy yourself a non alcoholic drink when it is your turn.
         </li>
         <li>
          Don't play drinking games.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
         Home measures
        </h2>
        <p>
         Home measures tend to be a lot larger than pub ones.  If you are offered a drink when visiting someone, try a bottle or a can instead of a short.  It is easier to watch what you are having.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Know your limits
        </h2>
        <p>
         If you are honest, you know the point where you start to lose control, or behave differently because of alcohol.  Your main target should be not to have more than this.
