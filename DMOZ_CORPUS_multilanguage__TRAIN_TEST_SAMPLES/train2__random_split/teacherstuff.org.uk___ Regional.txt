      These pages contain many resources for teachers which we have made ourselves.
      <br/>
      There are also links to education sites where you can find planning, policies,
      <br/>
      software reviews, worksheets, games and activities for children, publisher and author pages,
      <br/>
      and a great deal more.......
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We have pages for parents too, with links to information and advice in childcare.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And of course we have not forgotten the children!
      <br/>
      We have games for them to play,
 pictures to download and colour, songs to sing, activities and puzzles to do.
      <br/>
