    When Rafael Sabatini is mentioned 
          most people think of high adventure, sword-fighting and damsels in 
          distress. This isn't surprising since his most famous works have been 
          translated into the classic swashbuckling films
    <i>
     Captain Blood
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     Scaramouche
    </i>
    . However, these books represent a small fraction of Sabatini's work.
          A popular author during his lifetime, he produced 31 novels, 8 short 
          novel/short story collections, 6 nonfiction books, numerous 
          short stories, and a play.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sabatini's writing, usually fiction in a historic setting,
          explores political intrigue, religion, and the place of chivalry and
          honor, while entertaining with clever dialogue, deftly drawn
          characters and action sequences as vivid and thrilling as modern
          movies.
