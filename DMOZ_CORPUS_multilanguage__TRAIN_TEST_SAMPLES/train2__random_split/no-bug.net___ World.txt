    <strong>
     With regret, we’ve made the decision to close down Flavors.me.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    We fully appreciate how frustrating this is. It took a great amount of deliberation and discussion to reach this difficult decision. But, recent issues with Flavors forced us to look very carefully at the service we provide and we no longer feel we can offer a robust service into the future. We’ve now retired our hosting and web-builder services.
