   <p>
    I have given up the battle of fighting the spambots and human spammers that make up 99% of the traffic to this site. The anti-spam measures I had in place were barely slowing them down, and just causing troubles for the select few real musicians who tried to use this free service.

    <strong>
     Sorry for any inconvenience to those musicians who had posted ads and were legitimately trying to use this site!
