                 Farm Museum celebrates the early days of Alberta farming. Find 
                 your rural roots as you explore Red Deer's oldest farm! Imagine 
                 the lives of pioneer farm families - working in the field, milking 
                 the family cow in the dairy barn, repairing a plow in the blacksmith 
                 shop, or baking bread in the summer kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
           Join us as we travel back in time. Chat with "men at work" in 
                 the restoration shop. Experience the modern conveniences - of 
                 1905 - on a visit to the log house. Try your hand at feeding chickens 
                 and enjoy a wagon ride, special event of demonstration of lovingly 
                 restored farming equipment (seasonal).
