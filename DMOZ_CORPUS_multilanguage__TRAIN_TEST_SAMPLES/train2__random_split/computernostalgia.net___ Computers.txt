            It makes sense to go back and see how it all started! Hardware has always played a major role in the history of the computer, and the computer's motherboard (or system board) is where most of the computer's electronics are located. For example, the motherboard contains the microprocessor, the memory, expansion slots, the hard disk interface, and so on.
           </p>
           <p class="indent">
            <span style="color: #8E58A4; font-size: 11.000000pt; font-weight: Bold;">
             M
            </span>
            ost computers can be expanded or extended in some way, for example, you can normally add more memory or perhaps a new hard disk. If you are looking for new hardware, you can shop for high quality wholesale
            <a href="http://www.dhgate.com/wholesale/laptop+motherboards.html">
             laptop motherboard products from China on DHgate.com
            </a>
            . Of course, as well as the computers themselves, there are plenty of other types of hardware such as printers, scanners, fax machines, expansion cards, and so on.

         n 1994, the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda passed the Free Trade &amp; Processing act, allowing licences to be granted to organisations applying to open online casinos. Before online casinos, the first fully functional gambling software was developed by Microgaming, an Isle of Man-based software company. This was secured with software developed by CryptoLogic, an online security software company. Safe transactions became viable and this led to the first online casinos appearing in 1994. 1996 saw the establishment of the Kahnawake Gaming Commission, which regulated online gaming activity from the Mohawk Territory of Kahnawake and issues gaming licences to many of the world's online casinos and poker rooms. This is an attempt to keep the operations of licensed online gambling organisations fair and transparent. In 1995, the website

         he first slot machine was invented by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California, U.S. Most people agree that Fey invented the machine in 1887, however some believe that he may have conceived the machine in 1895. Due to the vast number of possible wins with the original poker card based game, it proved practically impossible to come up with a way to make a machine capable of making an automatic payout for all possible winning combinations. Charles Fey devised a machine with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols - horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts, and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.

         t has been reported that Poker was first played in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1829, with a deck of 20 cards, and four players betting on which player's hand was the most valuable. Jonathan H. Green's book,
         <i>
          An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling (G. B. Zieber, Philadelphia, 1843)
         </i>
         , described the spread of the game from there to the rest of the country by Mississippi riverboats, on which gambling was a common pastime. As it spread north along the Mississippi River and to the West during the gold rush, it is thought to have become a part of the frontier pioneer ethos.

         oon after this spread, the full 52-card English deck was used and the flush was introduced. The draw was added prior to 1850 (when it was first mentioned in print in a handbook of games). During the American Civil War, many additions were made including stud poker (specifically five-card stud), and the straight. Further American developments followed, such as the wild card (around 1875), lowball and split-pot poker (around 1900), and community card poker games (around 1925).

         he first modern programming language is hard to identify. From the start, the restrictions of the hardware defined the language. Punch cards allowed 80 columns, but some of the columns had to be used for a sorting number on each card. Fortran included some keywords which were the same as English words, such as "IF", "GOTO" (go to) and "CONTINUE". The use of a magnetic drum for memory meant that computer programs also had to be interleaved with the rotations of the drum. Thus the programs were more hardware dependent than today.

         or many years, hard disks were large devices more suited to use in the protected environment of a data center or large office than in a harsh industrial environment, or small office or home. Before the early 1980s, most hard disks had 8-inch (20 cm) or 14-inch (35 cm) platters, required an equipment rack or a large amount of floor space (especially the large removable-media drives, which were often referred to as "washing machines"), and in many cases needed high-amperage or even three-phase power hookups due to the large motors they used.
