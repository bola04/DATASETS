         There are many things that can take hold of one's soul and wipe it out, but, 
 there is also one thing that can always take that soul back; resurrect it, 
 renew it, and continually maintain it.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Through these pages you will find an account of that which came to wipe my 
 soul away. As you journey within, may you also see what took hold of me, 
 stood me back on my feet, and gave me reason to dance. Amongst these fallen 
 leaves, may you find yourself dancing with me.
