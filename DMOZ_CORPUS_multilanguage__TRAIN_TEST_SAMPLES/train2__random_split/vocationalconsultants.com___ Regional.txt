      <h2>
       vocational evaluation
      </h2>
      <p>
       Vocational evaluation is a process in which a vocationally 
 			trained expert meets with an individual to gather information in 
 			order to evaluate that persons vocational potential.  Through a 
 			combination of interview, vocational testing, situational 
 			assessment, records review and resource survey, the evaluator can 
 			guide the individual toward (or away from) specific jobs, fields of 
 			interest or ability, vocational training, courses of study or 
 			placement. Vocational evaluations are used in personal injury, 
 			college major selection, WCC, SSA, and even divorce situations ( 
 			alimony / child support).  The process can be requested by the 
 			individual, a lawyer or even the court depending on the need(s) of 
 			the parties and the situation.  The outcome of a vocational 
 			evaluation may be a report, counseling with the individual, or 
 			testimony in court as to the findings.

      <h2>
       vocational assessment
      </h2>
      <p>
       Vocational assessment is similar to vocational evaluation but is 
 			done without direct contact with the individual.  The evaluator 
 			uses information about the person gathered from other sources, when 
 			the individual is not available or is uncooperative.  Given 
 			enough information, a reasonable assessment can be made that can be 
 			presented in report form or court testimony.  Assessments are 
 			often used in situations where there is a question about lost income 
 			(wages) due to death, illness or injury and the individual is not 
 			available to the vocational evaluator. Assessments are also used in 
 			separation and divorce situations where there is a question about 
 			income potential (although having the parties work things out 
 			through mediation is obviously better).

       vocational counseling
      </h2>
      <p>
       Vocational counseling is a process in which a vocationally 
 			trained professional meets with an individual (usually over several 
 			sessions) to help them focus on vocational issues such as job 
 			change, college major, return to work after time away (or job change 
 			due to injury or illness), job seeking skills, interview skills or 
 			resume writing. The vocational counselor can help the individual 
 			explore option, alternatives and resources so that decisions can be 
 			based on useful information.

      <h3>
       Expert Witness
       <a name="witness">
       </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Vocational consultants and independent rehabilitation specialists can provide 
 expert testimony in personal injury, WCC, SSA, and divorce cases after 
 appropriate information about the individual(s) have been gathered.  Art 
 and Martin each have over 25 years experience in the area of rehabilitation and 
 vocational expert testimony.  Each is under contract with SSA to provide 
 neutral expert testimony.  Each has done over 1000 SSA cases.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Job Potential
      </h3>
      <p>
       One of the most frequently asked questions in social security, disability and 
 divorce cases is, "What is the individual's job potential?".  That is, what 
 kinds of work can a person do and what is the likelihood that they will be 
 employed in these positions. After an evaluation or assessment, vocational 
 consultants can do the related research to help explore what kinds of work, if 
 any, an individual can perform and where do these jobs exist.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Income Potential - Disability
      </h3>
      <p>
       Directly related to job potential is income potential.  How much, if 
 anything, can an individual earn, given the limitations describes by the 
 individual and verified by professional sources.  using both published 
 documents and internet resources, Vocational Consultants is able to provide this 
 information for use in a number of situations.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Income Potential - Divorce
      </h3>
      <p>
       Divorce cases provide their own set of variables, needs and positions.  
 Vocational Consultants is able to provide information and expert testimony in 
 situations regarding child support, alimony, long-term disability and even long 
 term child support.  Processes and procedures are similar to those used in 
 disability cases, only the use of the information is different.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Loss of Income
      </h3>
      <p>
       One of the issues often considered by vocational consultants is loss of 
 income.  This is often related to issues of personal injury or disability 
 in which an individual is no longer able to perform at previous work levels.  
 When this question arises, Vocational Consultants can look at current work 
 potential and compare that with past work and income so that changes in income 
 potential can be evaluated.  Vocational Consultants can provide straight 
 line projections for loss of income.  Economists who specialize in this 
 type of work can be consulted for more detailed consideration.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Social Security Disability
      </h3>
      <p>
       Vocational consultants &amp; independent rehabilitation specialists can provide 
 case consultation as well as vocational evaluations in Social Security 
 disability cases where the claimant or representative is looking for a neutral 
 opinion with regard to an individual's ability to work based on age, education, 
 past work experience and current limitations.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Martin Kranitz has been a vocational expert for Social Security administration 
 for twenty-four years.  As such, his opinion is highly respected by both 
 the administration and other vocational experts.  Martin can provide either 
 a vocational evaluation or assessment depending on your needs.
      </p>
