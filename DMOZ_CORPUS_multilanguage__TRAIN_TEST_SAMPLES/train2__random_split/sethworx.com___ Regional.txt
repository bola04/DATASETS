       'The Nature of Personal Reality' is probably the most important book that Seth, Jane Roberts and Robert Butts produced. Within its pages Seth provides profound insights into the nature of reality and an understanding of the inscription above the ancient Oracle that once stood at Delphi, which advocated; Know Your Self.
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       The essence of the Seth Material can be contained within the phrase, "We each create our own personal reality and the point of power is the present moment". However, understanding the full implications of this deceptively simple phrase requires a complete reassessment of our world, our lives, and what we truly are.
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       There are many inspiring quotes contained within the Seth books, the following are a few of our favourites:
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       If these quotes inspire you, the life-changing book, The Nature Of Reality by NoR, will show you how to put the inspiration into action.
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       You really can change your life!
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       'The Nature Of Reality' by NoR is available from Amazon as a book, an MP3 audio download, a double CD set or as a Kindle download.

       "If a man wants to change his fate, desire is not enough, but expectation is. Desire may grow into expectation, but alone it is not enough."
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       "All probable worlds exist now, all probable variations on the most minute aspect in any reality exist now. You weave in and out of probabilities constantly, picking and choosing as you go along."
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       "You cannot separate your beliefs about reality from the reality you experience. Your beliefs about reality form it. Your ideas about what is possible and what is not possible are reflected in all areas."
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       "No event is predestined. Any given event can be changed not only before and during but after its occurrence. An individual's future actions are not dependent upon a concrete finished past, for such a past never existed."
      </p>
      <p class="mainbody">
       "You cannot justify or rationalise present circumstances by saying, 'This is because of something I did in a past life,' for within yourself now is the ability to change negative influences. You may have brought negative influences into your life for a given reason, but the reason always has to do with understanding, and understanding removes those influences."
