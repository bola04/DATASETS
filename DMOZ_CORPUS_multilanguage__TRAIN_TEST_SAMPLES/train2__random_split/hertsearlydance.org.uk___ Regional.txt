      Herts Early Dance was founded in 2002 as a social club for all those interested in the
     dances and music of earlier times. Dancers and musicians meet about every three weeks in
     St Albans.  Most meetings are led by either our principal tutor, Anne Daye, or another
     experienced tutor. The dances are selected from a wide range of styles and periods mainly
     focusing on the 15th to 17th centuries.

      The highlight of the year is the
      <b>
       <i>
        May Revels
       </i>
      </b>
      , when members enjoy a feast,
     entertainments and dancing, and period costume is worn.

      Most of our meetings are much less formal and we warmly welcome new dancers of all standards.
     We seek to offer a light hearted, enjoyable and sociable setting for developing our
     understanding of historical dance and its context.
