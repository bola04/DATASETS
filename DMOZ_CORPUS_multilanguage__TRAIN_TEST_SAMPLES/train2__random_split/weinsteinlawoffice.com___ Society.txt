           <p>
            For over 20 years my divorce law firm has represented thousands of folks in Middlesex and Monmouth counties. In fact, we have handled family law related matters throughout the state of New Jersey. All told, our divorce attorneys have nearly 60 years of legal experience regarding divorce, child custody and all other areas encompassed within the realm of family law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Each divorce and family law case has unique facts and nuances that often require a comprehensive legal analysis. Therefore, at The Law Offices of Edward R. Weinstein, we employ a “teamwork” philosophy.

              Alimony
             </a>
             : On September 10, 2014,
             <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/" target="_blank">
              Governor Christie
             </a>
             signed a bill into law that has resulted in a major overhaul of alimony laws in the state of New Jersey. The legislative intent was to “modernize” New Jersey’s alimony laws. These changes include the elimination of permanent alimony in our state. Furthermore, the law of alimony and cohabitation (when the recipient of alimony is living with a new significant other) has been updated to make New Jersey’s alimony laws much more fair to the person paying alimony.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether you intend to receive pay alimony or have the exposure to pay alimony, our skilled Monmouth county divorce attorneys shall evaluate all financial circumstances to negotiate a fair and equitable deal. Notwithstanding the modernization of New Jersey alimony laws, this is still one of the most emotional and complex of all divorce issues. Family law mediators or attorneys can help you understand and negotiate a very successful financial future.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is important to note that this new law takes effect immediately and does not allow for modification of previous Final Judgment of Divorce, or subsequent Court Orders. While I have spoken with many of the New Jersey family law attorneys who actually drafted the new alimony laws, ultimately I feel this was both a compromise in order to achieve other goals related to the new law. Otherwise, the entire bill would have died.
            </p>
            <p>
             As my office shall continue to the Family Courts to see how they evaluate and apply this new alimony law in New Jersey, please do not ever hesitate to call, email, or

             : After your divorce is final you may come to find that certain agreements are not working or your “ex” may not be complying with the terms of your settlement agreement or New Jersey Family Court Order. You or your ex-spouse may have had a change of life circumstances or perhaps someone is not abiding by original agreements. Regardless of the problems, skilled family law mediators can help you renegotiate support (alimony or child custody) amongst other items, or our attorneys can assist in litigating any custody issues.

             : On October 22, 2013, Governor Chris Christie ended the battle against “gay marriage” by not appealing a judge’s ruling that allowed same-sex couples to wed in the state of New Jersey. This was a huge milestone in the gay and lesbian community and changed the way same-sex couples were viewed in New Jersey. Our New Jersey family law lawyers also have expertise with adoptions, reproductive issues, and can help to ensure that both partners have equal rights for parenting children.
