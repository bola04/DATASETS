        Geoff is in the middle of writing his memoirs. His career spans half a century and he has an amazing story to tell. Of course the story is far from over. He is also developing a multi-media project which will tell the story of the Welsh mining industry in song, verse, dance and film. It is a tale of courage, pride, passion, tragedy and hope. He will be collaborating with, among others, Welsh poet and performer

         Transience
        </i>
        is on Fuzzy Moon Records (FUZ008) and was released by Proper on April 1, 2016. Of this highly emotional album Geoff writes:
        <i>
         "Recorded seven months after my mother's passing, my intense sense of loss has very much informed the emotional landscape of the music. Losing a loved-one makes one realise just how precious, fragile and transient life is. Furthermore, in the last year or so we have lost so many musical luminaries, none more brilliant than those two beacons of infinite light - Kenny Wheeler and John Taylor. This has brought the sentiments of this album into even greater focus for me."
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        On the CD Geoff is joined by four leading lights of the contemporary jazz scene, all of them superb improvisers in their own right: Brigitte Beraha (voice), Noel Langley (trumpet/flugelhorn), Chris Laurence (double bass) and Martin France (drums).
