           When Racewalk.com launched back in the early days of the internet, it was also the early days of race walking products. Few books were in print and virtually no video resources were available to help learn race walking. Over the past 20 years, we've helped fill the void. Please visit our complete race walking shop which is of course the place to get the best books, and DVDs about race walking. Whether you are competitive or just a recreational walker looking to maximize your workout, racewalk.com and its products are perfect for you.

               The 2016 Penn Relays was a bittersweet moment for my involvement with the Penn Relays. I first competed 30 years ago as a freshman at Drexel University. In 1991 I took over as the coordinator for the race walks. The events have gone through a series of changes and certainly many challenges, however year after year the women's field has grown stronger and stronger. This is particularly true for the junior and high school events. They have always been my focus and I am pleased to say the women responded with amazing quality. Unfortunately, while we have a few high quality men in the 10km, the depth hasn't been there since the loss of the NY high school race walking program.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align:left">
               This year is notable, because I passed the baton to Solomiya Logan. For the past two years she learned all the nuances of putting on the race walks at the relays and this year she took over completely. She did a marvelous job and handled many unique challenges that we faced. As the years go forward, please offer her your patience and appreciation as it's our volunteers that keep the sport alive. I am very happy to see Solomiya carry on a tradition that I may have been the spokesperson for, but really represented a lot of hard work by my local walkers as well as the parents who volunteered to help over the year. Many of the dedicated judges are continuing and without their hard work and skill we couldn't have events of this quality. Thanks to all of you for giving me such great memories. Don't worry however, I'll be back as media and taking more photos and videos than ever. Enjoy!

          Hot weather has been the order of the day for endurance events in California during the past year. Leading up to this event, there had been a brief cooling trend, but the weather gods decided otherwise. The Marathon Olympic Team Trials in Los Angeles occurred the previous weekend with temperatures reaching the mid 70s by noon. This event's forecast was for cool overnight lows in the mid 40s with daytime highs into the high 70s. The day looked to be sunny with mild winds. And sure enough, it was in the mid 40s at the 7:20 a.m. start with temps into the 70s by late morning into the afternoon.

           Santee once again is the location for the USATF 50K Nationals for race walking. The 2015 event also included additional shorter distances of 5K, 10K, and 20K. With the 50K Olympic Trials for race walking coming up on February 21, 2016 on this same course, this could be a preview of who could or will make the 2016 Olympic team in three race walk events: 50K Men and 20K Men/Women.

For the open men and women, the top five American finishers would win a berth on the USA Pan America Cup Race Walking team scheduled to compete in Arica, Chile May 9th – May 11th. In addition, the top three junior men and women would also win berths. All berths are subject to minimum time standards.

Video data from two 3CCD camcorders of athletes competing over 10 km (juniors only), 20 km, and 50 km were collected at three international competitions. For the 20 km and 50 km events, multiple recordings were made to identify if kinematic changes occurred. Although race walking provides a wealth of advantages to running, cycling or

           The 2014 Men's Penn Relays race walk was shaping up to be one of the deepest fields in a long time, but unfortunately we had four scratches at the last minute. With heavy downpours the night before, we lucked out and had picture perfect weather for the start of the race. Sunny, cool, and with little wind, the small field hit the track hard. With three men under 45:00, the race was a success.

           The 2014 Women's Penn Relays race walk was an historic event. While we always favored junior/high school walkers over open and masters athletes, there was never a year so youth centric as 2014. With a limit of 25 athletes on the track, there were only 2 open athletes and one very prestigious masters athlete. The other 22 qualifying athletes were all junior and high school walkers. When I took the Penn Relays over 24 years ago, the time standard for the junior/high school women was 32:00. This year it was 28:00.

           The weather couldn't have been less pleasant. OK, a bit of an exaggeration, but it was not a bright sunny day for sure. Ron Salvio could not have been more prepared for the weather and a top notch trials race. Organization was impeccable, the course looked great, and every issue seemed to have been prethoughout. It was also a great day for USA race walking. Admittedly, I wasn't too motivated to roll out of bed for a cold (45 degrees) rainy March march.

            Imagine forging your way through fog-laden forests in the high Andes, camping along 600 year-old Inca trails, climbing 13,000-foot passes, and braving rain storms as your trail turns to slippery mud. After four days, you wake up in the early morning and walk two miles in the darkness to an overlook awaiting the sunrise. Within minutes the clouds lift and rays of golden light begin to uncover one of the planet’s most majestic ruins. Machu Picchu’s stone secrets are slowly revealed in the breaking dawn. This is just one of the many adventures you can experience by visiting
