            Frederick T. Zugibe, Ph.D., M.D. passed away on 
 						Friday, September 6 at age 85. In 1969 he was appointed 
 						the first chief medical examiner of Rockland County 
 						replacing the old coroner system. He served as 
 						Rockland's chief medical examiner for 34 years retiring 
 						in 2003. During his tenure, the Rockland Medical 
 						Examiner's Office gained an international reputation in 
 						the field of forensic science and innovative techniques 
 						and inventions still in use.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Zugibe was born on May 28, 1928 in Garnerville, 
 						NY to Benjamin and Zarick Zugibe. He is survived by 
 						Catherine (O'Leary), his wife of 62 years, and six of 
 						his seven children: Thomas (Peggy), Cathryn Blaber 
 						(Thomas), Theresa Mandracchia (Stephen) Mary Raleigh 
 						(Peter), Matthew (Carol) and Kevin Zugibe. His son 
 						Thomas is Rockland County’s District Attorney.
            <br/>
            Dr. Zugibe was predeceased by his son Frederick T. 
 						Zugibe, M.D. (Anna) in 2006. He is survived by 18 
 						grandchildren and five great grandchildren.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was a parishioner at St. Peter’s Roman Catholic 
 						Church in Haverstraw, member of the Secular Franciscan 
 						Order. In 2002, he was received as a knight in the 
 						papally approved Order of Our Lady of the Conception of 
 						Vila Vicosa in Portugal.
            <br/>
            Dr. Zugibe graduated from Haverstraw High School and St. 
 						Francis College. He earned a Masters Degree from 
 						Columbia University and a Ph.D. in anatomy and 
 						histochemistry from the University of Chicago. After 
 						having seven children, he returned to school and 
 						obtained his M.D. degree from West Virginia University 
 						in 1968 and became Board Certified in Anatomic and 
 						Forensic Pathology.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Zugibe was internationally lauded in the field of 
 						cardiovascular research and discovered several diseases 
 						that had never before been identified. He was a fellow 
 						in the American College of Cardiology and Board 
 						Certified in Family Practice. He also had an active 
 						medical practice during his tenure as Medical Examiner, 
 						specializing in cardiology.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Zugibe was an author known for his scientific 
 						research on the Shroud of Turin and the mechanism and 
 						cause of death of Jesus appearing in numerous 
 						documentaries in connection with his research. He wrote 
 						The Crucifixion of Jesus, a Forensic Inquiry and 
 						Dissecting Death: Secrets of a Medical Examiner and 
 						other books and papers. He also served as adjunct 
 						Associate Professor of Pathology at Columbia University 
 						College of Physicians and Surgeons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Zugibe established the first disaster response 
 						protocol for Rockland County, coordinating training 
 						among all law enforcement, medical and emergency 
 						response teams and conducting EMT classes. As medical 
 						examiner, he established protocols to support the 
 						donation of organs and corneas, while still maintaining 
 						the integrity of Anna death investigations. In 1972, he 
 						joined relief efforts in Nicaragua providing medical 
 						care to earthquake victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether it was comforting a victim's family at the 
 						scene of an investigation, responding to a medical 
 						emergency, or giving his time and support to innumerable 
 						individuals and groups who needed his help, Dr. Zugibe 
 						worked tirelessly on behalf of those in need and in 
 						service to the community. He was devoted to his family 
 						and took immense pleasure and pride in their endeavors. 
 						His vast knowledge and accomplishments were only 
 						surpassed by his compassion for the suffering of others 
 						and the love of and for his family.

             INTRODUCTION
            </b>
           </p>
           <p>
            In pursuing the truth in specialized areas of research, things are not always what they seem to be. This is especially true in Shroud and crucifixion research where the literature is badly contaminated by papers written by individuals who have expertise in one area but publish and lecture outside their areas of expertise and those well intentioned, ubiquitous dilettantes without any expertise at all who dominate the field and publish and speculate in some or in all areas of shroud research. The former reminds me of the derivation of the word ultracrepidarian; Alexander the Great’s artist, Appeles was criticized by a cobbler for the way he had drawn the latch of a sandal and Appeles immediately corrected it. Then the cobbler went on to criticize the subjects legs. Appeles snapped, “ Se supra crepidat judicaret” Let him not criticize above the sole. In this regard, many misconceptions have pervaded the literature, ad infinitum regarding the mechanism and cause of death by crucifixion, whether the palms could support the weight of the crucarius and where the hands were nailed during crucifixion. Despite our extensive suspension studies using sophisticated techniques that showed that there was no difficulty in breathing during suspension on the cross therefore precluding asphyxiation as the cause of death, there is still wide propagation, “polly parrot” style of Barbet’s a priori hypothesis that the crucarius had to rhythmically sag and straighten throughout the whole period of crucifixion in order to expel the air from the lungs ( 1, 2). Moreover, recent journal articles, lectures and television documentaries have repeatedly proclaimed Barbet’s hypothesis as fact that the palms of the hands could not support the weight of a crucarius during crucifixion and that the nails would tear right through the hands totally based on an invalidly interpreted experiment conducted by Barbet. When I read the voluminous literature based on Barbet’s sacrosanct speculations, I, sometimes wonder if I am not committing a sacrilege when I question them.
