        <strong>
         Ozark County, Missouri
        </strong>
        ... a single place that offers real estate with world class fishing and hunting, two magnificent unspoiled lakes for swimming, skiing, and boating, two spring fed rivers to canoe, with campgrounds, resorts, historic old mills, charming craft and antique shops, all properties that are far from the crowds and noise.
       </p>

        The "real" Ozarks is a great place to visit, it is an even better place to live. Owning land in Ozark County is an affordable dream. Unimproved, functional and accessible land is very available.  Unimproved timberland of 40 acres or more will have the least cost per acre, but choice property bordering Bull Shoals or Lake Norfork is very reasonable when compared to most urban areas. Houses range in type and size from vacation cabins to farm/ranch homes on acreage, to retirement dream homes overlooking the river or lake. A new home can be constructed for a comparatively low cost per square foot. The real estate taxes are some of the lowest in the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Springfield and Branson, Missouri, and Mountain Home Arkansas are all very close. Ozark County residents can access their urban facilities and return home to their quiet oasis.
