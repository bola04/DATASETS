             Best Technical Indicators For Day Trading
            </h2>
            <p>
             Indicators for day trading are a dime a dozen, we’ve all seen a million of them. And today I’m going to show you something that by the way also would apply for swing trading and, um, even long term treating frankly, if you put this on a monthly, weekly charts, you could do this for some real long-term trading and even investing, but today we’re going to show it to you on day trading examples and the indicators that we’re going to be using are the MACD and the Bollinger bands. These are some of the
             <i>
              best technical indicators
             </i>
             for day trading is that we’re going to use them in combination with each other. So it’s going to be an indicator of an indicator. Now, what did Barry mean by an indicator of an indicator? Good question.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, normally, when we are using Bollinger bands, were using them on the price bars. And that’s fine. I like to do that too. However, what we’ll do today is we’re going to look at MACD and by the way, the MACD settings that I’m using here is the standard 26, 12 and 9, and that’s what these red little Dots are. I put a plot of them as dots just so that I could see them very clearly, they would really stand out over against the lines of the Bollinger bands. Anyway, you can customize that however you want, but we are creating here instead of Bollinger bands of price, we’re creating Bollinger bands of the MACD indicator and the Bollinger bands are set again at the standard setting, which is generally two standard deviations of a 20 period moving average.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Best Combination of Indicators for Day Trading
            </h2>
            <p>
             Okay, so it didn’t really change any of these settings on the indicators, although we can play around that without if you want to as well. We’re creating a Bollinger band of the MACD instead of a Bollinger band of price action. How do we apply that? So here are the kinds of setups that I look for and give you a couple of examples on how to use these
             <u>
              best technical indicators
             </u>
             . First thing I will say is, since we’re talking about day trading today, and this is a three minute short, by the way, it doesn’t really mean it does matter, but, the first thing I want to tell you is that since we’re day trading early in the morning like this, I find that these signals are not necessarily as reliable. So I don’t take that first impulse move generally but I’m not going to tape because it normally doesn’t follow through.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s just sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t, but we’re trading probabilities and they find that most time it doesn’t. Therefore, I’m waiting for the next move. Now, what am I waiting for? I’m waiting for the typical kind of boundary band squeeze pattern where the upper and Bollinger bands squeeze together, right? They come close together just like that. And then the MACD hits the upper or lower level and I’m looking for that to then go long because we’re looking at this as a low volatility on MACD, and then we want it to start expanding and go to a high volatility. If it hits the upper one, we go long, if it hits the lower one, we go short and as you can see, sure enough, nice impulse move there. Got It. Nailed it. Now another thing to look for.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Day Trading Indicators Patterns
            </h2>
            <p>
             That’s the basic signal. First of all, that’s the basic signal. Now, the secondary signal you want to look at is, for example, here, we put in a high and look what happened, high on price, but look at a MACD, it pulls away from the Bollinger bands, right? Stops riding them. I call this riding the Bollinger bands. And then it lets loose of them. So that’s a nice indication of, that’s a high probability high and you get kind of the same thing down here, except we didn’t get an entry into that move, but here you might think maybe I should go along, maybe I should go short, but no, because the MACD doesn’t touch the lower Bollinger band. That is essentially telling us that the market is not making any strong impulse move to the downside and, therefore, not really going to be a great trade.
            </p>
            <p>
             And again that proved to be very true or could just kind of go sideways after that. Plus we don’t get the Bollinger bands to squeeze there. So let’s move forward here a little bit and again. What happens? We get these same patterns. Bollinger bands squeeze there, right? You gotta wait a little while. So the first time when we get this, you might say, well, but it hits the lower Bollinger band here. Yes, it does, but we don’t want to go short. Why? Because the squeeze is still just starting. So we want to take the trade out of the squeeze, not at the beginning of the squeeze, so we wait for it to get in there and then we for forward to start expanding and what you want to see are the Bollinger band starting to separate to part.
            </p>
            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p>
             So, when the lower goes down, the upper goes up, and then whichever one it hits, that’s the one that we’re looking for and momentum, remember MACD is, essentially, well traditionally it’s called a momentum indicator, but it’s really more of an acceleration or velocity indicator. But yes, we get a nice impulse move there and we are golden. So the type of trade, this actually is a volatility trade, but instead of using the Bollinger bands on price, we’re using it on a momentum indicator and it can sometimes give you different signals. Now, let me show you a couple more examples because I want to keep you out of trouble. It’s very important to learn the details of this. So we got it here. We went long and notice the same pattern, we put in a high. What happens is the MACD pulls away from the Bolinger band.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then we come back here. Now again, you might say, wait a minute. If the upper Bollinger band, I should go along. No. Why? Well, we already told you because the Bollinger band is squeezing together. The upper and lower bands are moving toward each other, so we don’t want that. Same thing here, they’re really just still kind of going sideways. And then now here it does go up toward the end of the day. In fact, that is the end of the day. We do get a little bit of an up move at the end of the day. One last example for you just to bring home the lesson. So again, beginning of the day, right? That’s this horizontal line is the beginning of the day. Just to be clear, by the way, these are California times down here. So again, we get the impulse move down.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Day Trading Rules
            </h2>
            <p>
             We do hit the lower Bollinger band, one of the best technical indicators. A couple of problems, number one, our rule is that first, impulse move at the beginning of the day, normally not good. Number two, it does touch the lower Bollinger band, but look, we’re not in the squeeze, right? We don’t have the squeeze first, so it’s disqualified on two counts. Now, here we do have the squeeze but we don’t want to take it right away because the squeeze is just starting. So the two Bollinger bands are coming together. We wait until they start parting and we get a little bit of a down move there. Now watch this, it comes back up, does not touch the upper Bollinger band, it comes up, comes back down, and it does make another impulse move down, right? The squeeze happens, look at this. If you could see this, that moves up.
            </p>
            <p>
             This one moves down, talking about the Bollinger bands. After which, this goes sideways for a little while. Then this is a point here where the Bollinger bands are clearly moving in opposite directions. They’re spreading apart, we got a momentum move, and we’re golden. So sure enough, again, one last thing, just to reiterate, we get a nice divergence there, it’s not really a divergence, but just MACD pulling away from the Bollinger band which means it’s slowing down. And then we wait for a nice candlestick pattern, we wait for resistance seeing that’s what you’re looking for, the confluence of time and price. We’ve got resistance, we got momentum slowing down slightly when resistance is going to hold – when momentum slows down because price tends to go through resistance when it’s moving on strength and it tends to bounce off of resistance when it’s moving up on weakness.

            <h2>
             Forex Breakout Strategy
            </h2>
            <p>
             Welcome to this FOREX trading training today, trading
             <u>
              breakout strategy
             </u>
             patterns, and this is based on, well in top dog trading, we call it the rule of three. I should mention that this will also work with futures and with stocks as well, but today we’re going to show it to you on FOREX, it’s a simple pattern, but it has a very profound psychological, logic behind it. So we look at a level such as this high, and we’re looking basically for a level that really stands out that a lot of people are going to see. This is a daily chart, by the way, therefore they’re going to see a big move appear. Big move down to there and this is important because this is why it works. It’s the mass psychology of it that a lot of people are going to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is a major swing high. Again, especially since it’s on a daily chart and lots of people look at daily charts, you’ve got masses of people seeing that high. Now, where the psychology comes into that is as the market comes back to approach that same level, you’re going to have three types of reactions, but they’re all based around the same issue that people are looking at that last high in saying that’s as high as the market would go. In other words, that’s the most people were willing to pay for this particular market. Now that we’re a few months out into the future here, the market remembers. It has a memory as people say. This is probably the best illustration of the market having a memory is people looking at that and saying back then we couldn’t get enough people to buy at a higher price.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Forex Daily Breakout Strategy
            </h2>
            <p>
             Think of it like I’m going to buy a car. And the car lot has 50, they have a particular model and they want to know they want to move those cars, of course. But nobody’s willing to pay more than what they’re asking. So everybody’s trying to get a deal or nobody’s just interested at that price at all, zero. What did they have to do? All the car dealerships going to lower the price, supply and demand, basic economics that people are watching that level and they’re going to say, ‘I wonder what the other people in the market are going to do when we get back to that price, we’ll send them that change’. Will there be people willing to pay more? But the doubt is there. That’s the key, doubt, hesitation, lack of confidence, lack of certainty in the masses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Therefore, it is most likely to fail. That is the one that the first attempt. Here’s the point, so this is the first time that we got up to this price level and then this is the second time and you’ll see that yes, it did get above it, but then it came right back below it. So it technically failed them. You couldn’t get a large number of people across the globe that have this plan, who we lovingly call earth to go ahead and pay more money, couldn’t get enough buying traction for the price to go up. So conversely, of course, the price goes down and that’s the psychology of it. Now, three things happen. As I mentioned on those three things are number one, some people are going to look at this price level and they’re going to say, ‘I’m just not gonna do anything right?’
            </p>
            <h2>
             Forex Breakout Strategy Rules
            </h2>
            <p>
             It’s coming up there. I’m thinking of buying. These will be your potential breakout traders and some people will buy. We did get some prices above there and so some people say, no, I’m looking to buy. And then, on the other hand, the same breakout traders will say, I’ll buy it literally. Technically if you’re going to account pips, it broke above that high, so you’re going to get some buyers. They get stopped out, they get screwed, right? Hate that. Nobody likes that false breakout. The number two thing that happens is that some people will short that and so they’re looking for this kind of pattern. They’re looking specifically for false breakouts.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think this is actually a better higher probability pattern to trade and they’re going to take a short and then you’ve got people who perhaps bought down here. This is group number three and group number three bought down here and I’m going to take profits into this level because they say ‘this is as high as we could go before, therefore, I’m going to lock in some profits there.’ Again, this is called the top dog trading rule of three and won’t even move forward a little bit more. We’ll squish up the chart a little bit so you can see the big picture. This is where the top dog trading rule of three comes in. So this again was the first. So this was the first time it reached that price level one. Less likely to continue. Could it continue?
            </p>
            <h2>
             Forex Trendline Breakout Strategy
            </h2>
            <p>
             Could it go above that resistance level? Sometimes it does, but your highest probability is the third, the rule of three. And the reason again goes back to psychology because now people are saying, ‘here’s this price level that has lasted this entire time.’ And what happens here, we gap above it, and this will be what happens sometimes when the market really wants to move. It will just gap right above that resistance level and not deal with it. So now the people that were going to take profits at it, well we’re already above. So now they’re thinking, ‘maybe I’ll stay in it because maybe this thing is going to go.’ The breakout traders who are buying will, they’re in and the people are going to go short. Well, they’re saying, ‘I don’t know, this doesn’t look good because we just get up above that resistance.’
            </p>
            <p>
             So the energy is sentiment, that dynamic of what traders are doing now is completely different. Then you’ll also get people who wait for which we call it the throwback and this is the throwback, goes up and retraces back down to that resistance level and then they’re going to be buying there. The rule of three basically means this, when the market goes to a price level ones, that sets the stage and that’s basically just planting a flag. Then number two, the second time, a little less likely because you’ve got a lot of traders who have mixed emotions about it. It’s also less likely to break through. Could depend on rumor news and gossip, all kinds of stuff, right? Economic, situation. But as far as pure technical analysis goes, and by the way you can’t, I got to be really clear about this.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Breakout Strategy Forex
            </h2>
            <p>
             This is really important. You can’t just depend on support, resistance and the rule of three by itself. In fact, there’s no one thing in trading. No one thing in trading that will make you profitable. What makes us profitable in trading is putting together a number of non-correlated variables and waiting for the multiple lines. Then you put this together with the other things that you used in your trading. So this would be another thing to add to your trading methodology. One more little piece of evidence if you will. So then as we break above it the third time, now, one will get above it. Again, sentiment has changed. We retrace, this is the third time that we’ve come to this price level and let’s make sure I get the right one. So that’s one, that’s two.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now the third time is the most likely it is to go. In fact, you know what led me. So now I can make this more clear. So there’s the first time it reaches that price level there. The second time. Now the third time is key. This is a real decision point in this. In this case, we said yes, it went up and we said, why? If we did not get this gap, if the market just went up here, stopped and then held resistance, came down a little bit, odds are that market is not going to continue to go up outside of the market’s going to come down, and again, it’s mass psychology where people are saying, you know what, this whole time we’ve been watching this level and no, we could not get enough buyers after three times.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Forex Trading
            </h2>
            <p>
             It’s kind of like three strikes you’re out, but it’s really just a mentality of people saying the global markets have tried to break above this price level three times and the markets have not been willing to do it, meaning the people in the institutions trading it and therefore people just aren’t going to pay more. They’re not going to pay more for that. So now it becomes a bearish situation. Everyone’s sentiment switches to bearish, so that’s the rule of three, works really good. I encourage you to look for that pattern and added to your trading methodology.

             Risk Reward Ratios are often times overlooked by most traders nowadays, and the theories underlying these ratios, in this discussion,

Traders are so caught up by established candlestick patterns, which in some instances, don’t necessarily work, unknowingly underestimating the importance of learning and understanding the fundamentals running this structured knowledge. Thus, they go out and complain that the market is against them, and the like.

            <h2>
             Risk Reward Ratio
            </h2>
            <p>
             Welcome to this video on
             <u>
              risk reward ratio
             </u>
             for forex, stock trading, day trading and well, this applies to swing trading as well for that matter. So here’s the big issue. A lot of people out there will say things like, well, I won’t take a trade unless it has a better than three to one reward to risk ratio, four to one reward to risk ratio, five to one, reward to risk ratio, whatever it might be, and that’s all great. However, I want to share with you some real-life considerations when you’re taking a stance like that. The first issue is that risk reward ratios are generally inversely correlated to win-loss ratios. If you want to have more winners than losers, you’re going to have to be willing to take some trades that don’t have as good a reward to risk ratio, and that’s a psychological issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             We’ll come back to that a little bit. So trades with the higher risk reward ratio tend to have a lower win-loss ratio. Why is that? There is a very clear reason. That’s because it’s simply easier to determine a short-term move in the market. Why is that? Well, because as more time goes by where things can happen in the market to change the market sentiment, and this is why; one of the reasons why I should say that the trades that have a better risk reward ratio, they take more time to develop and therefore they’re less likely to complete. And so when I want to say they have a worse win-loss ratio, I mean to completion. What we’re expecting it to have as a final target doesn’t mean you’d lose money necessarily if you manage your money well, but it’s less likely to complete its pattern.
            </p>
            <h2>
             What is Risk Reward Ratio
            </h2>
            <p>
             Let’s talk about a trade that has the best risk reward ratio, which is a reversal trade where you get in at the end of a trend, and then you’re looking to trade a new trend in the opposite direction. That is the single best reward to risk ratio trade there is. The average trend last five waves. So there is wave five right there. Now we would say, this is statistically the time to take a trend reversal trade and catch a trend in the opposite direction before it even confirmed and therefore get a fantastic reward to risk ratio. Definitely better than three to one, usually even better than a five to one reward to risk ratio. These are so phenomenal. So sure, we all love to risk a little bit to make a lot and that’s fantastic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here’s one of the challenges. So this particular trend went seven waves instead of five. And this is one of the challenges, it is very difficult to determine when exactly a trend will end. Five is statistically the average, but because it’s an average by definition, there’s got to be some trends that last only three waves. Now there are another seven waves and, therefore, again, you’re not going to have a good a win-loss ratio. You get stopped out here, for example, and this will turn into a losing trade. Another problem with trend reversal trades is that they’re the best reward risk ratio trade. But most trends don’t actually reverse. In other words, even if I really take this trade here and go short, odds are the market will stop trending. But it’s not typically going to immediately reverse and go into a downtrend.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Trading Risk Reward Ratio
            </h2>
            <p>
             What happens at the end of most trends is that they just kind of go sideways. There’s a cycle in the market of trending and non-trending, and what most likely will happen is that the market will go into a non-trending cycle. Then again, trading trend reversal trades. Sure, great reward to risk ratio, but only when they complete, and they do not complete most of the time. So here’s another example, again, you’ll see that we get the same thing where we get five waves and then it goes down and, that’s not it. If we would have taken this long for a trend reversal trade, it went down to meet another lower low. First of all, let me give you one solution to this when I trade trend reversal trades – yes, five waves is the average trend.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don’t want to trade within the average. When I take trend reversal trades, I actually wait for wave seven. That means that sometimes the market will stop trending after wave five, and I won’t get an opportunity to take a trend reversal trade. That’s okay. I want that market to be more extended. I want it to be beyond the average because I have actually a really good chance then that seven is going to be the final low. Now, does that then give me a guarantee that the market will go up into a new uptrend? No, but what I like to do is what I call a hybrid trade. So scalp trades, okay. What has a better win-loss ratio since these big long trend trades or trend reversal trades that have a very good reward to risk ratio traits don’t have as good of a win-loss ratio?
            </p>
            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p>
             What has a good win-loss ratio, scalp trades, but then again, conversely, scalp trades don’t have as good of a reward to risk ratio. So I do a hybrid. What I simply do is I will take some profits if I take this long, which this is a typical trend reversal trade for me. That’s a half cycle right there. And so I lock in some profits there, in other words, as a hybrid, I’m doing a little quick little scalp trade, lock in some profits, and then adjust my stop, put in a trailing stop. This way I’m golden, right at this point really can’t lose, especially if I have my position hedged and so forth. And that’s really the key. Psychologically, it’s very important for most traders, including myself – to have more winners than losers.
            </p>
            <p>
             And if I have more winners than losers, and I get some big trades in there as well, then that’s just the best of both worlds for me. So this is what I do; I’ll take a full position, I’ll take part of my position, also my profits at the half-cycle. By the way, if you’re interested, my cycle indicator to share with you how the cycles work and how we measure them mathematically with precision, feel free to send me an email at barry@topdogtrading.com. I also make Webinars, pretty much every week, sometimes twice a week where I actually give away my cycle indicator for free and give you a 40-minute tutorial on how to trade it and that’s how we determine where these numbers go. You see the notations of the numbers and the ABCs and so forth.

            </h2>
            <p>
             That’s all done with my cycle indicator. Happy to give that to you for free. Anyway, we trade a half-cycle, we lock in some money because that half cycle is a super high win-loss ratio. Rarely do I get a loss on that. Then I moved my stop and now, I’m golden. Wouldn’t that be great to be golden on every single trade? And again, then our win-loss ratio. It was through the roof and even if it’s small, a bunch of small little winners at the end of the day or the end of the week is, it adds up. And then not only that, but you ended up then getting some big wins as well. Now let’s take that off and let’s see what happens here because I want to share with you another problem when people say, I will only take these big win-loss ratio trades.
            </p>
            <p>
             Okay, we’re going, and then we’re good. It’ll fit in the chart. So this one worked right? This trend reversal trade worked and indeed our risk is tiny. This is literally the risk on the trade and our reward is huge. That’s somewhere there; probably right in about, there would be our reward. So, reward to risk ratio. Fabulous, we love it. We’d like to have these every day of the week or every hour of the day. The problem here though, if you look at this, is that the longer the trend continues, in this case, trend reversal trade. But the longer the market moves, the more fluctuations come in on their journey to the top. Psychologically, this would be a bit challenging from here to here and not a big deal from there to there.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Risk Reward Ratio Forex
            </h2>
            <p>
             Not a big deal from here all the way down to here. Here’s the question, could you stay in when it broke this low, for example. Would you still stay in? And this is very typical of long-term moves. They get these big fluctuations from the time you get in over here to the target over here and it becomes psychologically challenging to hang in there for the whole movement because you see your P &amp; L, you’re given the money back, we’ll give you money back, give him any back.
            </p>
            <p>
             These are things that you need to consider, and some of them are personal decisions as to your own trading psychology, what you’re comfortable with and so forth. So the bottom line is I’ll end with this. A lot of it is personal. You need to decide what works for your brain cells, so understand too that scalp trades occur more frequently. That gives you more trades every day or every week if you’re a swing trader, and they give you satisfaction. They help you with the problem of getting bored. If you’re only going to take trades that have a very high reward to risk ratio, you’re going to get bored and you’re going to get antsy. And when traders get bored and antsy, they tend to make mistakes and it’s not as satisfying.

             Now, if you’re a really patient person and you can do that, that’s fantastic. Then that might be the way to go for you. If you find yourself needing more trades and getting reckless because you’re not getting enough trades, you might want to incorporate a scalping trading into your trading as well. Pick up some of those quick profits along the way, waiting for the big moves. And to me, again, that combination is really the best.

             in every trade is a great way to better anticipate market movement. With the availability and use of a vast selection of indicators, there really is no way for a trader to say his/her loss is due to lack of resources; it all falls on their approach to trading; in essence, their psychology, trading strategy, etc.

             Indicators are, ultimately, a valuable asset for traders. They’re never wrong in providing supplemental data for traders to help them in every aspect of their trading framework. However, most traders nowadays have fallen under the false assumption that these indicators make them money! In fact, they seem to be so caught up with this idea that most, if not all, blame their losses in indicators.

            <h2>
             Technical Analysis Tutorial
            </h2>
            <p>
             Welcome, my friend to this
             <u>
              technical analysis
             </u>
             tutorial with the very controversial title of ‘indicators are never wrong’. That is a strong statement. In technical analysis, indicators are never wrong, let’s just be very literal about what indicators are, they are mathematical formulas. They’re not magical, but they are mathematical. What happens when we talk about this in most traders mind? Well, they start to think of people who say ‘I don’t trade with any indicators, I don’t need any stinking indicators because they are all lagging’, things like that. And let’s deep dive into that a little bit.
            </p>
            <p>
             There’s a lot of truth to that, but it isn’t the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. When we talk about indicators being lagging, it is an issue of yes, I acknowledge what people are saying that in the sense that the market, in this case, whatever market we’re looking at the stock market today, by the way, no particular reason that I’m looking at the stock market, but whether it’s futures, Forex, etc., you’ve got people who say ‘I just look at price bars’.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think of price bars, are they leading? Know that the price bar there is also lagging, and so is every other price bar on the chart in the sense that it’s already posted data. The data is done, the buying and the selling are done when that bar is closed and, therefore, after that bar is closed, it’s not telling you anything about the future necessarily.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Stock Market Technical Analysis Tutorial
            </h2>
            <p>
             Now, some people might disagree with that, with price patterns and so forth. And, perhaps, we’ll get into that in a future video because then you get into the whole issue of our price patterns leading, and there’s been a lot of studies done on that. But, today, we want to just focus on the issue that price bar is just as lagging as an indicator is and the sense of here we have MFI, as you can see, it’s just taking the data from whatever market you’re trading relative to whatever time interval you’re trading. It is taking that data, putting it into the left side of a math equation, and then that indicator’s equation crunches the numbers and spits out a value out the right side. That’s the value at this snapshot in time.
            </p>
            <p>
             So really the indicator isn’t leading or lagging price, it’s giving you the same or it’s giving you the information at the exact same time which is in real time. So that is the first thing to say. Now, why do I say indicators are never wrong? Because math is never wrong. Math is just it, it is always what it is. So you can’t really say that indicators are wrong. I find that people get sloppy about their language because they imply things from that language and then they use that language in their self-talk. Then it messes them up psychologically when they come to trading because they’re not being accurate enough in their understandings and definitions of things. Therefore, what we need to be looking at here is the fact that indicators by themselves, price bars by themselves, nothing by itself makes us money.

            <p>
             So normally when people say ‘indicators are wrong’, they’re talking in the context of making money, right? So that’s going beyond the next step of what I’m talking about here, which is just being very literal. Now, to make money in the market, we cannot rely on any one thing. There are no certainties in the market. There’s no one magic holy grail indicator. There’s no one magic holy grail, candlestick pattern or multi-buyer pattern. We’re moving average or anything like that. The way that I make money in the market is by putting together five non-correlated variables and when they all agree, they’re all bullish or bearish, because they’re non-correlated. It gives me a probability scenario. Still does not give me a certainty; there is no certainty and trading. In fact, I don’t even like calling trading, trading. I’m a little old-fashioned.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m born in 1959. So back in the days of Yore, we didn’t have computers. We had a black and white TV. I’m an oldster and back then, back to the days of Jesse Livermore, thinking about that, if you’ve ever read the classic books about him and so forth, they called it speculation back in those days. I actually like that term better because that’s really what we’re doing. And again, the self-talk, if I call it speculation, then it reminds me, it keeps it in the forefront of my mind that what I’m doing is risky and that what we’re doing is managing risk and there no certainties. Still, call me old fashioned fine, but I think it helps me psychologically actually. I know it helps me psychologically and that’s up to you whether you want to adopt that term, that ancient term or not.

            <p>
             So, getting back to how can these things be helpful in actually making money, since there’s no one thing, what I look for are five energies in the market and I’m looking for them at the moment of taking the trade. Those five energies are numbered and I treated them where I look at them in this order. Number one is the trend, the direction of the market; not only the direction but am I early in a new trend?
            </p>
            <p>
             That’s a good place to start, tells you, which side of the market you want to be on. Also, the trend is your friend until the end, so we don’t want to trade a trend late. We want to trade it early, so timing and the trend are critical. Number two is momentum. That determines what the strength of that trend is. Is it a strong trend or a weak trend, do I have to trade in the direction of the trend or not?
            </p>
            <h2>
             Learn Technical Analysis of Stocks
            </h2>
            <p>
             Because there are weak trends and a weak trend, even if you trade in the direction of it, you will get stopped out. Number three are cycles, and that’s about timing your entry – when to get in and out, when you’re going to get a final swing, high or final swing low, so that after you get in, you don’t get stopped out.
            </p>
            <p>
             By the way, I do have an amazing timing indicator that I actually give away for free on a Webinar that I offer absolutely free. Feel free to send me an email at barry@topdogtrading.com to get access to that and it works on any trading platform, any market. And that’s a Freebie that I gave out. I’ll give you a free tutorial with it as well. Those are the first three energies: trend, momentum, support and resistance levels. And number five is then the fractal energy where I’m looking for the dominant energy of the next higher timeframe.
            </p>
            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p>
             And that’s it, those five non-correlated energies; when they’re bullish, I go along, when they’re old bearish, I go short, and I put in hard stops. I hedge my position to manage the risk, and that’s trading in a nutshell. So let’s look at a couple of things here real quick and I’ll show you why they work sometimes, why they give us a high probability scenario. So first of all, let’s get this stuff off here and draw in a couple of new lines.
            </p>
            <p>
             First of all, for trend, as you can see here using the 50-period simple moving average, why is there any magic to it? Nope, but on a daily chart, a lot of people look at it. So, one of the reasons why certain things in technical analysis work is that it has a self-fulfilling prophecy to it. Nothing magical. It’s just purely that you got a lot of people looking at it and at times you have a lot of people looking at something, then the mass psychology kicks in and people respond to it.
            </p>
            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p>
             Especially on a daily chart, a lot of people look at a 50-period, simple moving average. You see it provides resistance here. Again, nothing magical. It’s just mass psychology. So the same principle applies to support resistance. Nothing magical about them, but if you have certain levels that everybody’s looking at 52-week highs and lows would be a good example of that, then the market’s going to respond to it in some way and you should include it as part of your trading methodology. Keep your eye and knowing that everybody’s watching that level. Okay? Again, can’t read it alone. It’s one piece of evidence now. So that’s one category of technical analysis indicators which, again, is things that a lot of people are looking at and that’s the reason that they work or at least give you a probability scenario as part of an overall method.

             RSI Technical Analysis Tutorial
            </h2>
            <p>
             The other thing that we’ll talk about today is momentum. So momentum is the second thing that I look at after trend here. We have the MFI – Money flow indicator. It’s money flow index actually, and it is a volume-weighted RSI, so it’s similar to the RSI but incorporates volume, which is what makes it actually a more literal momentum indicator. By the way, RSI is not a momentum indicator; that’s the ‘Big scandal’. Might as well throw another heresy out there. Classically, we identify it as a momentum indicator. But really it’s a rate of change indicator because it doesn’t incorporate weight. And in physics, momentum is volume times mass, so mass equates to volume in the market. So, if your indicator doesn’t incorporate volume, it technically is not a literal momentum indicator.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let’s talk about something practical here in trading. Those are again, I am a pretty literal guy, that’s why I bring those things up. If you’re going to trade something like you know, you’re looking at a downtrend here, right? And then we’re going to look for connecting these two lows and trade a breakout. Now, a great fail goes back up. What would then give us an indication that that might fail, that that breakout might fail? Just a very simple example here is the momentum is up. So, therefore, this is a weak trend. Well, momentum is moving up, therefore, I would not want to sell bearish into bullish momentum. And therefore, again, the trend is your friend until the end. We’ve already been in this trend for a little while and when you get a momentum shift now, it’s like we’re going down here a little bit.
            </p>
            <h2>

            <p>
             We break that little trend line. That’s a common trading method that a lot of people use. Not a bad method, but I wouldn’t trade the price pattern alone. I want to know is if the market moving down on strength or weakness. Here, it’s moving down on weakness. We have conflicting energies, in other words, so I’m looking for the confluence of those five energies. We don’t have it, we have the energies fighting each other. Here, the trend is down, and momentum is up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let me show you a different example of the opposite of that. Here, we now have, if we were to draw a line across these highs and use that same technique, then we would again look at momentum. In this case, the MFI and it is moving up. Therefore, as we break this trendline, we have upward momentum. 50 MA is up. It’s early, again, early in a new trend and trend being defined by getting above the 50 MA, the 50 MA angling up so we’re early in the new trend, not late in an old trend.
            </p>
            <h2>

            </h2>
            <p>
             Now the trend is our friend, but that’s just direction. We need strength behind it and in this case, momentum does confirm it so we have an alignment and therefore when it breaks the trend line, it actually follows through. That’s the type of way that we combine indicators which mathematically measure the energies, these energies of the market, the underlying energy of the auction place, if you will, to give us a probability scenario. And, obviously, we always manage our risk in the process, but by having these non-correlated energies align, it gives us a much higher probability of success because the indicators are mathematical and, therefore, they’re never literally wrong. We can use them to create a rule-based method. We’re actually measuring the flow of money by the way, bar by bar, so I’m not necessarily looking for anything to be a long-term leading indicator.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, I don’t believe anything like that does exist. Nothing magical here, but we look for this kind of stuff at the moment we enter. So at that moment, that’s what I’m interested in. In fact, if you look, we’ve even got a trend line break here, right? So it’s at the moment I enter that, I’m interested in all this stuff and that’s the only moment. And then from there, I trade bar by bar and I continue to watch the money flow, the energy of the market because the market can do anything at any time. It can change at any time. And this is why nobody can predict the long-term moves of the market. So we use our trailing stops and our targets and things like that to help us to become successful traders.

           These results are based on simulated or hypothetical performance results that have certain inherent limitations. Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record, these results do not represent actual trading. Also, because these trades have not actually been executed, these results may have under-or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated or hypothetical trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to these being shown.
