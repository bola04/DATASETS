         <h2>
          Happy Summer from Chef Andy!
         </h2>
         <p>
          Summertime is a wonderful time for casual outdoor gatherings with 
               family and friends. And as we close in on Independence Day, it's 
               an excellent occasion to show your patriotism! Chef Andy is happy 
               to present the revival of
          <a href="recipes/patrioticpie.html">
           Patriotic 
               Pie
          </a>
          .
         </p>

          <img align="left" border="0" height="150" hspace="20" src="images/patrioticpie.jpg" vspace="10" width="200"/>
         </a>
         <p>
          I first created this recipe in the summer of 2005, as a response 
               to the right-wing flag-waving surrounding the Iraq war. Any criticism 
               of the war, or to the Bush administration policies, would be screeched 
               down with chants of "Flag! Terrorists!! 9/11!!"
         </p>
         <p>
          The Iraq War has now lasted longer than the Korean War. It has 
               been obvious for years that there never were any "Weapons of 
               Mass Destruction" to threaten America, and that Saddam Hussein 
               had absolutely no connection to September 11th. But the administration 
               is attempting to hide its actions by constantly trying to keep us 
               in a state of fear.
         </p>
         <p>
          Take back the flag. Proudly fly it for the Fourth of July, and 
               feature red, white, and blue at your summer parties! Because the 
               flag belongs to all of America, not just those who support the Bush 
               Administration. And for the Fourth of July, make a point of reading 
               out loud the
          <a href="http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/declaration.html">
           Declaration 
               of Independence
          </a>
          and the
          <a href="http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/bill_of_rights.html">
           Bill 
               of Rights
          </a>
          , to remind us all of what this country really stands 
               for. That's been lost in the last four years. It's time to take 
               back America.

             <p> Chef Andy is delighted to present a huge collection of classic 
               Jell-O recipes on this site, along with an archive of classic middle 
               American comfort food dishes. You'll probably remember many of them 
               from your own childhood, and here are the original recipes ... in 
               many cases, probably direct from the same (now safely out-of-copyright) 
               cookbook that Grandma used to use! I've highlighted a few of the 
               most popular ones below, but be sure to investigate the full<a href="recipes.html"> 
               recipe archive </a>to discover some other lost delights!</p>

           Strawberry Pretzel Dessert
          </a>
          <br/>
          Like a strawberry cheesecake, but with the surprise of pretzels!

          Start this one a day in advance, because you need to make the 
                 color cubes first. But it looks delightful!

          The single most popular recipe on this site --- but I've never 
                 been able to figure out why! Maybe nobody else in the whole web 
                 knows how to make it?

         Chef Andy's Household Hint:  Jell-O prepared with tonic water glows under black
 	light, but tastes really awful.  For a better way to make your Jell-O mold
 	glow, try serving it on a glass plate with an activated cyanamid lightstick
 	underneath.  Works especially well with green food such as
