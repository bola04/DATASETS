           This web site is intended to
                     be a place of reunion, a place of memory and a place
                     of celebration of the town of Glendale and its
                     people. The pressures of modern life make it harder
                     and harder to maintain a sense of community for a
                     town. At the same time, the wonders of the Internet
                     make it possible to establish connections, share
                     stories and information in ways that were impossible
                     in days past. This web site will make it possible
                     for anyone having an interest or emotional tie to
                     Glendale to connect with others with the same
                     interests. We hope that this web site will be a
                     place to renew old friendships, discover relatives
                     who have passed on, meet new cousins, share news
                     about the community and hopefully acquire a new
                     appreciation for the special place that is Glendale.

                  An effort was underway to establish

                Iron tools and other

                               settlers. Fortunately, all of the
                               necessary parts of the iron making process
                               were available at the place that was to
                               eventually become the town of Glendale.
                               There was water power to turn a water
                               wheel and power a bellows to operate the
                               furnace. There was iron ore along the
                               banks of the creek. There was limestone
                               available for the digging and there was a
                               vast number of trees to be turned into
                               charcoal. The iron industry was to be very
                               important in the history of Glendale.

                                   Creek was not the site of the first
                                   textile mills in Spartanburg County.
                                   The Â first mills in the Upcountry
                                   were built on the waters of the Tyger
                                   River between 1816 and 1818 by two
                                   groups of new Englanders. Both of
                                   these mills burned but were rebuilt.
                                   One group ceased operation in 1826,
                                   the other group continued toÂ 
                                   operate small textile mills for many
                                   years. Â What was special about
                                   the textile mill built, at what was to
                                   become Glendale, was the size of the
                                   operation. Around 1832, Dr. James
                                   Bivings came from Lincolnton, NC to
                                   build and start what became known as
                                   the Bivingsville Cotton Factory.

             It is amazing how quickly our lives
                         have changed from a rural pattern to the one we
                         have today. The pace of technical change is so
                         fast that we sometimes have trouble keeping up
                         with it. We take things for granted in
                         communications, travel, medicine, etc. that our
                         ancestors would see almost as miracles. For the
                         most part, these changes have occurred in barely
                         one or two generations. Most children today,
                         live in a vastly different world than the one
                         their grandparents lived in at their age. Rev.
                         Crocker was born and raised on a small farm a
                         short distance away from the Glendale mill
                         village He has written a very interesting story
                         about growing up on the farm and has allowed us
                         to use it on this website.Â  His story

                Cliffside Mill in North Carolina was much
                               like Glendale. Residents have started a
                               fascinating website to tell the story of
                               their people, town and their past. The
                               site has movies taken in 1937 and 1940.
                               These movies tell an intimate story of the
                               community Â and the people as they
                               went about their lives. Although taken at
                               Cliffside, life in Glendale was very
                               similar. The web site is:
