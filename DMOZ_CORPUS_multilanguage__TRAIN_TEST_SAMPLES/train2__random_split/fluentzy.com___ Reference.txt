       As you know, Prof. Kev Nair is internationally respected as "the father of English-fluency building" and as the "father of English fluency lexicography".
      </p>
      <p>
       No other work on English fluency-building has ever been acclaimed and praised as highly and as universally as this set of 20 fluency-building books by Prof. Kev Nair (Read the

      <h3>
       Total wisdom of spoken English fluency
      </h3>
      <p>
       Prof. Kev Nair's fluent-English self-study books plant the fluency nucleus in you and help you achieve great spoken English fluency -- by doing two things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1). Fluency-building wisdom: English Fluency Jnana™. Prof. Nair's fluency-building books teach you the unique fluency-building knowledge on which true spoken English fluency is based.
      </p>
      <p>
       2). English fluency techniques: English Fluency Yoga™. They help you master the specialized techniques that will help you put the unique fluency knowledge into practice -- by speaking English only according to this knowledge. In real-life situations.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Fluentzy
       <sup>
        ®
       </sup>
       : A dedicated system of building fluency in spoken English
      </h3>
      <p>
       These 20 self-study books, as a set, are ideal for use at home as a fluency-building English course. To be done solely by self-study. Yes, by total self-study. That is, anyone who knows reasonable English can make use of Prof. Kev Nair's self-study books as a self-directed English fluency course: The Fluency Development Course™. Without help from a teacher or anyone else. Without getting any coaching or any instruction from anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       So take note of this: The fluency-building system based on Prof. Kev Nair's self-study books is not a conventional type of course of study in which you get coaching or instruction from a teacher (or anyone else) either in face-to-face sessions or through the distance-education mode. This is because Prof. Kev Nair's fluency-building system is based on the principle that nobody will be able to achieve true fluency through the coaching or instruction they get from anyone. Nobody. You achieve true fluency only when you do a course of self-directed self-study. On your own. Entirely on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       This self-directed self-study is what it really takes to achieve fluency in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is the role that Prof. Kev Nair's fluency-building books plays: They aim to make you competent enough to do this.
      </p>
      <h3>
       The problem preventing you from speaking English fluently. And the solution...
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "WHY is it that most of those who even have a master's degree in English find it difficult to express their thoughts, ideas and feelings in fluent spoken English, though they do it without much difficult in written English?
       </p>
       <p>
        "Prof. Kev Nair, an eminent scholar of international repute and a renowned English language lexicographer, goes into this question in depth and comes up with clear answers in Fluentzy, a series of twenty definitive books on the subject authored by him. These 20 self-study books, as a set, constitute a dedicated system of fluency building."

       How does Fluentzy
       <sup>
        ®
       </sup>
       help you achieve true fluency in English?
      </h3>
      <p>
       To help you achieve fluency in English, Prof. Kev Nair's fluency-building system adopts a two-pronged strategy -- a strategy that has two parts:
      </p>
      <p>
       1). It teaches you how to get rid of all the problems that prevent you from speaking English fluently.
      </p>
      <p>
       2). It teaches you how to speak English in such a way that you're able to maintain a steady fluency in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through these two methods, Prof. Kev Nair's fluency-building system teaches you how to compose your speech and speak -- at the same time. At length. In detail. Spontaneously. Without prior planning. Or advance preparation.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Conventional methods can't help you achieve true fluency in English
      </h3>
      <p>
       Mind you, conventional methods are only language-learning tools. And not fluency-building tools. No, they're not. So they're not capable of helping you master fluency strategies. This may sound incredible at first, but this is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, classroom training cannot make you truly fluent in English. • Nor written English skills. • Nor e-learning. • Nor CDs. • Nor videos. • Nor language laboratories. • Nor readymade situational-English sentences. • Nor learning done through your mother-tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Reasons: See
       <a href="fluencyfacts.asp">
        Fluency Facts
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, some of these methods can help you speak one-line English -- here and there: One-line statements. One-line questions. One-line replies. One-line instructions. But mind you, true fluency in English is something else. Something totally different.
      </p>
      <h3>
       What is fluency? What is true fluency in English?
      </h3>
      <p>
       You can’t call yourself truly fluent in English, just because you can speak one-line English here and there, can you?
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re truly fluent in English only when you can speak English continuously. At length. By giving supporting details, reasons, justifications, and illustrative examples of situations and events. Easily, clearly, confidently. Without unwanted hesitations. And by effectively managing all naturally-occurring hesitations. And by juggling with English words and word-clusters. The way articulate native-born English-speaking people do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That too, in newer &amp; newer situations. Even in situations you’ve had no training in. Spontaneously. Without prior planning. Or advance preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand this: Every real-life speech situation brings up new twists and turns -- and throws up new speech-composition problems. And fluency in English is your ability to navigate these twists and turns -- through good English. And to keep up a steady flow of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the skill of spoken English fluency is a unique skill. The only skill of its kind... And so, you can’t learn the skill of spoken English fluency in the same way as you learn other skills — computer skills, or mathematics or swimming. Fluency in spoken English needs a different approach. A completely different approach.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Secret of the fluent English-speaking professional
      </h3>
      <p>
       So here's the very first thing you should do -- to achieve true fluency in English:
      </p>
      <p>
       Acquire fluency-building knowledge &amp; skills. And whenever you speak English, speak only according to fluency-building knowledge &amp; skills. And not according to your written English knowledge &amp; skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great news is, this first step is also the last step: Master the fluency-building knowledge &amp; skills — and whenever you start speaking in English, your words and word clusters start flowing out. Readily. Easily. Instead of just remaining on the tip of your tongue.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Do what it takes: How to really tame fluency in English
      </h3>
      <p>
       There’s only one way to master true fluency in English: Do a self-directed self-study. Read Prof. Kev Nair's fluency-building books and learn from them. And do the skill-building drills and exercises they ask you to do. That is, make use of these books as though you're doing a fluency-building English course at home. With those books. By yourself, for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the only way to achieve true fluency in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       No teacher-dependent method can help. You should do independent study — outside classrooms. Yes, outside. Teach yourself. Do an English fluency course at home -- by yourself, for yourself. Without a teacher. Without anyone's help. Without even depending on the distance education mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what it takes to achieve true fluency in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prof. Kev Nair's self-study system can help you transform yourself from a person who cannot speak English fluently into a supremely fluent English-speaking professional. Far more quickly and far more easily than you think.
      </p>
      <h3>
       How to make progress in your fluency level in about 3 months
      </h3>
      <p>
       If you already have a good or reasonable proficiency in English, Prof. Kev Nair's fluent-English self-study books can help you achieve great progress in your spoken English fluency in about 3 months. And if your present level of English proficiency is poor and not good enough, you'll need more time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But spare no effort. Don't hesitate to put in hard effort. Do a fluency-building English course at home -- by yourself, for yourself. With Prof. Kev Nair's Fluency-building Encyclopedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, to achieve great fluency in English, you have to do what it really takes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know that the path that Prof. Kev Nair's fluency-building books take you along is the right path to take towards spoken English fluency. In fact, it is the only right path. (For reasons, read the
       <a href="fluencyfacts">
        Fluency Facts
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep this in mind: Nothing that you do by following Prof. Kev Nair's fluency-building system goes waste. And every little that you do according to it adds to your spoken English fluency.
