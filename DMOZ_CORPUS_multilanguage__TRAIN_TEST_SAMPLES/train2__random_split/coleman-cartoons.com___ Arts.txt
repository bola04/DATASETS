The advancement of comics from the funny papers to comic books wasnâ€™t much of a leap. However, comic book cartoons are still a viable medium while newspapers slowly die off.

          include such popular characters as Wolverine, Spiderman and The Incredible Hulk. Now these videos have been turned into fantastic movies that feature heroes like Iron Man in the classic original and the even more exciting Iron Man II.
