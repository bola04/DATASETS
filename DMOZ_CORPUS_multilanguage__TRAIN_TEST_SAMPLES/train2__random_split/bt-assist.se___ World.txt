        <p>
         All EU vessels larger than 15 meters are obliged to have an electronic 
 logbook on board and to send their logbook information electronically. Today 
 only some of the countries in EU have managed this. We can help you finalize your project.
        </p>
        <p>
         By sending your information 
 with a modern transponder through Iridium and mobile network communications your costs for airtime will be reduced.

       The           
                  Swedish company Nautic Assist has
           for many years been involved in the implementation of new standards for catch reporting from
           fisheries and vessel tracking systems in several countries. From implementing VMS in Sweden to evaluation of and
           participation in development of electronic logbook.

      <p align="left">
       By working internationally in countries like Turkey, Indonesia etc we found 
 that countries that started early with the technical development, and sticks to systems that was 
 introduced in the previous millenium soon will be passed by the developing countries who adapts new 
 and cheaper technology available on the market today.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
       This is if they don't keep up whit the development and 
 invest in new technology when it's available. We will work both with 
 EU-countries and countries outside EU to implement better and         
              
            
            
        
               
                
       more efficient systems for the safety of vessels and for 
 surveillance in order to protect the natural resorces.
