          <li>
           better distinguish between stereotypes and real
                     behavioural phenomena;
          </li>
          <li>
           look for behaviour patterns and cause-and-effect
                     theories at a cultural level;
          </li>
          <li>
           see if and how observed cultural behaviours
                     change with time;
          </li>
          <li>
           better understand the ways in which the cultural
                     environment may influence the way individuals think,
                     and vice versa;
          </li>
          <li>
           anticipate areas of potential misunderstanding
                     between cultures
          </li>
          <li>
           and no doubt to explore many other interesting
                     phenomena (but this is a data collection,
                     ethnographic project, not a theorising ethnological
                     project...)
           <br/>
          </li>
         </ul>
         2.  Anthropologists have traditionally observed
                 people in distant societies. Unfortunately, people from
                 those societies didn't often send anthropologists to
                 study others, so major collections such as the
         <i>
          Human
                   Relations Area Files
         </i>
         at Yale University are
                 relatively poor in, for example, archives on
                 industrialised societies. Travellers are not
                 anthropologists, but they can be valuable sources of
                 information when other data sources do not exist, and
                 they have one major advantage: there are far more of
                 them.  Much old documentation has been lost, but
                 there are still enormous quantities to be found in
                 neglected books, personal letters, articles, radio and
                 TV archives, etc. It is urgent to collect these unique
                 sources of information from the past and to provide an
                 easy way of looking at the data. That is what this
                 database is intended to do.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         3.  Cultural phenomena are habitually studied
                 through observations by professionals (anthropologists),
                 and this has resulted in the collection of much valuable
                 material. But the notes of an English observer are
                 likely to be different than those of a French, African,
                 or Japanese observer. The Cultures Observations Database
                 can help get around this problem by putting the
                 observers on the same level as the observed.
         <br/>

         4.  This quote is from Gary Ferraro, Professor
                 Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of North
                 Carolina:
         <br/>
         "...
         <span style="font-style: italic;">
          what we know, or
                   think we know, about our own culture is not
                   necessarily perceived in the same way by culturally
                   different people. In other words, we may see ourselves
                   as holding a particular value or cultural trait, but
                   then describe that trait in only the most positive
                   ways. Those looking at us from the outside, however,
                   are more likely to see some of the negative
                   implications as well. Thus, if cultural anthropology
                   is to help us function more effectively in an
                   increasingly interconnected world, we will have to
                   focus on accomplishing three tasks: understanding
                   culture-specific information about other cultures;
                   understanding our own culture; and understanding how
                   culturally different people view us and our cultural
                   patterns.

          First,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                   in generating new ideas, we often begin with our own
                   folk models about human nature. Being cultural in
                   origin, such folk models necessarily capture only a
                   portion of the range of human behavior, and hence we
                   are likely to overlook important aspects of psychology
                   that are not prominent in our own culture’s portrait
                   of the mind. Moreover, if we first fail to study the
                   record of human diversity, and then later fail to test
                   our ideas cross-culturally, we run the risk of
                   tautologically confirming our culture’s folk model
                   using data obtained from participants who subscribe to
                   those same beliefs."

                   participation. Individuals in any part of the world
                   are encouraged to participate. School or college
                   classes can organise the search for travellers'
                   comments on the web, on the bookshelf at home, in
                   personal letters, the school or local library. The
                   sources for travellers' comments can be written
                   material such as letters, books, magazines, and
                   websites,but comments may also be collected first-hand
                   from travellers if simple basic rules are respected.
                   You can then transmit the results of your researches
                   to us by email at the address below and we will
                   include them in the database. The final version of the
                   database will be available to all as a flexible tool
                   for testing theories of cultural behavior.
