 workouts each week and year round.  Our workouts are perfect for
 everybody, regardless of age, experience or ability. Our core
 membership is made up of "middle-to-back of the pack" runners who run
 for fun, fitness, and often for a good cause.  We are also a USATF

      We get that question a lot, and starting from the Coaches and the Board on down, Community Running is very clear on its mission: we are here for the runners you find at the back of the pack in races.  If you can run two miles, you're
      <i>
       absolutely
      </i>
      ready to join us.  If you're not quite there yet, no problem -- just drop us a line at
      <a href="mailto:info@communityrunning.org">
       info@communityrunning.org
      </a>
      and we'll get you there.  It's common that CR is the first time people have ever done a track workout, and sometimes people need a few weeks before they can do a full workout -- for instance, our current club president took 4-6 weeks before he could do a full workout when he first showed up.

 Then, just show up!  Mondays and Wednesdays, people start showing up
 at 7pm on the ground floor of
 the <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W34">Johnson Athletic
 Center</a>, south side of the building.  Around 7:15pm, we head
 outdoors for a 1.7 mile warmup loop, so layer appropriately!
 Afterwards, we head indoors to use the indoor track.<p>
 -->
       Then, just show up!  We recommend people show up dressed to run (layer
 appropriately for weather) and bring your own water (there are no
 nearby drinking fountains).  If you need to change, there are
 bathrooms available in the nearby buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      When you show up, please introduce yourself!  Our members come and go as their schedules allow, so we may not spot a new face in the crowd.
 
 For people new to doing track workouts, we have a
      <a href="track-etiquette.shtml">

      If you're coming by T, get off at either the Kendall or Central stops
 on the Red Line.  If you're coming by car, you can park anywhere along
 Vassar St.  If you're lucky, you can get a parking spot across the
 street from the
      <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=G10">
       outdoor track

 may need to head further west to find a spot.  Parking is free after 6pm.

       Core principles
      </h3>
      While we encourage everyone to come to our workouts to get a sense of
 who we are, sometimes it helps to have things written out.  To that
 end, the Board has formulated these core principles that encapsulate
 the spirit of Community Running.  The Board uses these principles to
 help guide its decision-making when it considers proposals regarding
 activities that Community Running has not previously engaged in.
      <p>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        We are a laid back and friendly club that welcomes runners of all types.
       </li>
       <li>
        We believe in our members having equal access to and personalized attention from our coaches.
       </li>
       <li>
        We provide a supportive community and network of runners from which members can learn from and indulge in all things running.
       </li>
       <li>
        We socialize through a few, high-quality events per year.
       </li>
      </ol>
      If you have any questions or comments about our core principles, please contact us via
      <a href="mailto:info@communityrunning.org">
       info@communityrunning.org

      Community Running has
      <a href="anti-harassment-policy.shtml">
       Anti Harassment Policy

      that we take seriously.  If you have any questions about it or need to file a report, please contact a Board member.

       What kind of runners do you have?
      </h3>
      The spectrum of runners that CR attracts is very large, from people who are ramping back into running (if you can run our warmup loop of 1.6 miles, you'll be fine) to people getting into racing.
 
 Starting in 2017, CR is now encouraging its members to enter the
      <a href="http://www.usatfne.org/road/gp.html">
