           <br/>
           When one visionary man set out, on his mission to fulfill his dream of the perfect fabric for the world, his passion gave birth to an enterprise called Bombay Rayon.
           <br/>
           The man was Mr. JD Agrawal. His enthusiasm for quality fabrics inspired him to bring innovations to Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited since its inception in 1986. The company has grown at an overwhelming pace, keeping up with the needs of the customers as well as stakeholders. With its entry into retail market and the global fashion export industry, Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited (or BRFL) has become the fastest growing company in the Indian Textile Industry. The culmination of a dream, this is just the beginning of a revolution in the Indian Fashion Market.
