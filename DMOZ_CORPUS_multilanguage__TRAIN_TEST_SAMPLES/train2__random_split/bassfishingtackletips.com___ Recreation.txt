        During
 the early years of the 18th century, people used only multiplying reels, which
 slowly got transformed into bait casters at a later date. In 1951 William J Jamison
 introduced ornamented Shannon twin spinner and this got metamorphosed into the
 todays spinner baits.

        Many of
 us are not aware that President Franklin D. Roosevelt is a bass fishing enthusiast
 and he is responsible for instituting the formation of Tennessee Valley Authority
 in the year 1932. The President was also instrumental in construction of various
 dams and used such of those dams for multiplying bass fish species on a larger
 scale. And it was a wide spread belief that but for the President Roosevelt, todays
 people would not have had this much of bass fishing entertainment at all.
