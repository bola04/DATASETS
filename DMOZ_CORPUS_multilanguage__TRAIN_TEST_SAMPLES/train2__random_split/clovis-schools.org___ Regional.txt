                     It’s a busy time of year for district leadership as they prepare for the start of school.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     This week, our leadership kicked off their activities by gathering for a professional development session designed to get everybody motivated and prepared as they start the 2018-2019 school year.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The theme of the session was “Water the Bamboo, Unleashing the Potential of Teams and Individuals” a leadership concept by professional trainer Greg Bell.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     "Water the Bamboo", a metaphor created from giant timber bamboo farming practices, teaches leaders that, “success is fueled by creating unshakable motivation and persistence, developing laser-like focus to avoid distractions, and being fully committed to pursuing your goal.”
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     As you visit our campuses this year, you may notice our leadership personnel have small bamboo plants in their offices, a takeaway reminder that nurture, commitment and perseverance leads to big results.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     We are excited and honored to serve Clovis families and students in 2018-2019. See you at school!

                     This week, members of the Clovis Municipal Schools Initiative (#CMSI) team are attending a residential executive development program at the Darden School of Business on the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia. During this immersive experience the team is focusing on igniting change for both organizational structure and leadership practice.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     During the six-day program the CMSI leadership team is working together to:
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <ul>
                      • UNDERSTAND ROOT CAUSE NEEDS
                      <br/>
                      • LAUNCH ORGANIZATION CHANGE EFFORTS
                      <br/>
                      • LEARN HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS WITH IMPROVED DATA ANALYSIS
                      <br/>
                      • ESTABLISH FOCUSED EXECUTION PLANS
                      <br/>
                      • CREATE A LEARNING ORGANIZATION THAT CAN CONTINUOUSLY ADAPT TO CHANGING NEEDS.
                     </ul>
                     <br/>
                     The intent of this summer program is to encourage honest conversations and higher levels of trust between the district turnaround leadership team and principals as they cooperate to create and sustain change in targeted schools.
                     <br/>

                     An unprecedented total of 68 students received bilingual seals at the Clovis High School Graduation Ceremony on May 18!
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Of those, 67 students received the NM Bilingualism-Biliteracy State Seal in Spanish, and 1 received the Clovis Municipal Schools District Bilingual Seal in Tagalog, a language of the Philippines.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     These pictures are of few of those proud Clovis High School graduates.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Excellent job Graduates, the recognition for your hard work is well deserved!
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Bilingual seal recipients were distinguished for their accomplishment with an additional black sash with turquoise embroidery marking them as seal recipients.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     A bilingual seal indicates to others that a graduate has proven their proficiency in a language other than English, a valuable distinction as they go forward to secondary education and the work place.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The bilingual seal program builds upon the rich linguistic and cultural assets of the Clovis Municipal Schools District and communicates the mastery of two or more languages which is an important skill that is advantageous in our global society.

                     Teacher assignments for the 2018-2019 school year will be made during the summer months. Teacher assignments will be posted in Skyward Family Access and a public announcement of their availability will be made in late summer.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     In the past, next-year teacher assignments were listed on each student’s final report card, however due to the changes in staff allocation that take place between school years, teacher assignments can undergo several changes prior to the start of school.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The reliability of the information provided to families regarding teacher assignments improves by announcing those assignments closer to the start of the new school year.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>

                     Monday, 25 fifth graders from La Casita and Lockwood elementary schools were awarded a Gold Pathway to Biliteracy Seal and 11 were awarded a Silver Seal.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Congratulations to all on their hard work and dedication to learning in not just one, but two languages!
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     La Casita and Lockwood are the district's two dual language elementary campuses where students are taught in both English and Spanish with a goal of equal fluency.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     To receive a Silver Seal signifying achievement in Spanish, students must have at least 2 years in a Dual Language Program, pass the Avant STAMP Assessment with a 4 &gt;, successfully complete an Alternative Process Portfolio, a Oral/Written presentation in both languages.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     To receive a Gold Seal signifying achievement in Spanish and English, in addition to the requirements for a Silver Seal, students must demonstrate proficiency on the WIDA ACCESS or their Overall ELA tier on Istation must be Tier 1.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Through an application process, students are able to determine if they qualify for the Pathway to Biliteracy-Bilingualism:Fifth Grade Achievement in Spanish or the Pathway to Biliteracy-Bilingualism: Fifth Grade Achievement in Spanish and English.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The ultimate goal is for students to continue towards the attainment of the NM Bilingualism-Biliteracy State Seal upon graduation from high school. The award builds upon the rich linguistic and cultural assets of the District and communicates the mastery of two or more languages which is an important skill that is advantageous in our global society.

                     The Clovis Fire Department responded to a fire at Clovis Apartments, Monday, May 8, 2018 at approximately 4 p.m. Luckily none of the 46 residents was seriously hurt, although all find themselves in need of short-term shelter, and at least four families will be displaced for longer since their apartment units suffered significant damage.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     For the first night the affected residents were helped by family and friends and the management company for Clovis Apartments. Today all are receiving help through the American Red Cross for their immediate needs (help with clothing, medication, and a couple nights lodging). For the next phase, the community has come together by creating the Clovis Apartment Fire Recovery Committee to address longer-term needs. The CAFRC will focus on assisting the displaced residents with the goal of getting all back to permanent housing and replacing household items.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The CAFRC will rely on the community’s generosity to accomplish this goal.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Financial donations to help these families should be made to United Way of Eastern New Mexico c/o Clovis Apt Fire Relief PO Box 806, Clovis NM 88102. Donations can also be made online at mkt.com/uwenm.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Clothing and furniture donations can be made to Matt 25 Hope Center (also Lighthouse Mission).
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The CAFRC members include Erinn Burch-United Way of Eastern New Mexico, Sylvia Montano-Clovis Municipal Schools, Steve Reshetar-Matt 25 Hope Center, Destry Hernandez-Mental Health Resources, Sistar Yancy-Christian Believers, Sandra Darling Roberts and John Reuter-American Red Cross, Elaine Williford-ENM Baptist Disaster Response, and Dan Heerding-City of Clovis.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Clovis Mayor Lansford is spearheading the fundraising efforts for the families impacted by the fire. “I was saddened to hear of the 46 Clovis residents who have been recently displaced as a result of the fire at the Clovis Apartments on May 7th,” advised Lansford, Tuesday. “Losing your home is very unsettling and stressful. I encourage the community to rise to the occasion, to help families impacted by the fire at the Clovis Apartments get back to a stable environment. It’s a time like this when neighbors come together to help a neighbor in need and to be thankful for agencies like the UW of ENM that spearhead the rapid response of our community.”

                     <br/>
                     A 1987 Clovis High School graduate, while attending college, Armando pursued his first love; pharmacology.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     After working on several research teams, Armando worked as a Senior Clinical Research Pharmacologist at AbbVie Pharmaceutical. He was a consultant in Infectious Diseases (HCV and HIV) for 3 ½ years, dedicated to the Viekira compound.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Armando and his team ensured that FDA guidelines were followed by doctors and lawyers when dealing with this investigational drug. The team took this drug to phases two and three for FDA approval. There was a 98% success rate in human trials. It is a pivotal cure, with much work involved.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The FDA gave approval of Viekira Pak for patients around the world diagnosed with Genotype 1 Hepatitis C (HCV).
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Armando’s team later helped other pharmaceutical companies understand there was an unmet need for other HCV compounds for patients around the world infected by HCV.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Armando is now working with Bayer Pharmaceutical as a Lead Pharmacologist in the Cardiovascular Division, specifically Diabetic Kidney Disease. There is a possibility to jump-start the Heart Failure program, now dependent on grant money.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The Clovis Municipal Schools Education Foundation is proud to welcome Armando Jaurequi into the alumni Hall of Honor!
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The purpose of the Hall of Honor awards is to recognize and honor former graduates of Clovis High School whose achievements, strengths of character, and citizenship serve as models to inspire and challenge today’s students. The Hall of Honor resides at Clovis High School.

                     Clovis High School 1994 graduate Brandy (Steward) Martin was recently named Teacher of the Year by the Arkansas preschool where she teaches.

                     Born in Portales, Martin was raised in Clovis.

                     <br/>
                     Following graduation from Clovis High School, she attended Southern Arkansas University, graduating with a BSE in elementary education, an M.Ed. in educational leadership, and an M.Ed. in special education, according to a story by the Magnolia Reporter.

                     Esther Smith Van Soelen, Clovis High School Class of 1946 and first female attorney in Clovis, has been selected for a Top Cat Award (posthumously) and will be inducted into the alumni Hall of Honor!
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Esther was born in Clovis and decided at an early age, that she wanted to be a lawyer, like her father.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     She attended Cottey College, the University of Oklahoma, and received a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1951. While in law school, she became the first female editor of the law review. A life-long learner, she also received a Bachelor’s in Anthropology and a Master’s in Religion from Eastern New Mexico University.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Upon completion of her law degree, Esther returned to her hometown and began practicing law with her father.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     She was the first female attorney in Clovis and was only the 16th female attorney licensed in New Mexico, at the time.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Esther was a highly respected member of the legal community. She also taught at Clovis Community College for many years.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Esther was active in her church, where she served at the district and conference levels. She was actively involved in PEO, Ranchers Camp Meeting Association of the Southwest, the Girl Scouts, CHS Band Boosters, and ENMRSHARC.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Esther and her husband sponsored two students from Bosnia, after civil war wrecked their country. They became extended members of the Van Soelen family.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The Clovis Municipal Schools Education Foundation is proud to commemorate the life of Esther Smith Van Soelen by including her in the alumni Hall of Honor !
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The purpose of the Hall of Honor awards is to recognize and honor former graduates of Clovis High School whose achievements, strengths of character, and citizenship serve as models to inspire and challenge today’s students. The Hall of Honor resides at Clovis High School.

                     <br/>
                     Last week, parents, students and staff at Parkview Elementary came together to devise a plan for how they will work together to succeed.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Called a Title I Student/Parent/Teacher Compact, the plan is an agreement between parents and the school outlining how they will partner together to help the students at the school be successful. A living document that is reviewed and revised regularly, the compact is unique to each individual school community.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     After years of using the same compact at all our Title I schools, it was time to lead our schools through a revision, so a process was modeled for sites to use that would enable them to come up with a joint compact between students, families, and staff.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Going forward, students, parents, and teachers will sign this document every fall. Mr. Marshall and his staff have done a great job of taking the modeled process to Parkview and engaging students and families in the revision process.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Congratulations Parkview for working together to achieve your goals!

                     A 1995 graduate of Clovis High School, Derek Brewster has found his passion working as the sous chef at the Capital One Club, an elite buffet restaurant at the Texas Ranger's home, Global Life Park.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Recently featured in an article by the Eastern New Mexico News, Brewster, who was brought to Clovis by his father's Air Force career, reminisces about cooking for his friends during the later part of the decade he lived in Clovis. Now he puts that same enthusiasm into cooking for famous people.

                     Despite the arrest of an individual in reference to a school threat early Friday morning, Clovis High School received a phone call that caused additional concerns. The phone threat is under investigation and unsubstantiated at this time.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     In an abundance of caution, Clovis High School has been placed on a Level 1 Lockdown, which means all doors are locked and classes continue as normal.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     In addition, CHS administration and the Clovis Police Department are monitoring activity on school grounds.

                     Clovis Municipal Schools is seeking grant funding for the 2018 - 2019 school year from the State of New Mexico, which would expand current early education programs to allow for preschool classes at each elementary school.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     If awarded, these funds would serve 4-year-old children within the Clovis School District by providing five half days of instruction per week, split to include morning and afternoon sessions.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The District will be notified of the state's decision regarding funding by May 20, 2018, at the earliest.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Further details on enrollment criteria, processes, locations, and scheduling will be provided to the public pending award of the funds.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Clovis Municipal Schools currently serves approximately 275 preschool students, ages 3 and 4, through its early intervention programs.

                     <br/>
                     At its regular meeting on April 2, 1957, the Clovis School Board announced it had chosen to name the district’s new junior high school after then-La Casita Principal W.D. “Doc” Gattis.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     From the 1920’s through the late 1950’s – a period which notably spanned the Great Depression, World War II and Korean War eras – Gattis served as principal of La Casita Elementary at its original location of Seventh and Thornton streets.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     A Tennessee native, Doc Gattis was known for his support of area youth sports. He coached local teams for decades and after retirement from education, served as justice of the peace, probate judge and served on the school board for several years, according to news accounts of his life.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Even though area surrounding the location for the school was virtually undeveloped grassland at the time the construction project meant changes, primarily for the dirt roads leading up to the site.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Prior to construction, in October 1956, the school board and City Planning Commission made a joint decision to close the segment of 14th Street that ran through the land section where the school would be built.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     However where one road ends another begins, and in 1957, at the same meeting where the Gattis name was adopted, the board voted to open 13th Street to traffic. At that time a dirt road in front of the school’s entrance, 13th Street now runs between the front of the school and the La Casa Health Center complex, connecting Cameo and Beta streets.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Gattis, had not yet retired from the schools when his namesake junior high school was completed in 1957, and was able to see the junior high function for almost 20 years until his death in 1976.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     W.D. Gattis Junior High carried his name for 50 years, until in 2007 the Clovis Municipal Schools Board of Education voted to rename the building the “Clovis High School Freshman Academy” in light of its transition from a middle school to a campus devoted exclusively to ninth grade students.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The Gattis name, however, remained important to the community, and in September 2011, the school board decided that a new middle school would once again bear the name of W.D. Gattis.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     W.D. Gattis Middle School – situated in an area of undeveloped grassland on the outskirts of town much like its predecessor had 56 years before – opened its doors to students in August 2013.

                     Clovis Municipal Schools has been notified of individuals representing themselves as Clovis High School JROTC students to solicit funds from community members. The individuals are indicating the funds are for Easter gifts for veterans.

                     <br/>
                     If you are a community member or business owner and encounter solicitations of this type, these individuals are not raising funds on our behalf. Clovis Municipal Schools does not support door-to-door solicitations.

                     <br/>

                     Nearly a year after ground was broken at the location for the new Parkview Elementary, construction continues to move at a steady pace, on track with a completion target of early June 2018.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Work within the building, under the direction of construction contractor Bradbury Stamm, is moving through various phases. With an average of 50-60 workers at the site daily, sometimes as many as 85, there is constant activity ranging from dirt work on the grounds to finishing work inside the structure.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The kinder wing, located on the west side of the building, for instance, is receiving drywall, paint, tile and final floor polishing, while on the east side, workers are hanging sheet rock and doing other types of finishing work.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     At the end of this school year, the process of relocating the existing Parkview Elementary into its new home on east 14th Street will begin.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Over the summer, Highland Elementary will be relocated to the old Parkview Elementary building on Maple Street, and classes will be conducted there while its new building is constructed over the course of the 2018-2019 school year.
                     <br/>

                     It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the untimely death of David Shawn Hunton, a Language Arts teacher at Clovis High School.

                     Our District has provided psychologists, counselors, and extra staff to assist students and teachers as we make our way through this difficult time. Students may exhibit all levels of emotions, ranging from crying, numbness, and feelings of despair, to just wanting to be close to family and friends. All responses are normal.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     There is little we can say or do to remove the sting of pain we all feel. Our hearts and thoughts are with Mr. Hunton's family.

                     CLOVIS SCHOOLS #TBT: LOCAL WOMAN OFFERS GIFT OF LAND FOR NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN 1966

                     <br/>
                     In March of 1966, the Clovis School Board discussed an offer of land for the construction of a new elementary school. Under the initial arrangement offered, the school district would purchase two and a half acres of land from resident and widow Julia Barry Witherspoon, and in turn, she would gift an additional seven and a half to the district.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The district had been keeping an eye out for land for a new elementary since 1958, at which time the board discussed purchasing seven to eight acres at an anticipated $1,000-$2,000 each.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Eventually the board did decide on Ms. Witherspoon’s land, however it was four years later in August of 1970, and the terms of the arrangement had changed. In the end, the school district purchased five acres for a total sum of $5,000 and were given two and a half additional acres as a gift – still a great savings considering they paid less than they had anticipated 12 years prior.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     A month after the purchase and gift were finalized, the board named the new school Barry Elementary.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     A construction bid of $483,887 was accepted that December, and eight months later, in August 1971, the contractor turned the newly completed building over to the school board.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thornton Street and Llano Estacado in north Clovis, at the time Barry Elementary opened its doors to students, it was the only structure in the area, surrounded by farmland and dirt roads.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Today, 47 years later, Barry is adjacent to another school, the Los Ninos Early Intervention Center and is surrounded by residential neighborhoods and busy thoroughfares.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Serving kindergarten through fifth grade, Barry Elementary supports a student body of about 400 students residing between the northernmost edge of Curry County all the way south to Manana Boulevard

                     Clovis Municipal Schools is deeply sorrowed by news of the Wednesday evening death of one of our middle school students. The student was a 12-year-old sixth grader at Marshall Middle School.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     To assist staff and students during this difficult time, grief counselors from Clovis and Portales are being made available at Marshall Middle School.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     As this is a private family matter, which occurred after school hours, the district will not be releasing further information about the student or the circumstances surrounding the death.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Our thoughts and prayers are with the student’s family and friends during this difficult time.

                     Highland Elementary School was recently chosen as one of three schools in the US to receive a $500 prize from iStation, an e-learning company.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     To be considered for a prize drawing, schools were required to demonstrate consistency in their use of iStation "Reading with Fidelity".
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Ultimately 300 schools qualified and Highland Elementary was one of three schools selected in the prize drawing.

                     Working furiously for the past week, students at the Arts Academy at Bella Vista signed their painting Friday morning, just minutes before it was photographed for submission.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Six students at the school – one from each grade – worked as a team to create the vibrant piece of art measuring 4-feet by 2-feet. The design features symbolism from around the state such as hot air balloons, a road runner, mountains a colorful sunset and much more.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Serenity Vasquez, Jazlene Navarrete, Aariah Haughawaut, Melanie Lopez, Yoselin Maya Marrufo and Eziquiel Bamba worked under the guidance of teacher Janet Robertson, who felt very strongly the final design should come from them.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     For several of the students, it was their first experience with painting, but they practiced and worked carefully. In the end, Robertson said they invested over 16 hours in the design.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Students from the Arts Academy at Bella Vista were selected by the New Mexico Public Education Department to decorate an egg representing the state of New Mexico for the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Printed on oversized, two-dimensional eggs with a placard crediting the school, student designs will be displayed to guests entering the Easter Egg Roll event at the White House on April 2, 2018.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The White House Easter Egg Roll is a tradition begun by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878 and is said to be one of the oldest annual events in White House history. While Easter Eggs representing the states and territories of the nation have been
 included at the White House event over the years, this is the first year school students have been asked to design state eggs.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     With more than 320 students in attendance and located on the west side of Clovis, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista is an elementary school with an emphasis on fine arts infused education. A high performing school, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista was one of five in the Clovis Municipal Schools District to be rated a 2017 New Mexico "A" School by the state.

                     Tuesday, the director of the Workers' Compensation Administration announced Rachel Bayless will hold a second term as a Workers' Compensation Judge in Albuquerque.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     She was initially appointed in April 2017 when one of the state's five Workers Compensation judges retired.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     A 1995 Clovis High School graduate, Bayless went on to earn a Bachelor of Business Administration from Eastern New Mexico University in 2001, and a Juris Doctorate from the University of New Mexico School of Law in 2005.
                     <br/>

                     <br/>
                     In mid-February, information about the construction of Marshall Middle School was added to an online database created by The Living New Deal.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Built 82 years ago in 1936, Marshall was constructed with grant funds provided by the Public Works Administration, operating under the New Deal.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     According to The Living New Deal, it cost $123,102 to build Marshall, $55,271 of which was paid for with grant funds.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Construction was started and completed within one year.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Responding to the Great Depression, the New Deal was a program created by Franklin D. Roosevelt in an effort to stimulate the economy and put people to work to combat joblessness.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     A non-profit organization hosted by the geography department of the University of California, Berkley, the Living New Deal's goal is to document the New Deal legacy, "Because New Deal public works were rarely marked, the era’s contribution to American life goes largely unseen and unappreciated.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     It seems inconceivable that no national register exists of what the New Deal built; yet there is none. Now the Living New Deal is rectifying that oversight – for historians but especially for the American people."

                     Students from the Arts Academy at Bella Vista have been selected to decorate an egg representing the state of New Mexico for the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The Arts Academy at Bella Vista was selected by a committee from the New Mexico Public Education Department, chosen from a pool of 89 school districts and charters in the state.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     As soon as news of the honor was received, students and staff began working immediately to produce a design that will showcase the unique character and personality of the state of New Mexico. "My teachers and students are excited and we already have a dynamic team working on the egg design," said school Principal Shelly Norris.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Printed on oversized, two-dimensional eggs with a placard crediting the school, student designs will be displayed to guests entering the Easter Egg Roll event at the White House on April 2, 2018.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The White House Easter Egg Roll is a tradition begun by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878 and is said to be one of the oldest annual events in White House history.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     While Easter Eggs representing the states and territories of the nation have been included at the White House event over the years, this is the first year school students have been asked to design state eggs.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     “President Donald J. Trump and the First Lady are honored to continue the traditions of the past while weaving new traditions into the fabric of our Nation,” the invitation stated.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     With more than 320 students in attendance and located on the west side of Clovis, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista is an elementary school with an emphasis on fine arts infused education. A high performing school, the Arts Academy at Bella Vista was one of five in the Clovis Municipal School District to be rated a 2017 New Mexico "A" School by the state.

                     Don't be surprised if you see students lobbing white cubes at their classmates next time you walk through a school in the district.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     After attending a January Professional Development program on classroom management and student engagement, teachers expressed an interest in having some of the materials that were presented by Kagan Publishing &amp; Professional Development.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The district was able to use a credit with the company to purchase about $1,300 in classroom materials designed to get students up and moving while learning and reinforcing lesson concepts.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Marked with question prompts on the front and back, "Learning Chips" are used to get kids talking about concepts and to review things that have been covered in class.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Similar but a whole lot more active, color-coded foam cubes called "Lesson Launchers" can be tossed around the room as a fun way to reinforce lessons.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     During the training, about 100 teachers from K-12th grade classrooms around the district learned how to apply the Kagan concepts with their students.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Teachers left the training excited to put those lesson tools to work in their classrooms and the district is happy to be able to provide them supplemental materials to help them do just that!
                     <br/>

                     Thursday, staff and students at Cameo Elementary celebrated Read Across America by dressing as characters from Dr. Seuss books.

                     <br/>
                     Even Principal Michael Read got into the event, coming to school dressed as the Grinch for the day.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Officially celebrated on March 2, Read Across America Day is a special day to celebrate reading and coincides with the birthday of Dr. Seuss.

                     Thursday, the halls of Sandia Elementary were filled with doctors, police officers, farmers, football players and even a scuba diver. Among the array of professionals, a principal and coach wouldn't have seemed out of place, were it not for the fact they haven't finished elementary school yet.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Sandia students were told to come to school dressed as the person they want to be when they grow up, in keeping with the theme of the Dr. Seuss book "Oh the places you'll go".
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Kindergarten student Leonardo Dominguez came to school dressed as Sandia Principal Dr. Vetterly, and even got to act the part by giving the morning announcements with Dr. Vetterly.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Coach Michael was also surprised by Emylee Vetterly, who came to school as her doppelganger for the event.

                     Clovis Municipal Schools does not endorse or support solicitations by non-school third parties.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Do not give money to anyone for school use unless you are confident that (s)he is either an employee or student of the District and is authorized to solicit funds.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Local businesses are usually the first to be targeted for solicitation from third-party agencies or organizations stating they are raising funds on behalf of the students and/or staff of Clovis Municipal Schools.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     If you are a business owner and encounter solicitations of this type, the agency or organization is not raising funds on our behalf.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     When funding solicitation is necessary for district clubs, organizations, athletic programs, advertising events, or individual schools, the requests will come directly from an employee or student of the district.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     If you believe someone is inappropriately soliciting money on behalf of Clovis Municipal Schools, please contact the Superintendent's Office at 575-769-4320.

                     In collaboration with the University of Virginia, Partnership for Leaders in
 Education (UVA-PLE), Clovis Municipal Schools has chosen Marshall, Yucca, and WD
 Gattis Middle Schools, as focus sites.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The collaborative project has been named, "Clovis Middle School Initiative (#CMSI)."
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Throughout the next two years, Clovis Municipal Schools’ Executive Director of
 Instruction Mitzi Estes, will serve as the program Shepherd and will work closely
 with the schools. The focus will be leadership development, data driven instruction,
 and 90-Day Plans with the goal of increased student achievement.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     According to UVA'S website, "Partnership for Leaders in Education (PLE) is a joint
 venture of the University of Virginia Darden School of Business and the Curry School
 of Education.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Established in 2003, the PLE was formed in order to combine the most innovative
 thinking in business and education to better serve our nation's children by
 empowering education leaders to meet the demands of operating schools and
 school systems. Believing in the critical importance of effective school system
 leadership, the PLE designs and delivers programs, including the University of
 Virginia School Turnaround Program, to strengthen leadership practice and
 establish proof points of excellence."
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Clovis Municipal Schools is excited for the opportunity to begin a partnership with
 the University of Virginia and is committed to pursuing the changes our students
 deserve.

                     Rhiannon Holmes, a 2013 graduate of Clovis High School was recently named one of three students to help maintain ASU's 21-year perfect pass rate on the Texas Examination of Educator Standards (TExES), a secondary mathematics certification test.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The test is difficult with only 61 percent passing on the first attempt, according to a story from KLST-TV, and the average score for the three ASU students was 277 out of 300, well above the state average score of 242.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Rhiannon has a track record of academic success. As a Clovis High School senior, Rhiannon was recognized for maintaining a 4.0 GPA through all four years of high school.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Way to go Rhiannon, keep up the great work!

                     In the days before the end of holiday break, teachers with Clovis Municipal Schools attended training sessions for professional development. In her weekly column, Cindy Kleyn-Kennedy writes about one of these training sessions, "Capturing kid's hearts", which marks the start of a new program being implemented at the middle school level.

                     <br/>
                     The program’s proven track record has been shown to improve student performance and attendance; reduce discipline referrals; increase graduation rates; and improve teacher retention.

                     U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. recently nominated three CHS seniors to attend service academies beginning in 2018. The students were among a group of 50 New Mexico high school seniors nominated this year.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The Clovis High School students are:
                     <br/>
                     <ul>
                      Cameron Kuykendall - West Point
                      <br/>
                      Corde Mailman - U.S. Air Force Academy
                      <br/>
                      Megan Edwards - U.S. Merchant Marine Academy
                     </ul>
                     <br/>
                     Clovis Municipal Schools is proud to congratulate all three on their prestigious accomplishment!
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Udall said in a statement, "I am excited to congratulate the 50 New Mexico students I have nominated to the United States service academies this year. These students represent New Mexico's best and brightest, and I wish them luck as they continue with the admissions process.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     These exceptional students have demonstrated strong leadership in both their academic and extracurricular endeavors, as well as a commitment to serve — a true testament to their character and motivation. I have no doubt these students will represent New Mexico well as they continue their education and pursue a life of leadership and service.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     A congressional, vice-presidential, or service-connected nomination is required for admission to the U.S. Military Academy (West Point), the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Students who received my nomination completed a competitive application process, which included an interview with the military and community leaders who comprise my Military Academy Service Panels. The nominees will compete for admission to their service academy over the coming months, and those admitted will begin classes in the summer of 2018 as members of the class of 2022."

                     Not only do they put care and pride into feeding students at 17 schools every day, Kleyn-Kennedy learned they also have a 20-or-so year tradition of baking 1,000 Christmas cookies for a local mission to distribute during holiday meals and events.

                     Cindy Kleyn-Kennedy recently participated in a "Walking Classroom" with 5th graders at the Arts Academy at Bella Vista.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Students welcomed her and showed her the ropes, "...Another confident young 5th grader sitting at a desk adjacent to mine, Angel Concha, leaned over and explained that I just needed to follow him," she recalls.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     For Kleyn-Kennedy, the experience turned out to be much more than a power-walk.

                    Exploring the music programs at Clovis Municipal Schools in her most recent article, Cindy Kleyn-Kennedy talks with program director Brandon Boerio about the district's music successes this year and outlook on the future.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Boerio's philosophy is simple, “What I’ve discovered in education is that all kids need attention, and that need manifests itself in different ways, from problem behaviors to the other end of the spectrum. All students, however, are drawn to feeling successful. When they feel successful, that’s when they have real buy-in, and this applies to all kids everywhere, regardless of demographics. They know when they’re successful.”

                     1961 Clovis High School graduate Dr. Alvy Ray (Jerry) Smith is the co-founder of Pixar Films and winner of two Academy Awards.

                     <br/>
                     Considered one of the creators of the Alpha Chanel, a pixel rendering technique that revolutionized modern animation, Smith recently spoke at New Mexico State University.

                     <br/>
                     Read his inspiring words on how it's within reach to find fame and success even for those growing up in a small town, something he never could have imagined as a Clovis youth in the 1960's.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Earning a place in the Clovis Municipal Schools Education Foundation's inaugural 2010 Hall of Honor, Smith's successes have long been a source of pride for the community.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>

                     2014 Clovis High School graduate Sabrina Romero is described by those who worked with her during high school as a real go-getter that has worked hard to overcome anything and everything that stood between her and her dreams.

                     <br/>
                     For the first two weekends in December, 90 of our kindergarten-12th grade teachers attended training courses.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Called "ELevate Your EL Instruction" (with EL being an abbreviation for English Learner), the course not only addresses meeting the needs of those students experiencing English for the first time, it also teaches teachers about the language acquisition process that all students experience.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Approximately 10 percent of the student population in Clovis Municipal Schools are classified English Learners , with such languages represented as Chinese, Japanese, Native languages, Spanish, Tagalog and Vietnamese.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     However every student, whether English is their first language or not, spends their education years acquiring language at different levels.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Exploring the importance of language and culture and learning the process of how students acquire language is critical for teachers, and this knowledge enriches the effectiveness of instruction for all students.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Hats off to our CMS teachers and thank you for the extra time you invest in our students!

                     True for any age/grade level, follow this process when using flashcards to study:
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     1. Only give your student fifteen study cards/flashcards at a time.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     2. Eight cards should consist of new information and seven cards should consist of previous terms or math facts students have learned.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     3. As students read through the cards, if they do not answer it correctly the student immediately says the term and the answer 3 times in a row while looking at the card.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     4. Then place that card two cards back (not to the back of the stack) so they will see it again quickly. If students answer the card correctly, they can remove the card from the stack.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     5. Continue until all cards are removed and have students try them again at a later time.
                     <br/>

                     Due to community need and in preparation for the upcoming flu season, the New Mexico Department of Health’s Clovis Public Health Office will be hosting another free flu vaccine clinic for children. The clinic will take place on Saturday to allow opportunity to those unable to participate in previous clinics.
                     <br/>
                     <ul>
                      WHO: School children ages 4-18
                      <br/>
                      WHEN: 9 a.m.- 2 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 9
                      <br/>
                      WHERE: 1216 Cameo, Clovis, NM
                      <br/>
                     </ul>
                     Flu vaccines will be administered free of charge, but we ask that you please bring insurance and/or Medicaid information in order for the Health Office to complete it's paperwork.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     The severity of the influenza virus can vary from year to year, but seasonal flu vaccines protect against the influenza viruses expected to be most common during the upcoming season. Nothing can protect you from the flu better than getting vaccinated every year.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Just a reminder, Clovis Municipal Schools will NOT be administering flu vaccines to students at school this year.

                     Due to community need and in preparation for the upcoming flu season, the New Mexico Department of Health’s Clovis Public Health Office will be hosting a third free flu vaccine clinic for children.

                     Flu vaccines will be administered free of charge, but we ask that you please bring insurance and/or Medicaid information in order for the Health Office to complete it's paperwork.

                     <br/>
                     The severity of the influenza virus can vary from year to year, but seasonal flu vaccines protect against the influenza viruses expected to be most common during the upcoming season. Nothing can protect you from the flu better than getting vaccinated every year.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Just a reminder, Clovis Municipal Schools will NOT be administering flu vaccines to students at school this year.

                     The severity of the influenza virus can vary from year to year, but seasonal flu vaccines protect against the influenza viruses expected to be most common during the upcoming season. Nothing can protect you from the flu better than getting vaccinated every year.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Just a reminder, Clovis Municipal Schools will NOT be administering flu vaccines to students at school this year.

                     On October 23 - 29, Clovis FFA members participated in the National FFA
 Parliamentary Procedure Contest and Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana where the team received silver rating and ranked in the top 20 in the nation.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Competing Parliamentary Procedure team members included Jack Palla, Tanner
 Duncan, Anthony Sharer, Aaron Reid, Casity Flowers, Hailey Perkins, Marie Albin, Catherine Hisel, and Deanne Guthrie. Of note is team member Anthony Sharer who scored high enough to be certified as an accredited parliamentarian.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     Upon completion of the contest, members are able to use, demonstrate, present, evaluate, and utilize parliamentary procedures and resources.
                     <br/>
