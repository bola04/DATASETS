             Spiritual Grief Support
            </h2>
            <p align="left">
             From many experiences I have found that we cannot 
                     seem to begin the healing process unless we can put our passed-over 
                     loved ones somewhere, so that there is some closure. We need 
                     to know that they are still existing around us and that they 
                     are OK, then we can begin to move on and heal in our lives. 
                     This type of spiritual healing or alternative healing work, 
                     in conjunction with conventional grief support, can make the 
                     path to recovery a little easier. The sessions are not just 
                     a psychic reading, but rather a holistic and spiritual approach 
                     to retrieving very detailed and comforting information that 
                     can only bring peace and answers to the parties involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             It 
                     is the eternal loving souls and God who send us little packages 
                     of relief from the afterlife. It has become such a passion 
                     for me to enable them to communicate with their loved ones, 
                     because it brings hope and a new way to understand the process 
                     of moving on to the other side. To be sure of accurate communication 
                     – I cannot know anything about the people involved.
