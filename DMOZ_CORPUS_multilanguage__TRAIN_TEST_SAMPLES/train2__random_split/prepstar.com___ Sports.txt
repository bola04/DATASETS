     <strong>

      CSA-PrepStar -- the Nation's #1 Athletic Recruiting Service
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If the recruiting process for college athletic scholarships wasn't confusing enough already, now athletes and their parents have to navigate through a bevy of companies that claim to be the best recruiting service of it s kind.  Unfortunately, most companies are nothing more than database aggregators that compile as many names and athletes as they can and then sell their information to corporate sponsors.  Other companies operate as boiler room hard sell closers who pressure families into buying a service that will never benefit them with their future college goals.  Many of these companies claim to work with tens of thousands and even millions of student-athletes each year.  These types of services will never provide the individual attention and service you need to really be considered as an athletic scholarship prospect for the next level.  CSA-PrepStar works with no more than 350 athletes per sport per year.  Our Elite PrepStar 350 is comprised of qualified, verified college-bound student-athletes who can play and compete on the next level both athletically and academically.  Our company enjoys a 98% success level in placing athletes with athletic scholarships because we only work with and represent legitimate college-bound prospects!
