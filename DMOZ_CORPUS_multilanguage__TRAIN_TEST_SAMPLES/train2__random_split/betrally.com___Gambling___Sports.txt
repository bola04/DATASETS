Any withdrawals from your Casino Cash Account can only be made by first transferring your withdrawal amount to your Sports Cash Account and then requesting the withdrawal be processed from the Sports Cash Account. Please note however that any transfer of funds from the Casino Cash Account to the Sports Cash Account will be considered a Withdrawal from the Casino Cash Account and may consequently result in the forfeiture or voidance of Casino product bonuses and promotions.

As outlined in section 5.4, if a financial account and/or credit/debit card has been used to deposit funds, the name registered on the Customer account held with Betrally must correspond to the name registered on the financial account/card. In the case of a request to pay funds via Direct Bank Transfer, the acquiring bank account must be held in the same name as used during registration of the Customer account. Betrally reserves the right to require the use of the same payment method for withdrawal as was used to deposit, or a specific payment method at our own discretion.

                     <p>
                      Please note that withdrawals may experience a slight delay due to our identity verification process and certain deposit methods will require additional verification at time of Withdrawal. In the case of a withdrawal being made for the first time, a large withdrawal or changes being made to payment options, we may take additional security measures to ensure that you are the rightful recipient of the funds.

Any capitalized terms used herein which are not defined shall take their meaning from the Terms &amp; Conditions.

                     <li>
                      These Betting Rules apply to Betrally’s “Sports”, “Live Betting” and “Virtuals” products.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      The minimum amount for a bet on “Sports” or “Virtuals” is €0.10 (or currency equivalent). The minimum amount for a bet on “Live Betting” is €1.00 (or currency equivalent). Your maximum amount for a bet differs between sports, leagues and bets. You will see the exact value specified in the field where you enter the stake amount, when placing a bet. We make no guarantee that any bet placed within or for the maximum stake shall be accepted.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Betrally accepts bets made online. Bets are not accepted in any other form (email, telephone, fax, etc.) and if received will be void, win or lose.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Betrally reserves the right to refuse/cancel any bet or part of a bet before the game starts and to make ambiguous bets void, without providing any justification.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Customers cannot cancel or change a bet once the bet has been placed and confirmed.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Bets will be accepted up to the advertised start time. If a bet is inadvertently accepted which includes an event after its start time, unless it is a live-betting event, the match/bet will be treated as a non-runner.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      We also reserve the right to correct obvious errors with the input of betting odds. In such cases we could apply revised odds for final settlement on pre-live betting.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Irrespective of which betting odds format you select for odds to be shown in your Customer account, all bets will be settled based on American odds.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Where we have reason to believe that a bet is placed after the outcome of an event is known or after the selected participant or team has gained a material advantage (e.g. a score, sending off etc.) we reserve the right to void the bet, win or lose.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Betrally reserves the right to cancel any bets from customers who place money on an event where they are in any way involved, as participants, referee, coach etc.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Betrally reserves the right to withhold payment and to declare bets on an event void if we have evidence that the following has occurred: (i) the integrity of the event has been called into question or (ii) matchrigging has taken place. Evidence may be based on the size, volumes or pattern of bets placed with Betrally across any or all of our betting channels.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      When an event is cancelled, all related bets will be void automatically and accounts refunded.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      If any match is abandoned due to injury, bad weather, crowd trouble etc. all bets that have already been settled up until the time of abandonment will stand. For example: If a football match is abandoned in the second half, all bets involving the 1st half will stand. What’s more, if there has been a goal scored, the first goal scorer market will stand, but the last and any time goal scorer bets will be void. For tennis: if a player retires injured in the 3rd set, all bets to win the 1st and 2nd sets will stand.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Betrally does not accept any responsibility for typing, human or palpable errors, which lead to obvious price errors. In such cases all bets will be deemed void.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Multiple bets that combine different selections within the same event are not accepted where the outcome of one affects or is affected by the other. If such a bet is taken in error, the bet will be cancelled.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Betrally offers you the ability to bet in-play on a variety of global sporting events and while we do make every effort to ensure all live betting information is accurate, there may be situations where such information is incorrect, due to delays or otherwise. When checking live betting odds, live event start times or any other live event markets, please be aware that such information is provided as a guide only and we accept no liability for the outcome of any inaccuracies which may occur. It is the sole responsibility of the customer to check such information is accurate at the time of publication.

                     <li>
                      The official result is final for settlement purposes except where specific rules state the contrary. The podium position in Grand Prix racing, the medal ceremony in athletics and any similar official ceremony or presentation in other sports are to be treated as the official result.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Winnings will be credited to the Customer’s account following confirmation of the final result.

                     <li>
                      Betrally reserves the right to void any bet that may have been accepted when the account did not have sufficient funds to cover the bet. If an account has insufficient funds as a result of a deposit that has been cancelled by the payment processing party, Betrally reserves the right to cancel any bet that may have been accepted retroactively.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      The maximum total winnings which may be accrued by a given Customer on any day (any 24 hr period) across all products offered by Betrally is €50,000.00 or currency equivalent (hereafter the “Maximum Daily Payout”).
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      The maximum Withdrawal amount for any given month (any 30 day period) is €20,000.00 or currency equivalent.

                       <li>
                        A number of bets may be treated as being one when a Customer places multiple copies of the same bet. When this occurs all bets may be voided apart from the first bet struck. A number of bets that contain the same single selection may be treated as being one. When this occurs all bets may be voided apart from the first bet struck. An example would be where 1 particular selection is repeatedly included in multiple bets involving other short-priced selections.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        Where there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same (or very similar) selection(s) having been placed by or for the same individual or syndicate or individuals, Betrally reserves the right to make bets void and suspend relevant accounts. This rule applies to both settled and unsettled bets.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        If you have played in a professional capacity, or in tandem with other Customer(s) as part of a club, group, etc., or placed bets or wagers in a coordinated manner with other Customer(s) involving the same (or materially the same) selections; in this instance we further reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to restrict the total maximum pay out for the combined total of any such bets, to the equivalent of the Maximum Daily Payout limit permitted for a single Customer (as outlined at section 22 above). Betrally is for sole use on an individual basis and for personal entertainment only.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        Betrally allows only one account per person. Any subsequent accounts opened under the same postcode/personal details/IP address that are found to be related to any existing account may be closed immediately and any bets will be voided at Betrally's discretion. Betrally reserves the right to reclaim any winnings attained by these means and we reserve the right to withhold all or part of your balance and/or recover from your account deposits, pay outs, bonuses, any winnings that are attained by these means.

                       The length of a game of Australian Football can vary from league to league, but is generally around 15 to 25 minutes per quarter. In the AFL, each quarter runs for 20 minutes plus time on – which makes up for time occupied in stoppages, such as when the ball going out of bounds, injuries, goals (or behinds) being kicked, or when the umpire is setting the angle of a free kick on goal. Time is kept by two off-field officials, known as "timekeepers", who sound the siren at the start and end of each quarter. A typical AFL quarter might run from 27 to 33 minutes, but may be even longer if, for instance, injuries cause delays. AFL breaks after the first and third quarters are six minutes, with a 20-minute break at halftime.[5] Thus, a match with quarters averaging 30 minutes would last about two and a half hours.

                      An exception is made when this rule relates to friendly matches. In such cases, all match markets are settled based on the actual result at the end of the game (excluding any extra time), irrespective of whether the full 90 minutes is played.

                      Some Soccer matches may have different playing schedules. In that case the following will apply:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      90 minutes scheduled play (3 x 30 minutes). Full-time bets are still considered valid. Half-time bets are considered void.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      80 minutes scheduled play (2 x 40 minutes). All bets are still considered valid.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Should any match be played prior to the date or kick-off time denoted then bets will stand provided the wager is placed not later than the revised kick-off time.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      All bets on a match abandoned before the completion of the regular time will be void unless the match is rearranged and played on the same date (local time) or stated otherwise in the rules, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If the game does not take place as scheduled and is not played on the same date (local time) all bets are void. An exception is made if incorrect kick-off time is announced on our website.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If a match venue is changed then bets already placed will stand providing the home team is still designated as such. If the home and away team for a listed match are reversed then bets based on the original listing will be void.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Bets will stand if we list a team name without specifying the term 'XI' in the name.

                      In the absence of an official source, or when significant conflicting evidence is present, bets will be settled based on our own statistics.

                      All games must start on the scheduled date (local time) for bets to have action. An exception is made if incorrect kick-off time is announced on our website. If a match venue is changed, bets will stand as long as home team is designated as such. If the home and away team for a listed match are reversed, then bets based on the original listing will be void.

                       In all cases, all selections must be successful to be a winner. If one or more selections from the accumulator are cancelled, the bet stands as soon as at least one of the remaining selections is settled as a winner or loser.

                       A non-runner is a selection that is named but doesn't take part in the event. If your selection is a non-runner, your bet will be void (and your stake returned). If the selection is part of a accumulator (multiple), the bet will become the next accumulative bet down, e.g. a treble becomes a double, a double becomes a single, etc.

                       <li>

                        Accumulator (Multiple) bets - void selections will be treated as non-runners within the bet, meaning If the selection is part of an accumulator (multiple), the bet will become the next accumulative bet down, e.g. a treble becomes a double, a double becomes a single, etc.

                       System bets are similar to accumulators or accumulators in that you choose several selections within one bet, but all possible combinations of bets from those selections are covered, with the advantage of winning even if not all picks are winners.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Systems bets are presented as two numbers separated by a slash: eg. 2/4, with the first number denoting the type of bets involved (in this case, doubles), and the second number denoting the number of selections involved.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       For example, in a 2/4 system bet, you would choose 4 selections and click on the System tab at the top of the bet slip, where you would then see your system bets options. The 2/4 system bet is made up of the 6 possible combinations using your 4 selections, so a stake of €0.50 would cost €3. Even if only 2 of those possible combinations were winners, your bet would win, with the return amount dependant on how many possible combinations actually win. If none or only one of your picks wins, your system bet loses. When you place your system bet, the amount of winnings shown is the maximum winnings possible if all picks win.

                       What is an Each-Way bet?
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      An Each-Way (E/W) bet is a bet consisted of two separate parts - a win part and a place part. The win part of the bet is on your selection to win the event, and the place part is on your selection to finish either first or within the race's specified place terms (e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc). The bet is very popular in horse racing since it allows you to gain returns even if your horse doesn't finish first.

                      <strong>
                       How do Each-Way bets work?
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      When you place an Each-Way bet (by ticking the e/w check box), your stake is doubled, with half allocated to the outright win, and the other half allocated to your runner finishing within the place terms. Each race has specified place terms depending on the number of runners, eg. ¼ 1-2-3. In this example, an Each-Way bet placed on a runner that finishes 1st will pay in two ways: you will win the outright portion of the bet, but you will also win the place portion at ¼ the outright odds as it finished in the top 3.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      <strong>
                       Example:
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You place a 2 EUR Each-Way bet on a 12/1 shot in a race with E/W terms ¼ 1-2-3
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If your selection finishes 1st:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                      <li>
                       You win 12 EUR plus your stake for the outright win
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       You also win 3 EUR (quarter the outright odds: 3/1) plus your stake for placing (ie. finishing in the top 3)
                      </li>
                     </ul>
                     <br/>
                     <p>
                      If your selection finishes 2nd or 3rd:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                      <li>
                       The outright portion of the bet will lose
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       You win 3 EUR plus your stake for placing
                      </li>
                     </ul>
                     <br/>
                     <p>
                      If your selection finishes outside the place terms for the race, both bets lose.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      <strong>
                       How do Each-Way Accumulators work?
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In the case of settling Each-Way Accumulators, the win portion of the first bet will be carried over to the win portion of the following bet, and similarly, the each-way portion of the bet will be carried over to the each-way portion of the following bet.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      <strong>
                       Example:
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You place a 1 EUR e/w accumulator on selection A in Race A and selection B in Race B. This means you have an outright (win) accumulator and a place accumulator
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If selection A wins and selection B only places, the outright portion of the accumulator will lose, but the place portion will win.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If selection A only places and selection B wins, again, the outright portion of the accumulator will lose, but the place portion will win.

                      The Asian Line is a special type of handicap used for soccer matches. Depending on the strength of each team, a handicap is issued for the game. This enables the odds for each side to be more similar, allowing for more competitive betting opportunities. All bets on the Asian Handicap in live betting (including 1st/2nd half bets) are settled according to the score line. Any goals prior to the bet being placed are ignored for settlement purposes.

                       In all cases, all selections must be successful to be a winner. If one or more selections from the accumulator are cancelled, the bet stands as soon as at least one of the remaining selections is settled as a winner or loser.

                       A non-runner is a selection that is named but doesn't take part in the event. If your selection is a non-runner, your bet will be void (and your stake returned). If the selection is part of a accumulator (multiple), the bet will become the next accumulative bet down, e.g. a treble becomes a double, a double becomes a single, etc.

                        Accumulator (Multiple) bets - void selections will be treated as non-runners within the bet, meaning If the selection is part of an accumulator (multiple), the bet will become the next accumulative bet down, e.g. a treble becomes a double, a double becomes a single, etc.

                       System bets are similar to accumulators or accumulators in that you choose several selections within one bet, but all possible combinations of bets from those selections are covered, with the advantage of winning even if not all picks are winners.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Systems bets are presented as two numbers separated by a slash: eg. 2/4, with the first number denoting the type of bets involved (in this case, doubles), and the second number denoting the number of selections involved.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       For example, in a 2/4 system bet, you would choose 4 selections and click on the System tab at the top of the bet slip, where you would then see your system bets options. The 2/4 system bet is made up of the 6 possible combinations using your 4 selections, so a stake of €0.50 would cost €3. Even if only 2 of those possible combinations were winners, your bet would win, with the return amount dependant on how many possible combinations actually win. If none or only one of your picks wins, your system bet loses. When you place your system bet, the amount of winnings shown is the maximum winnings possible if all picks win.

                      A teaser bet allows you to adjust the points spread and game totals on two or more American Football or Basketball teams by choosing a fixed number of points. The number of teams and points selected determines your payout odds.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                      All selections must be successful for the teaser bet to win. If a selection in a two team teaser is a push, the bet will be a loser. A push in teasers of more than two teams will result in the bet dropping to the next level down, if available, or losing if not.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Teaser bets will only be allowed on pre-match events and only for selected leagues, including:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      i. Regular teasers for NBA, NCAAB, NFL, NCAAF or any other league in which teaser bets are allowed (4, 4.5 and 5 for Basketball and 6, 6.5 and 7 for American Football)
                      <br/>
                      ii. SUPER TEASERS: 3 teams teaser - buying 8 points, ties lose, odds -120/1.83

                      iii. MONSTER TEASER: 4 teams teaser - buying 10 points, ties lose, odds -120/1.83

                      Buying points allows you to change the point-spread or game total of an American Football or Basketball game. You can move the point-spread so you get more points when betting the underdog, and fewer points when betting on the favourite. You can move the total so you get a higher total when betting the under or a lower total if betting the over.

                      All customer offers are limited to one per person, family, household address, email address, telephone number, same payment account number (e.g. debit or credit card, Skrill and etc.), shared computer (e.g. school, public library or workplace) and shared IP.

                      A Customer’s total Account Balance is comprised of the aggregate of their Sports Cash Account, Casino Cash Account, Sports Bonus Account and Casino Bonus Account. Withdrawals cannot be made from either of the Bonus Accounts, but they can both be used to make wagers. Funds from the Sports Bonus Account can be used to place wagers on “Sports”, “Live Betting”, “Virtuals” and “Games” products and funds from the Casino Bonus Account can be used to place wagers on “Casino” products.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Withdrawals may only be processed from your Sports Cash Account. Any withdrawals from your Casino Cash Account can only be made by first transferring your withdrawal amount to your Sports Cash Account and then requesting the Withdrawal be processed from the Sports Cash Account. Please note that any transfer of funds from the Casino Cash Account to the Sports Cash Account will be construed as a Withdrawal from the Casino Cash Account and may consequently result in the cancellation and forfeiture of “Casino” product bonuses and promotions.

                     <li>
                      Any wagers made are deducted from the Sports Cash Account or Casino Cash Account first, as the case may be. Real money funds will always be used to place wagers/bets before bonus funds.

                      All Betrally bonuses and promotions are intended for recreational players and Betrally may, in its sole discretion, limit the eligibility of Customers to participate in all or part of any promotion. Where a Customer transfers funds from their Sports Cash Account to Casino Cash Account for the sole purpose of realizing game play with funds from their Sports Bonus Account, and then transfers such funds back to the Customer’s Sports Cash Account without wagering them twice, such transfer shall be deemed as bonus manipulation (i.e. outside of recreational play) and the amount of the originally awarded sports bonus shall be deducted from the Customer’s account.

This will have the effect of removing the active Sports bonus from your account so that you can take up another promotion.

                     <li>
                      Unless otherwise specified, all bonus and promotion offers are only redeemable once per Customer and a Customer may have no more than one active Casino bonus and one active Sports bonus on his account at any given time.

                     <li>
                      Any bonus and any associated winnings will be automatically removed from a Customer's account upon the Customer requesting a Withdrawal before meeting the rollover or eligibility requirements of the applicable bonus.

                      Cashed-Out (including Partial Cash-Outs) bets shall not contribute to meeting the rollover or eligibility requirements of any Sports promotion.

                       Before any Withdrawal is processed, your play will be reviewed for any irregular playing patterns. In the interests of fair gaming, equal, zero or low margin bets or hedge betting, shall all be considered irregular gaming for the purpose of meeting any roll-over requirements. Other examples of irregular game play include but are not limited to (1) placing single wagers (a) equal to or in excess of 5% more of the value of the bonus credited to their account; or (b) equal to or in excess of 5% more of the value of the deposit used for claiming the bonus or (c) equal to or in excess of €6.25 (US$6.25) (whichever is lower of a, b or c) until such time as the wagering requirements for that bonus have been met; and (2) placing large bets which result in a substantial gain followed by a drop in bet size equal to or more than seventy five percent of the previous average bet size until the bonus roll-over requirements have been met. Should Betrally deem, at its sole discretion, that irregular game play has occurred, it reserves the right to withhold any Withdrawals and/or confiscate any associated winnings.

                     <li>
                      If you lost money gambling, how would you feel? Would it make you want to gamble more?

                     <p>
                      The following Self-Exclusion periods are available:

                     <p>
                      We will endeavor to apply your self-exclusion as soon as practically possible, however, please note that this process takes a reasonable working period to implement. We will not consider the self-exclusion period as having commenced until it has been fully implemented and communicated to you. If after this you find that you can still access any of our services, it is your responsibility to contact us immediately to inform us.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Any unsettled bets with Betrally at the time that you enter into self-exclusion will be settled on the result of the event. If your bet is a winner, your winnings will be automatically withdrawn to your applicable credit/debit card or other financial account from which the funds were deposited.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Please note that upon your selected self-exclusion period expiring, your account will be automatically re-activated.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It is possible to revoke Self-exclusion upon written request (and thereafter only after 24 hours has elapsed from the submitted written request), and Betrally will always do all it can to detect and close any new duplicate accounts that you may open. Once the self-exclusion is applied, you will also no longer receive any further marketing materials from us.

In the AFL, each quarter runs for 20 minutes plus time on – which makes up for time occupied in stoppages, such as when the ball going out of bounds, injuries, goals (or behinds) being kicked, or when the umpire is setting the angle of a free kick on goal. Time is kept by two off-field officials, known as \"timekeepers\", who sound the siren at the start and end of each quarter. A typical AFL quarter might run from 27 to 33 minutes, but may be even longer if, for instance, injuries cause delays. AFL breaks after the first and third quarters are six minutes, with a 20-minute break at halftime.[5] Thus, a match with quarters averaging 30 minutes would last about two and a half hours.</p>\n\n            <p>\n                <strong>1st Quarter / 2nd Quarter / 3rd Quarter / 4th Quarter</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>Bets settled on 1st/2nd/3rd/4th – Quarter Result final result only.</p>\n            <p>If a match is abandoned at any time those Quarter markets that are already determined will stand.</p>\n\n            <p>\n                <strong>1st Half / 2nd Half</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>Bets settled on the first/second half result only.</p>\n            <p>Bets will be void if the match is abandoned before half time.</p>\n            <p>If a match is abandoned during the second half all first half bets are still valid.</p>\n\n            <p>\n                <strong>Outright</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>As stated in the AFL regulations above and overall Outright settlement – bets are declared valid for settlement as stated on official final league position.</p>\n\n            <p>\n                <strong>First / Last to Score</strong>\n            </p>\n            <ul class=\"next_markets_ul\">\n                <li>Points – first / last to score any kind of point – goal or behind;</li>\n                <li>Goals – first / last to score Goal;</li>\n                <li>Behinds – first / last to score Behind;</li>\n            </ul>\n            <br>\n            <p>\n                <strong>Total Points / Goals / Behinds</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>Predict how many Points (combined between Goals & Behinds), Goals or Behinds (counted as separate scoring) – will be scored during the match. </p>\n\n            <p>\n                <strong>Winning Margin</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>Predict the Team to win the Match and the victory margin.</p>\n\n            <p>\n                <strong>Race To (Points / Goals / Behinds)</strong>\n            </p>\n            <p>Predict the Team to reach first to selected number of Points, Goals or Behinds during the match.</p>\n\n        </div>\n        <p class=\"last-update\">Version 2.

The win part of the bet is on your selection to win the event, and the place part is on your selection to finish either first or within the race's specified place terms (e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc). The bet is very popular in horse racing since it allows you to gain returns even if your horse doesn't finish first.</p>\n\n        <p>\n            <strong>How do Each-Way bets work?</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>When you place an Each-Way bet (by ticking the e/w check box), your stake is doubled, with half allocated to the outright win, and the other half allocated to your runner finishing within the place terms. Each race has specified place terms depending on the number of runners, eg. ¼ 1-2-3. In this example, an Each-Way bet placed on a runner that finishes 1st will pay in two ways: you will win the outright portion of the bet, but you will also win the place portion at ¼ the outright odds as it finished in the top 3.</p>\n\n        <p>\n            <strong>Example:</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>You place a 2 EUR Each-Way bet on a 12/1 shot in a race with E/W terms ¼ 1-2-3</p>\n        <p>If your selection finishes 1st:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>You win 12 EUR plus your stake for the outright win</li>\n            <li>You also win 3 EUR (quarter the outright odds: 3/1) plus your stake for placing (ie. finishing in the top 3)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <br>\n        <p>If your selection finishes 2nd or 3rd:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The outright portion of the bet will lose</li>\n            <li>You win 3 EUR plus your stake for placing</li>\n        </ul>\n        <br>\n        <p>If your selection finishes outside the place terms for the race, both bets lose.</p>\n\n        <p>\n            <strong>How do Each-Way Accumulators work?</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>In the case of settling Each-Way Accumulators, the win portion of the first bet will be carried over to the win portion of the following bet, and similarly, the each-way portion of the bet will be carried over to the each-way portion of the following bet.</p>\n\n        <p>\n            <strong>Example:</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>You place a 1 EUR e/w accumulator on selection A in Race A and selection B in Race B.

The 2/4 system bet is made up of the 6 possible combinations using your 4 selections, so a stake of €0.50 would cost €3. Even if only 2 of those possible combinations were winners, your bet would win, with the return amount dependant on how many possible combinations actually win. If none or only one of your picks wins, your system bet loses. When you place your system bet, the amount of winnings shown is the maximum winnings possible if all picks win.</p>\n            <p>You can see the details of active system bets by checking Open Bets under My Account.</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>Systems involving 3 selections</h3>\n\n        <h2 class=\"section-header inner-header\">\n            <span class=\"header-title\">System 2/3</span>\n        </h2>\n        <div class=\"section-holder\">\n            <p>A 2/3 system consists of 3 bets involving 3 selections in different events - 3 doubles.
