      <h3>
       We are offering one of the
     finest selections of embroidered and cut work table linens available on the net! We have
     high quality doilies, placemats, table runners and tablecloths not only for the
     individual, but retailers as well.
      </h3>
      <h4>
       As you can see from the sample pictures at left, our linens have elaborate embroidery
     and intricate cut work. These high-end pieces are made from 100% polyester (that means no
     shrinking, no fading and no ironing). They are manufactured in China explicitly for export
     to Europe and the United States. Please visit our
       <a href="prodcat.htm">

       We have tried to keep graphics to a minimum, but it would be impossible to show you
     our fine linens without using at least some pictures.  We have used compression and
     resizing techniques on most of our pictures in order to get them to load quickly, but it
     still might take a little time for a page to load, please try to be patient. Also, a few
     of the pictures are a little distorted, we will be happy to email you the original
     picture.  Please email your comments about this page to:
