       <p>
        As our client, you will want detailed, impartial information about the home you wish to purchase and a clear explanation of any defects.  We will help you make logical vs. emotional decisions based on our inspection and will work with you and your realtor to satisfy your concerns.
       </p>
       <ul>

         As our client, we are responsible only to you;
        </li>
        <li>
         We do one inspection per day - providing a quality report takes time – time on site and back at the office;
        </li>
        <li>
         You get an ASTTBC Certified and Consumer Protection BC (CPBC) Licensed Home Inspector
        </li>
        <li>
         You will have $1,000,000 Errors &amp; Omissions Insurance and $1,000,000 Liability Insurance – most inspectors limit their liability to the cost of the inspection.
        </li>

        Your home inspection process will include:
       </h3>
       <ul>
        <li>
         You provide us with your property address and general information on what you will be using the property for and let us know if you have any concerns about the property;
        </li>
        <li>
         We will agree on a time and date when you are available for the ‘walk-through’ portion of the inspection together;
        </li>
        <li>
         We will spend approximately 3 hours on site;
        </li>
        <li>
         We will arrange a 'walk-through' with you to review &amp; discuss what our inspection results indicated;
        </li>
        <li>
         We review the report together and you will receive a hard copy and an electronic version of your report;
        </li>
        <li>
         We will explain the inspection findings by assessing what will be your responsibility, or the current homeowners responsibility, to rectify concerns identified in the inspection.

        Professional!  All the way.  From first phone call. Being out of town, Checkhouse called me right after their inspection and we spent a good while going through their initial impressions.  Followed by a comprehensive, written report plus USB memory card of photos, felt like I had been there too.  Appreciated the list of recommendations to improve safety in the new home and areas that could use further improvement.

        Checkhouse Home Inspections were very thorough, detail-oriented, and knowledgeable and they took the time to properly inspect everything.  As first-time home buyers, we were grateful to find property inspectors who were able to put our mind at ease with regards to the many issues that need to be considered in buying a home.  We would strongly recommend Checkhouse.

        We picked Checkhouse to inspect our home as they were not affiliated with our realtor. We wanted the inspection for us, not to complete the sale regardless. Our law office commented it is the most professional inspection they have ever seen. We were very impressed by their qualifications, insurance and the inspection went above &amp; beyond.

        Hello Checkhouse Home Inspectors:
       </p>
       <p>
        We were very impressed with the genuine interest and concern that Checkhouse had for our needs.  They were very attentive to specific requests and provided a superbly detailed report.  Even after the inspection, Checkhouse Home Inspectors returned to the property to verify a couple of issues in the report and provide additional recommendations.  As former military personnel, we are accustomed to moving but have never had such a thorough inspection or such tremendous personal service.  We highly recommend them.

        Checkhouse Home Inspections,
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you so much for providing us our home inspection.  When we first looked at our potential new home, we fell in love with it.  Your services at CheckHouse Home Inspections simply made our decision much easier.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, you made the appointment set up time very accommodating, not only to our schedule, but also to the current home owners schedule.  Thank you! Your service and thorough attention to every single detail imaginable was impressive. We didn’t think it could get much better however, once we received your email report, then your hand delivered 30 page report and over 500 photos, we were convinced that your services and expertise made our final decision to buy our home!
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps staying within a compatible market is what CheckHouse Home Inspections does however, the time, expert detail, email report and final bound report with a USB digital photos, should be much more than what we were charged.  Incredible! Up-date, we just moved in and we are so happy!  Thank you again so much.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have and will continue to recommend your services at CheckHouse Home Inspections to friends, family and colleges.

        My husband and I chose Checkhouse  to do our home inspection when purchasing our home in Sun Peaks. We knew them personally through the community of Sun Peaks and were very impressed with the expertise they provided with their home inspection. They were very thorough with their walk through with us and having everything itemized on software is very convenient .
       </p>
       <p>
        I would highly recommend their services when purchasing your next home.

        Checkhouse provided me excellent, professional service and value.  They took the time to be thorough and observe all the details. I appreciated the walk through where they shared their expertise and taught me  the ins and outs of my property. Checkhouse took a good deal of stress out of buying my first home.

        As first time home owners, having a house inspection was extremely important to us. Checkhouse made this process so easy for us. Providing us with a very detailed summary on the house we ended up buying. So happy with their work and would hire them again in a heartbeat!

       <p>
        My wife and I are pleased to express our most sincere thanks for the very efficient, thorough and timely home inspection you completed for us recently.  We particularly appreciated that you communicated quickly with us any time we asked specific questions. And, your photo work really helped us to better interpret your very professional written report. As we said previously, we will not hesitate to use your service again.

        I found CheckHouse to be professional and incredibly thorough in their inspection, and was thrilled they also provided a suggested-to-do list that would help me sell my home.  I would definitely use them again and recommend them to others as well.

        We are happy with your professionalism... the fact that Checkhouse took the extra time and effort to ensure that the fine details were not missed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The time and effort that you took to explain your findings on the house was very well done and your report details, explanations and pictures were very professional.
       </p>
       <p>
        We would definitely recommend you to anyone that is looking for a quality detailed professional house inspection.
