And so it was with previous forecasts being revisited.

           Sales are key to any business but cash flow can scupper even the most profitable business…you need to pay salaries, buy assets, and pay the bills and rent. Slow cash flow can severely restrict growth and many companies are forced to slow to ensure that they can keep the lights on.

           From small businesses to big multinational companies, the way tax is done is soon going to change. That’s because HMRC is bringing in its ‘Making Tax Digital’ initiative, which will change the way tax returns are filed. The change means the annual tax return will become a thing of the past, with businesses required to submit information every three months.

           If you are running your own small business, it is certain that you will have to pay tax at some point. Where it can all get a bit confusing though is what tax applies to you, as there are quite a few different types of tax that businesses can pay. Some, for example, may only apply to limited companies which, if you are a sole trader, are not needed.

           Some buy to let landlords who haven’t taken into account the variety of tax changes within the sector may well soon be faced with problems. Research from Kent Reliance highlights that 20% of UK landlords have now either transferred property portfolios under the banner of a limited company or moved ownership over to a spouse. The research further highlights that one in seven of these landlords don’t actually understand the reasons behind this.
