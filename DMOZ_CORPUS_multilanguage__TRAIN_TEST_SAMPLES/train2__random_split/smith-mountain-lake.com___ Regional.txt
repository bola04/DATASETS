     Smith Mountain Lake
    </strong>
    , Virginia's most popular lake, offers superb recreational activities, 500 miles of shoreline, a wide variety of water sports, and affordable lakefront real estate. Known locally as "SML," it is the "Jewel of the Blue Ridge Mountains". This insiders' guide by 17-year lake residents includes Smith Mountain Lake vacation and relocation information. It's a comprehensive guide - laid out as a continuous webpage so that you can
    <em>
     print it out and bring it along
    </em>
    when you visit the lake. Except for two ads from SML's top real estate professional, the links on this webpage are unpaid - selected for their value to vacationers and to retirees considering SML.

   <h3>
    Smith Mountain Lake Vacation Rentals
   </h3>
   <p>
    SML self-catering vacation rentals are offered by the week, long weekend, and month - directly from homeowners and from vacation rental property managers. Rental rates vary by season, size of rental, and included amenities. Most are bargains when compared to other lakefront,
 oceanfront, and resort vacation rentals in the USA. For vacation lodging, call an SML
    <a href="#real-estate">
     real estate company
    </a>
    , or check online at Homeaway, VRBO, or AirBnB. Restaurants are plentiful, and there are two large supermarkets, so you won't go hungry!

    <strong>
     Peak-season
    </strong>
    (June-August) rates for Smith Mountain Lake waterfront vacation rentals run from $400-$4000/week, with size and amenities (rather than geographic location) the primary determinant of cost. During peak season, you'll typically need to check in and out on a Saturday, rent for a full week, and supply your own linens.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Mid-season
    </strong>
    (4-6 weeks preceding and following summer) you can expect warm pleasant weather, fewer visitors, modest discounts from peak rates, flexible check-in and check-out dates - plus weekend and daily rate options.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Low-season
    </strong>
    (generally mid-October through mid-April) you can expect mild weather,  fewer visitors, discounts of 20%-50% on your vacation rental, flexible check-in and check-out dates - plus weekend, daily, and monthly rate options.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many SML lakefront vacation rentals include a dock; ask if you need one for your boat. Public boat launching ramps are usually nearby. If you can't bring your own boat, marinas rent pontoon boats starting at $160/day. Most other power boats cost more - including PWCs (Seadoo, WaveRunners, etc.) and ski boats.

    About Smith Mountain Lake
   </h2>
   <img alt="SML (April); Photo Copyright 2006 Ted Pratt" class="right" height="160" src="TedPratt/Smith_Mountain_Lake_April.jpg" title="SML (April); Photo Copyright 2006 Ted Pratt" width="240"/>
   <p>
    Why is there a gorgeous, 40-mile long, 20,600 acre lake, with 500 miles of shoreline, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of rural southwestern Virginia? Because Smith Mountain Lake was created to generate electricity, and to help manage water flows downstream. The damming of the Blackwater and Roanoke Rivers formed this reservoir in a filling process that began on September 24, 1963 - and ended almost 2.5 years later on March 7, 1966. SML turned 50 in 2016!
   </p>
   <p>
    SML's surface covers 32 square miles. Its highest normal water level ("full pond") is 795 feet above sea level. There is typically very little seasonal variation in the water level. The daily variation for electricity production is 12-24 inches. During severe drought conditions, including 2007 and 2012, lake levels have fallen by five feet. Under extreme flood conditions, the water level could reach just a few feet below the top of the Smith Mountain Dam, which itself is 802 feet above sea level. (The US Army Corps of Engineers publishes a daily
    <a href="http://epec.saw.usace.army.mil/dailyrep.txt">
     water level report
    </a>
    that is also available
    <a href="http://www.smithmountainlakelevel.com/">
     graphically over time
    </a>
    .)
   </p>
   <p>
    Surrounded by mountains, Smith Mountain Lake's deepest point is about 250 feet, near the dam itself. Its "average" depth is 55 feet (for more stats, see
    <a href="http://www.lakelubbers.com/smith-mountain-lake-73/">
     Lakes for Vacation and Recreation
    </a>
    - Lakelubbers). Outside the lake's many coves in its main channel, 80-150 feet is typical. Water purity is excellent. Water temperatures invite swimming from May through September.
   </p>
   <p>
    SML residents are friendly and helpful, and are  exceptionally talented and generous volunteers of their time and money to local causes.

   </a>
   <p>
    Many retail stores and services are available around the lake. Most are located on or near Rt. 122, about five miles north and south of Hales Ford Bridge. There are two large, modern supermarkets, dozens of restaurants, a dozen banks, a dozen marinas, a YMCA, two libraries, physicians, dentists, veterinarians, real estate brokers, attorneys, accountants, and scores of independent retail stores. An urgent care center and a medical evacuation helicopter are located at Westlake, near the intersection of Routes 122 and 616. A second helipad is six miles away, at the Scruggs Volunteer Fire Department. Full-service hospitals, including a regional heart and trauma center, are 30-45 minutes away from the lake in Roanoke, Lynchburg, and Rocky Mount.

    Smith Mountain Lake in Movies:

   The 2012 independent film
   <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1699498/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">
    Lake Effects
   </a>
   features SML and stars Scottie Thompson, Jane Seymour, and Madeline Zima. It's an inspiring tale of a young L.A. corporate attorney raised on and later returning to SML. The 1991 comedy "
   <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/">
    What About Bob?
   </a>

    The west end of SML, including the unincorporated town of Moneta, is closest to
    <a href="https://www.visitroanokeva.com/plan/visitor-center/">
     Roanoke, Virginia
    </a>
    (population 100,000). The east end, including Huddleston, is closest to
    <a href="http://www.virginia.org/Listings/VisitorInformationCenters/LynchburgVisitorInformationCenter/">
     Lynchburg, Virginia
    </a>
    (population 70,000). Both Roanoke and Lynchburg are within 30-60 minutes drive time for most lake residents. Both small cities provide convenient "big-city" amenities like shopping malls - and modern regional airports where you can park your car inexpensively within a five-minutes' walk of the terminal, and be driving home (with your checked luggage) 20 minutes after your plane arrives.
   </p>
   <p>
    Smith Mountain Lake is home to about 22,000 permanent residents. It covers parts of three Virginia counties:

    The lake offers a wide range of housing types and real estate prices. It's a great time to buy, with a few bargains still available at prices that haven't been seen since 2005. Top realtors can show them to you by land or boat. Lakefront studio condo resales start at about $60K - while  about 200 single-family lakefront homes, on gently-sloping lots with SML's best views, sold in 2017 for $1 million to $3 million.
   </p>
   <p>
    With 500 miles of shoreline, you can find a first or second home in a quiet cove with just a few neighbors in sight - or retire to a well-planned community with shared or private amenities that include swimming pools, fitness facilities, boat slips with powered boat lifts, and golf courses.

   <p>
    Smith Mountain Lake real estate is
    <em>
     diverse and affordable
    </em>
    , especially when compared to similar real estate on the USA's coasts. You can buy a furnished home, and move in "tomorrow." For about $80K, you can buy a 300-400 square foot  lakefront "studio" or 1BR condo with a  lakeview. For $225K, you can get a 20-year-old 1200 square foot lakefront condo or townhouse. For $300K you may be able to snag an older 2BR-3BR lakefront home with 1,500 square feet, located on a shallow cove or a steep lot - or a modern, 2BR, 1,200 square-foot condo with a great view, boat slip, and golf privileges. $500K-$700K can buy you a well-maintained 3BR-4BR lakefront home with 3,000+ square feet, a dock with two boat slips and powered lifts, one acre of land and 200+ feet of waterfront. $750K+ buys a large and luxurious lakefront home with a mountainview and a deepwater dock, in a premium development with its own golf course. $1+ million buys one of the lake's 6,000+ square-foot luxury homes - possibly one that was featured on a recent SML Charity Home Tour.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before you buy, check the lake depth at the dock. If a dock and the surrounding water don't have a depth of at least 9-10 feet at "full pond", you may be unable to use your boat during extended droughts, when water levels can drop by five feet or more. It can also be difficult to climb down (and back up) from a fixed dock to a floating dock ("floater") during drought; ask to see how access to your boat will be provided.
   </p>
   <hr/>
   To see eight of the lake's most beautiful waterfront homes, attend the
   <a href="http://smlcharityhometour.com/">
    Smith Mountain Lake Charity Home Tour
   </a>
   . On the second weekend of October every year, more than 1,000 volunteers welcome many thousands of visitors to the three-day event. The event raises up to $200,000 that helps to fund eight local charities. Mark your calendar ... and bring your friends and family for a close-up view of some exceptional properties!
   <hr/>
   <p>
    Looking for an undeveloped lot? SML's lakefront is 75%-80% developed, but undeveloped lakefront lots are still available. You can pay $50K for a lot with water access, $100K for a steep lot with an inspiring lakeview, or $250K or more for a large lakefront lot that may already include a $50K dock. For a bit more, you can buy a waterfront lot with a coveted view of the Smith Mountain "gap."
   </p>

    If you consider buying a lot or home without a dock, ask your real estate buyer's agent (or attorney) to carefully check the dock-building regulations. You will need at least 100 feet of waterfront to add a new dock on your  lot. It's also possible that an existing dock was never properly permitted or that it was not built according to its approved plan. In that case, expensive remediation may be required before you can use the dock - or even before you can buy the property.

    Nearly all Smith Mountain Lake homes are built above the "100-year flood plain", 802 feet above sea level. 800 feet is the highest level ever recorded, in 1987. Lakefront properties with gentle slopes from 802 feet down to "full pond", 795 feet above sea level - plus a full view of the Smith Mountain "gap" at the dam - generally command the highest prices.

    If you're planning to buy a condo or house, and then offer it as a vacation rental to help pay the mortgage, be sure to first check county, subdivision, and homeowner association rules and regulations. Vacation rental restrictions and prohibitions are increasing as the popularity of vacation rentals grows. Bedford County (on the north side of SML) is much more friendly to vacation rentals than Franklin County.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you need high-speed Internet, fast cellular service, and cable TV access, Franklin County (on the south side of SML) is your best bet. In Bedford County, both can be hard-to-find. Cellular phone service, including Verizon's LTE and AT&amp;T's 3G, is accessible on much of the lake - but you should definitely test it yourself. Ask the homeowner or your realtor which services work there, and borrow their phones if necessary to test them. Ask to see the homeowner's cable TV, cellular, and Internet bills. There are many homes at every price point in all three counties surrounding the lake where high-speed Internet is still just a dream. The lake's three county governments are working with providers, trying to change that.

    Smith Mountain Lake Development Issues
   </h3>
   <p>
    Until 2007, the rapid pace of development had residents and three county governments scrambling to protect the lakefront environment and to provide new infrastructure. The recession slowed development and reduced those pressures, but new construction is again underway.
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="Smith Mountain Lake (February); Photo Copyright 2006 Ted Pratt" class="right" height="180" src="TedPratt/Smith_Mountain_Lake_February.jpg" title="Smith Mountain Lake (February); Photo Copyright 2006 Ted Pratt" width="240"/>
    Lake water quality is preserved as responsible new home construction retains natural waterfront buffers of native trees and vegetation that filter lake pollutants like lawn fertilizers and pesticides. SML water quality is excellent, largely due to the vigilance of organizations like
    <a href="http://www.smlassociation.org">
     Smith Mountain Lake Association
    </a>
    (SMLA) and
    <a href="http://sml.us.com/">
     Tri-County Lake Administrative Commission
    </a>
    (TLAC).
   </p>
   <p>
    In 2005, all three lakefront counties passed new regulations that forbid the feeding of waterfowl within 500 feet of the lake, to help control water quality. In 2007, Franklin County began a program to enforce regular five-year maintenance and pump-out of septic systems near the lake. Boaters are forbidden to dump wastes of any kind into Smith Mountain Lake. SMLA has recorded and publicized water quality test results continuously since 1987 - a database that is unmatched by any other major lake in the USA - supported by dozens of residential volunteers and by generous Ferrum College faculty and their students.
   </p>
   <p>
    Aggressive invasive weeds pose a major threat to most U.S. and Virginia lakes, but not to Smith Mountain Lake. The three counties surrounding SML initially responded with funding for targeted chemical treatments to limit weeds' spread. In 2013, sterile grass carp (voracious consumers of hydrilla and other invasive weeds) were introduced to the lake - in controlled numbers carefully calculated to limit their
    <img alt="SML (November); Photo Copyright 2006 Ted Pratt" class="left" height="160" src="TedPratt/Smith_Mountain_Lake_November.jpg" title="SML (November); Photo Copyright 2006 Ted Pratt" width="240"/>
    effect on desireable native vegetation. That program has been very successful; grass carp are added each year as needed, in weed-impacted areas.
   </p>
   <p>
    Invasive, non-native zebra mussels are a threat, migrating southeast from the Great Lakes and hitchhiking nationwide on trailered boats from infested lakes. SML so far remains free of these noxious pests, which have no natural enemy or chemical treatment; they cannot be remediated. Virginia is one of just 17 states that remain uninfested, and is surrounded by states that are - except for mussel-free North Carolina. SMLA is investigating the most effective means to block their arrival - and other aquatic invasive species (AIS). Invasive species are illegal to transport here; visitors should "

   <p>
    Lakefront residential property taxes in all three lakefront counties are about 1/2 of 1% of fair market value; a $500,000 property is taxed at about $2,500/year. Properties are reassessed once every four years. The 2011 and 2015 county assessments of lake-area homes were reduced - following a 25% to 75% increase in 2007. Throughout Virginia, there is no reduction of taxes for primary homes or for low-income or retired homeowners. Taxes are assessed at fair market value, and everyone in a county pays the same property tax rate.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is no local "town level" of government at Smith Mountain Lake, so the three lake-surrounding county governments face new demands for public services like law enforcement, traffic safety enforcement, road improvements, and trash removal, plus new infrastructure needs like public water and sewage. The lake's first public water line was laid by Bedford County in 2005; Franklin County became a partner and extended it across the county line. Bedford County began construction of sewage lines and a treatment facility in 2005; Franklin County sharing some costs and continues to explore feasibility.
   </p>

   <p>
    The three county governments and Appalachian Power Company control lake development. Ferrum College and volunteer organizations like SMLA and TLAC monitor water quality. Some local residents and organizations want to establish an additional local level of taxation and control - a special tax district or a town of Smith Mountain Lake spanning all three lakefront counties, to support an increase in tax-based services provided around the lake. The result would be dedicated funding for critical needs like water quality, at the expense of higher taxes. Most residents have opposed a lake-based tax district.

    America's Best Ice Cream?
   </h3>
   <p>
    We think that this small local dairy makes America's best ice cream, and the National Ice Cream Retailers 
            Association awarded their chocolate a blue ribbon (first place) in 2016. Homestead's ice cream cones are 
 		   large and reasonably priced. Cones are available at the dairy in Burnt Chimney (Wirtz), and at a 
            food trailer (summer weekends) located at the "General Store" on Rt. 616 in Westlake (Moneta). You can also buy 
            $5 quarts at the dairy, and at some local food markets (including Kroger). This is a treat that you 
            won't want to miss when you visit Smith Mountain Lake. [No, we have no connection to the dairy.]

    Booker T. Washington National Monument
   </h3>
   <p>
    Many lake visitors stop to see the
    <a href="http://www.nps.gov/bowa/index.htm">
     Booker T. Washington National Monument
    </a>
    . The monument is one of only twelve African-American history sites of the 425 National Park Service units in existence. It was constructed in June of 1957 by Presidential Proclamation. The park commemorates the life of Booker T. Washington. It's a unique experience that allows the American public to view what slavery was like and how the plantation system worked. Located on the old Burrough's plantation, it allows people to see how unkindly most slaves were treated.

   <p>
    Booker Taliaferro Washington was born a slave on the Burrough's tobacco plantation in 1856 and died in 1915. After being freed at age 9, he left the plantation to pursue an education. He is now remembered internationally as an educator, author, orator, college president, and spokesman for African-Americans.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Booker T. Washington National Monument includes preserved plantation buildings - slave quarters, a tobacco barn, a smokehouse, and a tool shop. There are also farm animals - pigs, ducks, turkeys, geese, chickens, and cows - for children (and their parents) to enjoy. The monument is open year-round from 9:00AM- 5:00PM, excluding Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.

    National D-Day Memorial
   </h3>
   <img alt="National D-Day Memorial" class="right" height="100" src="dday.jpg" title="National D-Day Memorial" width="90"/>
   <p>
    June 6, 1944 forever changed the course of history. Yet in the United States, there was no National Memorial to D-Day ... until the summer of 2001, when the architecturally stunning
    <a href="http://www.dday.org">
     National D-Day Memorial
    </a>
    opened in nearby Bedford, Virginia.
   </p>
   <p>
    The National D-Day Memorial Foundation is a nonprofit educational organization established to maintain a memorial complex for the nation's remembrance of D-Day. The Foundation exists to memorialize the valor, fidelity, and sacrifice of the Allied Armed Forces on D-Day, June 6, 1944.
   </p>
   <p>
    The multi-million dollar memorial is a moving tribute to the thousands of young men who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy France to ensure freedom and democracy worldwide. Bedford Virginia was chosen as the home for the memorial because Bedford lost the most men per capita of any United States municipality on D-Day. Take your camera, and be sure to capture the beautiful view of the Blue Ridge Mountains - including the Peaks of Otter - from the grounds of the Memorial.
   </p>
   <p class="location">

     Location
    </em>
    : The National D-Day Memorial is located in Bedford County, Virginia, about 30 minutes' drive north of Smith Mountain Lake. The memorial is located at the interchange of State Routes 460 Bypass and 122, in the city of Bedford, between Roanoke and Lynchburg, Virginia. 540-586-DDAY.

    When you boat at SML, please be careful and courteous. The
    <a href="https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/boating/">
     Virginia Department of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries
    </a>
    is an excellent source of information about safe boating, boating laws, and public access ramps. Here are some highlights for new boaters at SML ...
   </p>
   <h3>
    Clean, Drain, and Dry for 7 Days!
   </h3>
   <p>
    SML is free of most non-native, aquatic invasive species (AIS), and we want to keep it that way. You can help by NOT allowing weeds, zebra mussels, and other noxious aquatic hitchhikers to come to the lake with you - on your boat or boat trailer.
    <strong>
     You are our first line of defense

   <h3>
    Boating Courtesy and Safety at Smith Mountain Lake
   </h3>
   <p>
    Smith Mountain Lake is Virginia's busiest recreational freshwater body. In 2006, the Virginia Assembly increased funding for enforcement of boating safety and noise laws; Virginia's Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (DGIF) increased the number and visibility of patrols on the lake's 20,600 acres. In 2007, the Virginia Assembly passed a law mandating safe boating education for operators that has been phasing in, by age group, over several years.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Safety Equipment
     </strong>
     : You are required by law to carry this safety equipment in your boat: a wearable and properly-sized personal floatation device for each rider; a whistle or horn, a fire extinguisher, a flat throwable flotation cushion, your boat rental agreement (if applicable) and your boat registration certificate.
     <strong>
      Children under 13 are required by Coast Card rules to wear a personal floatation device
     </strong>
     . If you violate any of these safety equipment laws, prepare to pay a $65 fine and processing fees.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      No Wake Coves
     </strong>
     : In a no-wake cove (indicated by no-wake buoys) you are required by law to operate your boat at your boat's lowest possible navigable forward speed. If you don't, prepare to pay a $65 fine and processing fees.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Other Rules and Regulations
     </strong>
     : Please review Virginia boating regulations carefully before you boat at SML! You can get a copy at any marina.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Boating Violations
     </strong>
     : To report boating violations on Smith Mountain Lake, call the Virginia Wildlife Crime Line at 800-237-5712 from 7AM-5PM daily. Be sure to record the boat registration number before you call. A description of the boat's operator and passengers will help, as will a second witness (preferably not related to you).

    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    All Virginia boat operators must show proof that they have received safety education. An attempt to exclude boaters older than 42 from the safety education requirement is opposed by SMLA and the SML Chamber of Commerce. An SML legislator, Sen. Bill Stanley, is a leader in the effort to weaken the law. The weakening legislation was defeated in 2015, but may be reintroduced in 2017.
   </p>
   <p>
    SMLA successfully lobbied for the boater safety education mandate, but their request for boating speed limits failed to pass the Virginia legislature in 2007 and 2008. There are no boating horsepower limits on SML.

   <h3>
    Smith Mountain Lake Public Boat Launches/Ramps
   </h3>
   <p>
    If you bring your boat to SML, please
    <strong>
     first clean your boat, boat trailer, and bait box
    </strong>
    - to prevent fouling Smith Mountain Lake with invasive weeds or zebra mussels that you may have picked up on another body of water.
    <strong>
     Invasive weeds can quickly grow so thickly that they prevent navigation
    </strong>
    near boat ramps and in shallow coves. Don't wash your boat near the water because hitchhiking weeds, weed fragments, or zebra mussel eggs ("veligers") can wash into the lake. Instead, power wash your boat and trailer at a car wash away from the lake -
    <strong>
     there are several off-water car washes nearby
    </strong>
    . And don't forget to thoroughly clean your bait box and lures to remove all plant materials. SML is currently free of zebra mussels, and we want to keep it that way!
   </p>
   <p>

    How the Smith Mountain Dam Works
   </h2>
   <img alt="Gap at Smith Mountain Dam; Photo Copyright 2003 Brian Raub" class="left" height="135" src="sml-gap.jpg" title="Gap at Smith Mountain Dam; Photo Copyright 2003 Brian Raub" width="180"/>
   <p>
    Built and operated by Appalachian Power Company, Smith Mountain Lake and Dam (the "
    <a href="http://www.smithmtn.com/">
     Smith Mountain Project
    </a>
    ") was first conceived in 1924. But many considered the project impractical until the pouring of concrete at Smith Mountain Gap began in June 1961. By November 1962, Virginia roads and bridges that would be affected by the lake had been rebuilt. On September 24, 1963, the Smith Mountain Dam was closed and the lake began to form. Two and one-half years later, on March 7, 1966, the 20,600-acre Smith Mountain Lake reached full-pond at 795 feet above sea level.
   </p>
   <img alt="Smith Mountain Dam; Photo Copyright 1998 Brian Raub" class="right" height="135" src="smith-mountain-lake-dam-2.jpg" title="Smith Mountain Dam; Photo Copyright 1998 Brian Raub" width="180"/>
   <p>
    Smith Mountain Dam is 235 feet tall, 816 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Its five hydroelectric power-generating units produce 656,000 kilowatts. The first four units cost $66 million in 1964; the fifth unit cost $37 million in 1979.
   </p>
   <p>
    The operation of Smith Mountain Dam uses two natural resources, water and coal, through a process known as pumped storage. Water from Smith Mountain Lake goes through turbine generators in the Smith Mountain Dam powerhouse and produces electricity. Instead of the "used" water rushing downstream, much of it is caught by the Leesville Dam, a smaller dam below Smith Mountain Dam. The water is then pumped back into Smith Mountain Lake and used again. Some passes through turbine generators in Leesville, making more electricity.
   </p>
   <img alt="Smith Mountain Dam; Photo Copyright 1998 Brian Raub" class="left" height="135" src="smith-mountain-lake-dam-3.jpg" title="Smith Mountain Dam; Photo Copyright 1998 Brian Raub" width="170"/>
   <p>
    Since electricity demand is highest on weekdays, generation usually takes place then. Then, at low demand times - nights, holidays, and weekends - water is pumped from Leesville back to Smith Mountain Lake. The power to pump water comes mostly from American Electric Power via transmission lines. Since power plants work most efficiently near their full load levels, the pumped storage benefits the Smith Mountain Lake Dam power plant by keeping loads high.

    Getting to Smith Mountain Lake

   </a>
   <p>
    If you're traveling
    <strong>
     by car
    </strong>
    , there are many ways to reach the lake. Most approaches involve challenging mountain roads that can be treacherous for the uninitiated, especially at night. Here's a route that's not the shortest possible - but it's nearly free of bad curves. Follow I-81 toward Roanoke, then I-581 east approximately 7 miles to State Rt. 24 (I-581 Exit 6). Follow State Rt. 24 east for about 22 miles until you reach State Rt. 122. Follow State Rt. 122 southwest about 6 miles to Moneta. Moneta is just north of the only major bridge that crosses Smith Mountain Lake and offers easy access to any part of the lake.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you enjoy driving
    <strong>
     winding mountain roads
    </strong>
    , consult a map and try approaching Moneta
    <strong>
     daytime
    </strong>
    via Rt. 43 (toughest), Rt. 116 "Windy Gap", the Blue Ridge Parkway to its Virginia Rt. 24 exit, or Rt. 634 "Hardy Road" (easiest).

    If you plan to arrive
    <strong>
     by private airplane
    </strong>
    , there's a general aviation airport, Smith Mountain Lake Airport (airport identifier:
    <strong>
     <a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/w91">
      W91
     </a>
    </strong>
    ), with a 3,100-foot paved runway. It's located in Bedford County on the north side of the lake, about 2 miles from SML State Park, at 1090 Cutlass Rd., Moneta. Contact: Joe Borgess, Owner/Operator. 540-297-4500.

      ROA
     </a>
    </strong>
    , 50 flights daily) is located 30-75 minutes northwest of SML. The smaller Lynchburg Virginia Airport (
    <a href="http://www.lynchburgva.gov/airport">
     LYH
    </a>
    , 12 flights daily) is located to the northeast, 30-75 minutes from the lake. The Greensboro NC Airport (
    <a href="http://www.flyfrompti.com/">
     GSO
    </a>
    , about 60 flights daily), aka Piedmont Triad International Airport is located 75-120 minutes south of Smith Mountain Lake. Airport drive times vary widely because the lake itself is 40 miles long. Be sure to
    <strong>
     check airfares
    </strong>
    at all three airports.
