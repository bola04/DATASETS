       After her first semester of college in L.A., a Midwestern girl brings an outrageous young man from school back to the farm for Thanksgiving so she can get out of committing to her old boyfriend from high school.

       <br/>
       This was pretty bad, but almost "good bad", and I confess to chuckling a few times. Don't make this your evening's main entertainment, but on a two-movie night this might be the perfect piece to wind down.

       A man in dire need of escaping the tedium of his suburban life ties air balloons to a chair to see if they will lift him in the air, to discover that his cooky idea works all too well as he is carried high into the skies, to finally land in a country town where, incognito and while half the country is looking for him, he starts to live a blissful life among fast friends.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Don't expect big laughs out of this cute little rom-com—even though every viewer knows this moment is coming all along, my biggest chuckle was when the chair is airlifted—but I expect you'll find it entertaining enough for the demands of a movie date. The lead character has that constant smirk that most will find charming and a few irritating. Although not in the same league as

       , it is a worthwhile window into Australian culture.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I'm not sure how I managed to miss the movie when it came out—I was living in a suburb of Sydney then—but watching the film fifteen years later arouses nostalgia for a country that has known such growth and other changes that in many respects it is no longer recognizable.

       as much as the next northerner.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I nearly gave up, but there was just enough to keep me watching (decent cast, endearing characters), and the second half was far superior to the first, starting with the sales seminar scene. Overall, probably not worth your time, not because the movie is bad, but because there are better ones to choose from.

       This movie was probably classified as a comedy because Ben Stiller is in it, but in fact it should properly be tagged as a light-hearted drama.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As a result, don't expect laughs here. Nevertheless, the movie is solid and contemplates a time in a person's life (the years around fifty) that rarely seems to be the object of a film's attention.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As he takes his son around Boston to college interviews, the main character is led to examine his life, and sees his place in life in a poor light compared with the achievements of  his former peers. Stiller does a great job, and the actor who plays the role of the son does even better—perhaps chiefly because his face is less well-known.

       If the focus of this site were light-hearted movies rather than laugh-out-loud comedy, this film would rank pretty high, although it does get heavy at times, especially towards the end. On the laughter dimension, I came out empty-handed on this second viewing after a twenty-odd year gap, although I did chuckle once.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The movie shows us the world through the eyes of a man with a low IQ (I'll refrain from adding "but high sensitivity"). At first I got the impression that the film was going to be about the wisdom of the fool—the eternal theme of the simple man having a deeper understanding of life than his brethren. Fortunately, there was more to it than that, otherwise the nearly-three-hours of reels would have been unbaringly preachy.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Part of the comedy lies in the fact that unwillingly, our character gets to play a part in frontline events and achieves some outstanding deeds—without seeming to care one bit about the ensuing glory. By and large, he does things because he feels like doing them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Although the movie is sappy at times, it is a real treat in other moments. Overall, I would place it on the shelf of the guilty pleasures of American cinema. Let the record state that I am glad that shelf exists.

       If you've bought the propaganda according to which Australia is a paradise, this movie is probably the right medicine. The topic is the race riots that took place south of Sydney pitting "white Australians" against Australians of Middle Eastern extraction (also "white", mind you, just not blond). After failing to even smile after close to twenty minutes, I gave up on it as I was in the mood for comedy, but the movie doubtless has documentary value.

       A wife and two mistresses team up to punish their unfaithful man. I decided to watch this movie because of an imdb review from someone stating that they couldn't stop laughing. It saddens me, then, to have to report that I couldn't
       <i>

       laughing. The theme is certainly perfect for comedy, and I would love to watch it properly executed. Perhaps that film already exists in the vast repository of world comedies—I hope to hear about it someday from someone writing from a place such as France, Italy or Egypt.

       A stand-up comedian of Pakistani origins cannot tell his family about his "white" girlfriend because he is expected to go along with his mom's wish for an arranged marriage. Although this sweet movie had no laughs, it had a lot of humor and a fine script. I relished spending more time with one of the actors from the TV show
       <i>
        Silicon Valley
       </i>
       —in fact the entire cast did a fine job.

       This mockumentary purports to tell the story of two men who fought a seven-day match at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Sometimes crude, sometimes subtle, this 45-minute film probably has enough to make most people laugh. Actual tennis celebrities such as John McEnroe make guest appearances.

       This forty-minute mockumentary alleges to document the 1982 Tour de France and the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs on that event. It's uneven—sometimes fairly subtle, sometimes awfully crass—but there should be enough in there to keep you entertained for the length of this short film.

       Seeing that Eastern European assassins have connived with an Interpol mole to kill a world-class hitman before he can testify in court against a dictator, an Interpol officer hires her ex-boyfriend (a world-class bodyguard) to accompany the hitman to court. Tired already?

       Apart from the fake imdb ratings, there isn't much to recommend this movie. There were (a few) funny moments, but overall the script is pathetic and the movie one big yawn, even if you usually enjoy Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, as we do.

       An executive discovers that making people disappear is a pleasant and easy way to remove the various hurdles in his life. Michael Caine's performance was delightful. One of those tight comedies which, although it probably won't make you laugh, may leave you with a glow from smiling for ninety minutes.

       I know that for some Mel Brooks is a big reference in comedy, but I just don't seem to like any of his movies. This one is a little less chaotic than others I'd attempted, and at least I was able to make myself watch it till the end. I had to—
       <i>
        Blazing Saddles
       </i>
       is something of a cultural icon.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On the verge of being destroyed by bandits, a town telegraphs the governor asking for a new sheriff. Being black, the one who is appointed must overcome the citizens' prejudice. He is soon joined by a skillful sidekick, played by Gene Wilder.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The movie still failed to make me laugh, but it has some redeeming qualities, not least of it its sweetness. If this is the effect even
       <i>
        Blazing Saddles
       </i>
       has on me, I won't be trying to watch (and review) other films by Mel Brooks. For the most part, my impression has been that they are best suited to the mindset of thirteen year-old boys, from the mixture of grand phrases with crassness to the interplay of various levels of reality.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Lucky for us, there are movies to suit just about every sense of humor. If Mel Brooks fits yours, please enjoy.

       All the tapes at a struggling video rental store get erased. To limit the damage, the staff start shooting their own versions of blockbuster movies and meet unexpected success. This was sweet and well-intentionned but fairly boring.

       Flying to California to spend Christmas with their daughter who is studying at Stanford, a prim couple (and their teenage son) discover that their daughter (and sister) is living with a foul-mouthed video game millionaire. The theme is a welcome echo to the now classic

       , and although the laughs are not as forthcoming, the movie is funny and probably memorable. As long as you don't expect to crack a rib laughing, you probably won't be disappointed popping this in for a bit of mindless Sunday night entertainment.

       Two cops behave violently. Apart from that, I can't tell much about this movie as we gave up about fifteen minutes. Not only did we not once laugh, we had a hard time with the actors' diction. If Americans are needing subtitles in order to understand an American movie, maybe someone is going a bit too far.

       A man who only judges women on their looks is hypnotized into seeing their inner beauty, and starts dating a large woman whom he believes to have a model-like figure. This was a sweet movie, and it could be recommended as a Sunday night rom-com to watch with your honey. I didn't laugh, but it certainly wasn't torture as I like Jack Black and Jason Alexander (George from

       In this set Doug had a few good points. I do appreciate good points, but there's a whole world of non-fiction writing that can supply enough of those. The main reason I watch stand-up is to laugh, and the set didn't make me laugh—not once—which saddened me as I thought Doug had done a surprisingly good job of staying in funny shape on the last tape that I'd watched,
       <i>

         Beer Putsch Hall

       . I hope he bounces back as I would hate to lose him as the lone star that he is on the stand-up skyscape.

       This comedy explores the attitudes of a San Diego high school's pupils to relationships, drugs, study, work—and surfing.  Although I found the movie funny, it didn't really make me laugh. But that's alright. First, for anyone who was approximately that age in the 1980s, the texture is a delight. Second, you'll recognize young actors who went on to have a long Hollywood career. The character of Sean Penn as a dopehead surfie dude might by itself make the movie worth a watch.

       This movie came highly recommended by a reader. After expressing the wish they had each other's life, two best friends wake up to a big surprise: they have swapped bodies! Dave is a work-focused lawyer and father of three, Mitch is a dilettante and a playboy. This movie made me laugh hard. It's not afraid to stir the pot with taboo subjects such as everyone's "perfect" babies. It contains adult themes on a similar level to
       <i>
        <a href="movies.html?m=bridesmaids#top">
         Bridesmaids
        </a>
       </i>
       and

         Harold &amp; Kumar
        </a>
       </i>
       , but it is almost never crass. The opening sequence does feature the grossest shot I've ever seen on film, but it's funny. If you can take a bit of foul language and minor nudity, this is a must-watch.
       <br/>
       <br/>

        Edit:
       </b>
       upon watching a second time five years later, I was a bit disappointed as the movie didn't make me laugh as much as I expected. Still a pleasant watch, but this may be my last visit.

       is that it is always a pleasure to revisit Owen Wilson as a jerk. The movie entertained us and gave us a few laughs: don't let the low imdb rating put you off, this is a decent little comedy.

       A high-school senior becomes infatuated with the young woman who replaces him on the football team. This Scottish movie is just delightful. It is full of humor, but with a light touch—so even though we didn't laugh, we chuckled and smiled a lot.

       Two unemployed actors living in squalid conditions escape to a rural retreat, soon to realize they are unsuited to country life and ill-equipped to relate to the local characters. Parts of the movie were loud and loudly acted (I'm not one for theatrical performances), but I enjoyed the character of the quirky uncle. This is probably a memorable movie, but not one I'd recommend if you're looking for a laugh.

       Thanks to an alien power, an ordinary man suddenly receives the gift of making any of his wishes come true. I warmly recommend you watch

        absolutely anything

       in which Simon Pegg or Eddie Izzard they appear—except for this film, which is a waste of their talents. The voices of the Pythons used for the aliens are not a redeeming feature. For a similar premise that has a chance of actually making you laugh, try

       Three birding enthusiasts compete to be the one who will spot the most bird species in a calendar year. The commitment to the competition takes a toll on their professional and family lives.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jack Black, Steve Martin and Owen Wilson made a balanced triangle, and the story-line was unusual. While this is certainly not a laugh-out-loud comedy (the rare bird that this site aims to spot) this was a very cute movie that made me smile a lot.

       A destitute musician impersonates his roommate to get hired as a school teacher at a prep school, where he undertakes to instruct his class in Rock'n Roll.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The premise reminded me of

       </i>
       (which this movie predates by ten years). Although there were no hard laughs, the movie was consistently funny, thanks both to the kids and to Jack Black, who saved no energy putting on this impressive performance. A fun watch.

       The lives of three sisters and connected characters are placed under the microscope in this intimate movie which makes you both cringe and smile. In that way, it is in the line of some of Woody Allen's films and can be seen as a precursor to TV series such as
       <i>
        <a href="movies.html?m=the-office#top">
         The Office
        </a>
       </i>
       . No laugh-out-loud moment, but a hypnotic and entertaining watch.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <i>
        Happiness
       </i>
       is the origin of the famous line "I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you." It is one of the movies that helped establish Philip Seymour Hoffman, who will be missed.

       If you can stomach some foul language and adult themes, this movie will probably give you a few good laughs. Given the task of finding suitable dates to bring to a wedding in Hawaii, two brothers advertise on Craig's list and recruit two young women who turn out to be as much of a disaster as they are. The movie is uneven but has enough good moments to make it worth a watch.

       In the days leading up to the start of the college year, the players of the school's baseball team get acquainted and do their best to meet the ladies. High marks for the soundtrack and the 1970s texture, zero on laughs.

         The movie "screwed" about the butler that steals his bosses dog it's hilarious. It ends up turning into a big adventure that deals with theft, kidnapping, extortion (ransom) and attempting to get back at a mean boss, but everyone involved learns something at the end of the day about themselves and each other, all in all pretty funny. However it does start out a little slow.

         Hi Elijah,
 Thanks for your advice! I'd love to watch it. 
 It looks like there are two Old Dogs.
 Do you mean this one
 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976238
 or this one?

 Wishing you a fun day

         Hi Faye,
         <br/>
         <br/>
         &gt;you missed a movie! Where is Mash?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I put Mash into the search box. This came out:
 http://www.laughdb.com/movies.html?m=mash
         <br/>
         <br/>
         But thank you for trying to improve the database, always looking for things I've missed!
         <br/>
         <br/>
         And feel free to add your comments to the Mash page, as my review only reflects one person's taste. :)
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Wishing you a beautiful week,

        <div class="comment-text">
         Horrible Bosses is the funniest movie I have EVER seen! By far.
         <br/>
         Very funny movies:
         <br/>
         Stealing Harvard
         <br/>
         Evolution
         <br/>
         Sorority Boys
         <br/>
         Old School
         <br/>
         Newer movies that were pretty funny:
         <br/>
         friends with benefits
         <br/>
         no strings attached
