        One of the key reasons companies, such as Lynn Crenshaw's, outsource is cost savings.

        Benefits to having an outsourcing consultant for your business
       </h1>
       <p>
        Future work places will require greater HR adaptability.  Alignment with goals and company objectives will require incorporating an Outsourced Human Resource Specialist/Generalist Professional who will ensure that your business stays focused on growth, customer services and product development.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key reasons companies outsource is cost savings;  Some research suggests that companies could save as much as 30% annually on Special Projects or other daily business necessary functions.
       </p>
       <p style="text-indent: 1px;">
        When organizations utilize an outsourcing consultant who is capable of providing fully integrated HR outsourcing solutions, the organization can  focus on its core business.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the workforce becomes more global, the cost of integrating workers will increase.  Those companies who outsource this function will achieve a more integrated workforce at a cost savings advantage.
       </p>
       <p>
        By outsourcing HR functions, small organizations can re-invest their dollars back into the company versus paying a full-time HR employee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your outsourcing consultant will be solely responsible for ensuring that your organization is in compliance with employment, termination and FMLA issues, just to name a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        An outsourcing consultant will provide your organization with the most up-to-date technology systems that will maximize the fit between your employees and how you do business.
