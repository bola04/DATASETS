         <p>
          The incidence of esophageal cancer has risen in recent decades accounting for 1.5% of all invasive cancers in 1996 alone.
          <i>
           <sup>
            5
           </sup>
          </i>
          Occurring anywhere in the esophagus, the cancer can exist as a stricture, mass, or plaque.
         </p>
         <p>
          The most common symptom of esophageal cancer is dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing and the sensation that food is sticking on the way down the esophagus. Stents serve to bridge the obstruction in the esophagus and reestablish luminal patency.
         </p>
         <p>
          Complications surrounding esophageal stents include overgrowth, ingrowth, and migration, and should be considered when choosing a stent for a patient. Manufacturers have been developing new ways to reduce and, when possible, eliminate these complications from occurring.
         </p>
         <p>
          The first stents were composed of decalcified ivory and were eventually replaced by plastic stents. While plastic stents continue to be used today, primarily for reasons of cost, metal self-expanding stents are now the most widely accepted.
         </p>
         <p>
          Studies have shown that while both plastic and metal prostheses can be effective, fewer stent-related complications occur with metal stents.
         </p>
         <p>
          Coated stents are becoming increasingly common because of their ability to prevent tumor ingrowth.
         </p>
         <p>
          Stents have proved to be a reliable way to alleviate dyphagia, which, without treatment, leads to a poor quality of life, rapid weight loss, and a relatively quick and unpleasant death from total dysphagia and aspiration of the patient’s own saliva.
          <i>
           <sup>
            4
           </sup>
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          One clinical investigation states: “Considering current survival outcomes, it is undesirable to distress these patients with painful and time consuming procedures, prolonged hospitalization, or repetitive treatment sessions. In view of the short life expectancy of these patients, stent placement proves to be a safe and cost effective method for management of dysphagia in malignant esophageal obstruction.”
          <sup>
           5
          </sup>
         </p>
         <p>
          Studies show that 90% of patients can return to eating normal foods again following stent placement.
          <sup>
           1
          </sup>
         </p>
         <p>
          Boston Scientific Microvasive Endoscopy offers two lines of self-expanding metal stents. The Wallstent® and Ultraflex™ esophageal stents are designed to maintain esophageal luminal patency in esophageal strictures caused by intrinsic and/or extrinsic malignant tumors, and occlusion of concurrent esophageal fistula.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Wallstent has an angled, uncovered flare-end design with a large internal diameter and is available in various lengths. The stent is designed to be pre-mounted on the 18 Fr Delivery System with a recapture and reposition option at up to 50% deployment.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Ultraflex Esophageal Stent System has a single-strand nitinol construction designed to exert constant, gentle radial pressure, and minimize traumatic tissue compression. The polyurethane covering provides a barrier to resist tumor ingrowth.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The flexible knitted loop design of the Ultraflex nitinol stent and a user-friendly delivery system are features that gastroenterologists are very keen about,” says Alexandra Rousseau, global product manager of esophageal and TB stents for Boston Scientific Microvasive Endoscopy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another company involved in the development of esophageal stents is Wilson-Cook Medical GI Endoscopy. The company’s line of Z-stents is also coated with a polyethylene film and are designed in a double flare configuration. Central fixation barbs facilitate stabilization within the esophagus. The inner diameter of the stent is 16mm.
         </p>
         <p>
          Greg Skerven, vice president of product development for Wilson-Cook, says the company’s products include features that help prevent stent migration after placement.
         </p>
         <p>
          “There is a flange on [each end of the stent] that is larger than the body of the stent,” he says. “When it expands, it is pressing out on the tumor. It is funnel shaped so that keeps it from moving downward and upward.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Wilson-Cook recently collaborated with Kulwinder S. Dua, MD, of the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Froedtert and Medical College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the development of an esophageal anti-reflux stent created specifically for tumors in the lower esophageal, gastroesophageal (GE) junction area.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dua says cancers in this location make up the majority of the approximately 12,000 new cases of esophageal cancer diagnosed each year. When a stent partially bridges the GE junction, the stomach, and the esophagus essentially become a common cavity. Dua says patients run the risk of drowning in their own food when they lie down.
         </p>
         <p>
          “People have reported a reflux disease resulting from a stent placed across the GE junction in anywhere from 20 to 70% of instances. Many have also reported aspiration and death from stents across the GE junction,” Dua says.
         </p>
         <p>
          The idea Dua decided to market through Wilson-Cook was a valve that could be incorporated into an expandable stent to prevent food from backing into the esophagus. The valve is pressure sensitive, allowing patients to belch or vomit when necessary. The gastric pressure actually flips the valve inward, while two swallows of water restore the valve to its original position.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dua emphasizes the importance of keeping current with deployment techniques.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The worst thing that can happen is when doctors who have put in hardly any stents suddenly want to put a stent in a complicated case with an anti-reflux valve that has a unique delivery system, and they run into problems,” he adds.
         </p>

          Dua says ease of placement and a user-friendly delivery system are some of the most important criteria to consider when choosing an esophageal stent. He also said it is a common misconception in the medical field that one size or shape fits all. Certain tumors will necessitate a stent with a high radial force that will not buckle easily. In patients who have received chemotherapy or other combinations of treatment that can soften the esophageal wall, however, a strong radial force could lead to perforation.

          Other treatment options for esophageal cancer include: various combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy, and endoscopic therapy. The disease is rarely curable, with the overall 5-year survival rate in those cases amenable to surgery ranging from 5 to 20%.

          While early detection leads to a better chance of survival, tumors confined to esophageal mucosa or submucosa are usually detected by chance.

          The two most common types of esophageal cancer are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell or epidermoid carcinoma. Most patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus first have Barrett’s esophagus, a condition resulting from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and reflux esophagitus.

          Palliative treatments of malignant dysphagia include: peroral dilation, thermal laser, photodynamic laser, chemical ablation, and the placement of stents. Palliative methods are required by a patient and are the most important contributions to care, considering curing esophageal cancer is rare.

           Nursing Shortage Fuels Concerns About Compromised Care, Patient Outcomes
          </a>

          As the nursing shortage continues, healthcare professionals who work in infection control are keeping a nervous eye on hospital-acquired infections that may be linked to decreased staffing levels. While the employment of nurses is expected to grow much faster than average for all occupations through the year 2008, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, more nurses are leaving the field than entering it. As many as 450,000 nurses may be needed in the next decade, according to government projections.
         </p>
         <p>
          RNs Brenda Nevidjon and Jeanette Ives Erickson, in their paper “The Nursing Shortage: Solutions for the Short and Long Term,” state that the aging of nurses, as well as changes in patient-care models, and shortages in ancillary professions and support labor, are factors that exacerbate the nursing shortage and can aggravate patient outcomes. They point to a study published in Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) that predicted approximately 40% of nurses will be 50 years old or older by the year 2010. Additionally, the average age of a full-time nursing faculty is 49 years old, and one-third of the nursing workforce is already 50 years old. Nevidjon and Erickson say the physical demands of the profession have taxed older nurses, and that hospitals should accommodate them through increased flexibility in scheduling, offering increased time off, and utilizing technology to lighten their workloads.
         </p>
         <p>
          “A survey of nurses conducted by the University of Pennsylvania Department of Nursing revealed nurses were concerned about the perceived diminishment of patient care, and they didn’t believe patients were being given the same level of care as in the past,” says Carolyn Williams, president of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN). “We need to fix that because while (the nursing shortage) is bad in some places, it’s likely to get much worse. More people than ever need care and we simply don’t have adequate numbers of people entering nursing.”
         </p>
         <p>
          A factor in the nursing shortage is the decreased number of individuals entering the profession in the first place. The AACN reports that enrollment of nursing students in entry-level bachelor’s degree programs fell by more than 2% last year, while master’s degree enrollments declined by almost 1%. This decline, while smaller than last year’s figures (declines of 4.6% and 1.9%, respectively), comes even as demand for nurses accelerates in hospitals and surgicenters.
         </p>
         <p>
          Exacerbating the problem is the bad reputation the nursing profession gets– the result of a negative image of nursing as a low-paying, back-breaking occupation. Many potential nursing students may still see nurses as having a lower status than doctors, and many more are wary of entering the field due to still feeling the repercussions of the nursing staff consolidations of the 1990s.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Image is an issue,” Williams admits. “As a group, nurses are not as well educated as many of us would like them to be, with a minimum of a baccalaureate degree. With such varying ranges of educational requirements, nursing sometimes is not seen as a demanding field. It doesn’t draw from the pool of talent other fields do. People will say, ‘My parents expect me to do better than nursing.’ It’s a perception that hurts our profession,” she said. “What nurses really want to do is be able to do a good job, and it upsets them if they can’t. Yes, it would be nice to have more money or benefits or flexible scheduling to avoid burnout, but it’s often about wanting more respect, too. We hear a lot about verbal abuse of nurses by physicians who act in an unprofessional manner, which is unconscionable.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Williams adds nurses need personal and professional autonomy. “Nurses want control over their lives. They want to work in hospitals that have a strong nursing presence; they want an office of nursing affairs to represent them and their issues; they want to participate in nursing decisions, and they want to be respected by other staff members. Nurses get waylaid with things that don’t relate to nursing and then they don’t feel very satisfied if they are not doing things for patients that they ought to be doing. They are tired, disgruntled, then add things like being asked to do too much overtime, and it just adds up and pretty soon they walk.”
         </p>
         <p>
          While hospital administrators dangle incentives like sign-on bonuses and premium packages in front of prospective recruits and hope they can swell their nursing ranks, Nevidjon and Erickson say more pro-active solutions are essential because these kinds of economic strategies simply redistribute the supply of nurses, not increase it. Their suggested solutions include encouraging healthcare organizations to work together to elevate the image of nursing; reaching new pools of nursing talent through improved recruiting techniques; identifying what benefits keep nurses in the profession; and encouraging hospitals to provide intensive training programs for nurses in specialized areas of care, among other strategies.
         </p>
         <p>
          One bright spot, according to Williams, is the fact that many nursing specialties, like infection control, are better staffed because of the opportunity to develop a more advanced body of knowledge and ability.
         </p>
         <p align="center">
          “I honestly think specialties may be in better shape than general staff nursing,” she says. “I know there are some infection control nurses who learn on the job, while others are certified, and I think individuals who can gain educational credentials and recognition for their specialty helps keep them on the job. Nurses want to be thought of as professionals, so specialties can be attractive.”

          Endoscopy is one specialty that is rapidly gaining recruits because of the prestige often associated with it, according to Dr. Michael B. Kimmey, past president of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), the 60-year-old professional organization dedicated to advancing the practice of endoscopy.
         </p>
         <p>
          “There is certainly a nursing shortage overall, but I think we don’t have a problem finding GI nurses because it’s such a great field,” Kimmey says. “It’s an attractive job with more normal hours of 8 to 5, and weekend call is minimal. Plus, GI nurses get to do more technical-oriented things, like manipulating a guidewire, than what they would normally do, yet they are still an integral part of patient care. This experience not only makes a difference in treatment, it extends their nursing skills.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Kimmey reports that many ICU nurses have been joining endoscopy suites nationally.
         </p>
         <p>
          “ICU nurses like endoscopy because they see this as a great lifestyle as well as a way to use their skills,” Kimmey adds. “Endoscopy is a marvelous field–it has so many possibilities. It’s an extension of the trend toward more non-invasive or less-invasive treatment modalities,” he said.
         </p>
         <p>
          “We’re going to be using endoscopes to treat many things surgeons have traditionally treated by open procedures, which is much better for patients in terms of quicker recovery. We’re just beginning to scratch the surface of what we can do. GI nurses are challenged by the knowledge and abilities required of them.”
         </p>
         <p>
          One such area of challenge is sedation, according to Kimmey. “I would like to see GI nurses trained specifically to administer to and monitor patients who are receiving deep sedation with propofal. It’s a new and emerging way to make people sleepy and get them in and out of the hospital or procedure unit quickly. I think having a nurse involved would be a bridge between GI nurses and CRNAs, that’s where I’d like to see the nursing area develop.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Kimmey says that endoscopy requires advanced knowledge on the part of nurses, and that since most departments do not recruit new nursing school graduates, the nursing shortage hasn’t impacted the field greatly.
         </p>
         <p>
          “GI nurses need to be already proficient in general nursing skills, like monitoring patients,” Kimmey says. “Before they take on the additional training required to be a GI nurse they have to have pretty good basics, so we’re not looking for new graduates. We want experienced nurses, and my own view is that ICU nurses are ideal people to recruit to GI,” he said. “The acuity of our patients, many of whom have had GI bleeding, can be significant, and they require special monitoring. I think we have to ask that much more from our nurses trained in GI than general nurses. Having someone with ICU-type skills is the ideal GI nurse.”
         </p>
         <p>
          No matter if it’s ICU or endoscopy, infection control is one practice that unites all specialties within the healthcare facility. As hospitals cope with an acute shortage of nurses, ICPs fret about the potential breakdown in the adherence to universal precautions and the threat of compromising patient outcomes.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Shortage of staff means that whatever staff you do have is worked harder and longer, says Pat Tydell, RN, MSN, MPH, and risk manager at North Chicago Veterans Administration Medical Center in North Chicago, Ill. “This results in fatigue and loss of mental acuity. Errors occur when this happens to people. These errors are those of decreased vigilance to patients’ signs and symptoms, they are more easily distracted, and they have decreased coordination in performing manual tasks. Needlestick injuries could increase, as sleepy nurses lack the fine motor coordination to perform skills such as injections or starting IVs.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Specific IC practices may be curtailed when HCWs feel pressured to perform their duties swiftly due to staffing shortages on the floor. “Shortages mean that everyone is pressed for time and they tend to rush through tasks,” Tydell adds. “People take shortcuts that are not always safe, like wearing gloves for too long, or not washing their hands between patients.”
         </p>
         <p>
          A recent study, “Nurse Staffing and Patient Outcomes in Hospitals,” conducted by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 799 hospitals in 11 states revealed that facilities with adequate staffing are likely to have lower rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections among patients.
         </p>
         <p>
          The report stated that by increasing the number of nurses, healthcare facilities could reduce their UTI rate by up to 25%, and reduce their pneumonia rate up to 17%. The study, directed by Jack Needleman, PhD and assistant professor of economics and health policy at Harvard School of Public Health, found that the total amount of daily nursing time per patient averaged 11.4 hours, with approximately 7.8 hours of RN time, 2.4 hours of aide time, and 1.2 hours of LPN time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Patient outcomes also can be affected by hospitals’ environmental practices, as many HCWs must act beyond their normal realm of responsibilities during a staffing shortage.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Healthcare staffing shortages in general means that whoever is left on the unit is doing more than his or her primary job,” says Tydell. “They may have to empty the trash or clean an item, and not being specialized in the hospital’s housekeeping policies may mean less than optimal cleanliness.”
         </p>
         <p>
          She says that nursing personnel who float have similar challenges. “Nurses who are floated to other units where they may not be familiar with the special requirements of that unit, and there may be little to no time or staff to provide them with an orientation.”
         </p>
         <p>
          One solution to nursing shortages in the past was the use of unlicensed personnel for cost-cutting purposes; however, the fear of medical errors in the face of increasing patient acuities pose great concern for hospital administrators and medical staff alike. “Many hospitals are using nonprofessional persons to take over some aspects of care while still requiring the nurse to supervise that individual. This could lead to breaks in technique the nurse may not know about,” Tydell says.
         </p>
         <p>
          The AACN’s Williams agrees. “Continuity of staffing as it relates to patient care is very important in areas such as infection control,” she says. “Lapses in policies and procedures happen when nurses are rushed or forced to work overtime, and that could put everyone at risk.”

           Editor’s note: The following article highlights companies and the new technologies that they are developing for endoscopy. With video imaging improving rapidly, endoscopy suites are expected to provide the most efficient service. Better photos equal better care. Is your suite up to date?
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          Companies often expand after figuring out how to improve other markets. In the case of Fujinon, company officials helped create a market.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 1944, the Fuji Optical Co., Ltd was established to develop optical instruments to accompany the film already produced by Fuji Photo Film Group. The company’s scientists knew how to make a high quality film, but they wanted to meet this technology with an improved camera and other optical instruments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some 50 years later, this innovative spirit has helped push the company to the forefront of endoscope manufacturing.
         </p>
         <p>
          In April, 1971, Fujinon developed and commercialized its first endoscope. Within the past 30 years, Fujinon’s products and systems have gone through a world of development.
         </p>
         <p>
          In May, 1985, the company showcased one of the first video endoscopes at the Digestive Disease Week conference and in May, 1989, they released a super image video endoscope at the Gastroenterological Endoscopy Show in Japan.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today, they offer one of the highest pixel counts available in endoscopes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Their products have gone from basic rigid scopes to the …400 series endoscopy systems that include a scope, light source, and processor. Other new Fujinon products include the EG-250HR gastroscope. The outer diameter of the instrument has been reduced to 9.4mm. The forcep channel diameter is 2.8mm. The smaller diameters make patients more comfortable and let the endoscopy team spend more time concentrating on the procedure, rather than the nervousness of its patient.
         </p>
         <p>
          The EG-250PE also is new on the market. The pediatric video-gastroscope has a variety of applications and has a flexible portion diameter of 8.1mm.
         </p>
         <p>
          The company is also promoting its new maintenance and repairs guarantee offered with each new …200 or …400 series endoscopic systems. When a healthcare center buys, leases, or acquires (on a cost-per-procedure basis) one of the systems, the company will now include a “Full Circle Commitment” on each product. This includes a complete inspection, preventive maintenance, and routine repairs. Each scope will have an A-rubber exchange, nozzle replacement, angulation adjustment, and an outgoing quality assurance inspection twice a year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each service also includes a loaner scope so healthcare centers do not have to worry about rescheduling appointments. Shipping will be paid by the company as well to make sure both scopes are delivered on time. Also, when the company has a representative available, light source and processor service is also available on site.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no charge for this program.
         </p>
         <p>
          The difference between the …200 and …400 systems is a matter of technology. The …200 series is designed for ambulatory and outpatient surgical centers. The models feature 410,000-pixel charge coupled devices (CCDs) and produce analog images. The scopes use the same combined light source and video processor. These instruments will work with all previous, current, and future endoscopes within the series under the company’s modular system integration program.
         </p>
         <p>
          The …400 series is the highest end of endoscopes on the market. They produce digital images with 410,000-pixel CCDs. They have 35X optical zooms and let the endoscopy team fill the monitor with any minute feature they want to examine more closely. The light source used with this system is xenon and the backup light is halogen. The video processor also has features to control image capture. The system also has a microprocessor for patient scheduling, image storage, and presetting individual control preferences for each endoscopist.
         </p>
         <p>
          This series also contains a group of scopes with twice the pixel count as any other scope in the world. These 850,000-pixel CCD endoscopes are usually used in teaching and research institutions.
         </p>
         <p>
          The same program applies for the …400 series as well. All past-present-future equipment will be compatible with each other.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each series has a variety of scopes available including: bronchoscopes, gastroscopes, duodenoscopes, colonoscopes, sigmoidoscopes, and laparoscopes.
         </p>
         <p>
          The systems range in price from $12,000 to $24,000.
         </p>
         <p>
          The vice president of Fujinon, Eric Knisley, says these scopes will help the overall health of patients by giving endoscopists the power to more closely examine their patients, with the technology of seeing the images clearly, and being able to store them for later reference.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The increased resolution achieve by the new … series scopes can easily change endoscopic outcomes for practicing endoscopists. Improved image quality and resolution significantly enhance diagnostic yields, which provide much earlier detection of previously unseen abnormalities. These results clearly improve patient management and ultimately reduce healthcare costs,” he said.

          Olympus America, distributor manufacturer of optical instruments, has introduced a new endoscope that features variable stiffness to meet the anatomy and physical conditions of the patient.
         </p>
         <p>
          Innoflex™, the world’s first variable stiffness colonoscope, adapts to the contours of the colon for precise insertion. The colonoscope is part of the Olympus EVIS EXERA™ system and has been heralded as a crucial instrument for the treatment of the aging baby boomer population. With colorectal cancer rates increasing and the pool of retired Americans quickly growing, innovation in the area of colonoscopes is necessary.
         </p>
         <p>
          Also, the difficulty most physicians and endoscopy teams report concerning colonoscopy is that the characteristics and anatomy of a patient’s colon are not known before the procedure. An endoscope needed to be developed to be able to function for patients with varying anatomies and gastroenterological health issues.
         </p>
         <p>
          Olympus engineers developed a scope with a variable stiffness feature to tackle these problems.
         </p>
         <p>
          In an article from the Journal of the British Society of Gastroenterology (GUT) featured a recent study of 100 patients and the variable stiffness colonoscope. Of 100 cases, 43 were performed with a conventional colonoscope (Olympus CF200HL) and 57 were performed with the new variable stiffness colonoscope. There were four incomplete examinations with the first group (two sigmoid fixations, two benign strictures). There were also two incomplete procedures with the second group (one cancerous obstruction, one fixed sigmoid). All but one of these patients were able to use a pediatric scope instead.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of those patients who received the variable stiffness scope, the intubation time was quicker by more than four minutes in comparison to the other group using a traditional colonoscope. The pain scores with the variable stiffness group were also less. They had a median pain rate of seven in comparison to the traditional group’s rate of 24.
         </p>
         <p>
          From this study, the researchers concluded that the variable stiffness colonoscope improved the performance of the procedure by reducing intubation time and discomfort.
         </p>
         <p>
          Olympus officials report the scope works by letting the gastroenterologist or the physican adjust a knob for tube flexibility. The knob, which is located below the control section, can be adjusted in continuous increments to match the internal conditions and contours of the colon. The cecum can be reached more easily in cases where insertion is difficult and there is a reduced need for abdominal pressure and position change.
         </p>
         <p>
          The scope also has an extra-wide 140º field of view and extensive 4-way angulation (180º up/down and 160º right/left) to enable complete examination of the colon and the grip of the scope has been designed with ergonomics in mind. The insertion tube is actually able to change stiffness levels because of a built-in coil. This decreases the chance of looping and makes insertion beyond the splenic flexure easier, while reportedly reducing the need for abdominal pressure on the sigmoid looping.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ken Wolcott, senior product manager from Olympus America said physician response to the new technology has been positive.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Throughout the world, physician response to the Innoflex has been overwhelming. We continually hear success stories from physicians who have decreased their time to reach the cecum and sales of the variable stiffness models have now exceeded sales of conventional colonoscopes,” he said.

          Image management was first introduced by Pentax in 1987, allowing findings observed during an endoscopy procedure to be captured as still images. These subsequently can be reviewed, shared, and indexed in a computer database. Today, Pentax offers endoscopy suites the next level of image management in motion picture studio technology (MPS), more commonly known as video streaming. This capability goes beyond still images, offering motion video documentation, which can be saved and recalled using a computer. MPS can record an entire procedure and create video highlight summaries with the touch of a button. Image indexing, annotation, and video editing are just some of the capabilities this new tool presents.

          systems, users can print and view patient information and schedules as well as capture and store still images and video clips. This eases records management, and facilitates the transfer of information between physicians and staff while increasing both workflow and productivity. Whether in a one-room clinic, or a multi-room endoscopy suite, MPS can be used to effectively link data between users and workstations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Not only does video streaming facilitate better practice management, but it can provide significant clinical advantage as well. It is often difficult to determine size of strictures and lesions when viewing endoscopic images through a scope, due to the distortions that take place during angling. However, with video streaming, a 30-second motion picture sequence allows for points of reference to be established, reviewed, and compared for as long as the records are kept. Moreover, these images can be shared between referring physicians to further continuity of care.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to its usefulness in examining and resecting tumors and biopsies, it provides a myriad of applications for medical academia. Specific images can be marked for recall, annotated with notes for teaching, indexed for convenience, and then reproduced for utilization in academic presentations and publications.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another distinct advantage to this technology is that since information is stored digitally, indexing and transmission of data throughout networks and over the Internet become immediately possible.

          The quality of the endoscopic images provided through video streaming is impressive. Hayk Esenyan, director of new technologies at Pentax comments, “The ability to perceive high quality, temporal characteristics of an endoscopic subject through video streaming carries great advantage both during procedures and in later review. In addition, the endoscopic information captured in video streaming is more comprehensive than that obtained through prior technologies. The image quality is sharper and the information obtained is more representative of the procedure as a whole.”

           ERCP and Gallstone Removal

          Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is often considered one of the most technically challenging procedures for an endoscopy nurse. The procedure, which involves passing an endoscope through the mouth, down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the duodenum, allows doctors to diagnose and remove gallstones in the bile duct in a single procedure. It is simultaneously diagnostic and therapeutic.
         </p>
         <p>
          While the procedure is often required following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, this is not always the case. If a patient has gallstones in the gallbladder, he or she will often have them in the common duct, but it is also possible that there are stones in the duct and none in the gallbladder. In these instances, ERCP will be the first therapeutic procedure required.
         </p>
         <p>
          Because of the level of expertise involved in ERCP and the wide range of equipment options, understanding the procedure and which instruments to use in a given situation is crucial. This is particularly important considering ERCP has a high instance of complications compared to other endoscopic procedures, including pancreatitis, bleeding, infection, and perforation.
         </p>
         <p>
          While the role of the nurse in an ERCP varies by location, Jeff Barnett, MD, associate director of the Medical Procedures Unit at the University of Michigan, says all nurses should have an understanding of the procedure beyond simply monitoring the patient and handling instruments.
         </p>
         <p>
          “A one-on-one relationship [between the doctor and the nurse] is possibly more important with ERCP than with any other endoscopic procedure,” Barnett says. “The doctor and the nurse really have to learn to work together. A lot of doctors want a nurse to work with them who is really experienced with the procedure.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Most nurses are not exposed to ERCP on a regular basis, which can make gaining proficiency a challenge. Tammy Muncrief, an RN at Citizen’s Medical Center in Victoria, Texas, says even though a nurse is constantly under a doctor’s direction, he or she needs to have a firm knowledge of the instruments.
         </p>
         <p>
          “ERCP is probably the hardest procedure for a nurse to learn and actually feel comfortable with, mainly because you have them few and far between, so you don’t become familiar with them as quickly,” she says. “You have to have an overview of everything to be able to do it. You can’t be good in one area and bad in another.”
         </p>
         <p>
          At Citizen’s Medical Center, a team of three nurses assists the doctor performing the ERCP. Typically one of the three is responsible for the instruments. It is this nurse’s job to assist in instrument selection, ensure instruments are in working order and assist in manipulation of instruments such as guide wires and cannulas.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Instruments
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Once the gallstones have been identified, doctors will typically elect to either capture the stones using a basket, or push the stones down into the duodenum with a retrieval, or occlusion, balloon.
         </p>
         <p>
          Baskets are available in a number of different shapes and sizes. Mike Mangano, global product manager for pancreatic biliary instruments at Boston Scientific, says the four-wire basket is the most common, but facilities will have a variety of sizes and styles available. When selecting an instrument, Mangano says a number of factors are important to consider, including the size of the stone, its location within the duct, dilation of the duct, the patient’s anatomy, and the doctor’s preference.
         </p>
         <p>
          Muncrief says nurses at Citizen’s Medical Center keep at least two of each size of instrument on hand. Anything that is used during ERCP is circled on the instrument chart and replaced immediately following the procedure. When choosing instruments, Muncrief says the nurses typically look for anything that makes the procedure easier and faster, so the patient does not need to be sedated any longer than necessary.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mangano says nurses need to make themselves specialists, spending more time understanding the instruments and how they are used in the procedure.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Most nurses just go and get [an instrument] instead of understanding why that device is being used,” he says. “They need to understand the mechanics, the anatomy, and the devices themselves and how the devices specifically function. That is probably the most important part for an ERCP nurse.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Advancements are always in the workings when it comes to ERCP equipment. Mangano says baskets and occlusion balloons improve every year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Muncrief says the most recent ERCP advancement at her endoscopy unit is the use of rapid exchange, which locks the guide wire into place. Companies are continually looking for ways to simplify the procedure through instrumentation, she adds, as it is fairly difficult to perform.
         </p>
         <p>
          A number of developments have been made recently in mechanical lithotriptors used to crush stones, according to Barnett. A few institutions are also working with shock wave catheters that fit through the scope and can be used to pulverize the stones in the bile duct.
         </p>
         <p>
          Researchers are currently looking at the possibility of combining ERCP and endoscopic ultrasound. Barnett says the ultrasound would allow doctors to locate the stone without injecting dye, which he says can increase the risk of pancreatitis. ERCP would then be used to retrieve the stone. He expects it will be at least 5 years before this becomes common practice.
         </p>
         <p>
          Whenever a new instrument is introduced in a facility, Muncreif says representatives from the medical instrument company will provide presentations and make themselves available to medical staff as cases arise until all are comfortable with the device. Nurses new to ERCP observe several procedures before participating, and Muncrief says two endoscopy RNs are required to be present for all ERCPs.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nurses interested in becoming proficient in ERCP should focus on both the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, as it is counterproductive to understand one and not the other.
         </p>
         <p>
          Overall, ERCP is often considered a safe and successful procedure for diagnosing and treating problems in the bile and pancreatic ducts and, in many cases, is completed without complication. Perhaps the biggest benefit is that patients who undergo therapeutic ERCP avoid the need for major abdominal surgery. Nurses taking an active role in furthering their knowledge of the equipment associated with ERCP will help lower the instance of complication and promote a complementary relationship between doctors and nurses for this challenging procedure

          bronchoscopy is the endoscopic direct examination and visualization of the trachea and the tracheobronchial tree. Using a fiberoptic bronchoscope (a slender flexible tube with a light on the distal end) structures and abnormalities can be located and identified.

          Bronchoscopy was developed for the removal of foreign bodies in 1895 in Freiburg, Germany. Gustav Killian succeeded in the removal of a piece of bone from the right mainstem bronchus of a 36-year-old man. Since then, Chevlier Jackson wrote a textbook on endoscopy, Shigeto Ikeda introduced flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy for clinical use in 1968 and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy became available in the United States in 1972. Bronchoscopy has made a dramatic impact on the approach and management of the pulmonary patient.

          A standard flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope consists of a proximal control section with a distal light source attachment connected by a flexible insertion tube. The outer diameter is approximately 4.8 mm to 5.9 mm. The control section has an eyepiece at its most proximal end and an angle lever that allows distal end to flex up and down. There is an inner channel for instillation or aspiration of liquids or insertion of cytology brushes, needles or biopsy forceps.

For focal infiltrates on the chest X-ray, the segmental bronchus chosen for BAL should be in the area of new or progressive radiologic abnormalities. A BAL is commonly done in patients with diffuse infiltrates, cavitary lesions or suspected chemical injury. A lavage done in the right middle lobe or lingula can yield up to 20 times more fluid when compared to the lower lobes. The tip of the fiberoptic bronchoscope is wedged into a bronchial segment. Five aliquots of 25 cc of sterile normal saline is placed into the specified bronchial segment, then withdrawn immediately. The fluid is sent to the laboratory for viral, bacterial and fungal cultures and cytology.
         </p>
         <p>
          Endobronchial forceps biopsy: This procedure is used for visual lesions and lesions that can only be seen with a fluoroscope. Small nodules, diffuse infiltrates and toxic injury can be biopsied. Biopsy forceps are used to obtain pieces of the bronchial mucosa, bronchial wall, lung parenchyma or lesions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Transbronchial biopsy: Biopsy forceps are advanced through the fiberoptic bronchoscope using fluoroscopy and several lung tissue samples are obtained.
         </p>
         <p>
          No special forceps are designed for endobronchial or transbronchial forceps biopsy. Two main types of forceps are the cup forceps (without teeth) and the alligator forceps (saw-toothed). It has been noted that the alligator forcep is being used less because the tearing action of the forcep has been associated with hemorrhage.
         </p>
         <p>
          Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA): Extends the diagnostic capabilities of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope by allowing the retrieval of specimens beyond the confines of the tracheobronchial mucosa.
         </p>
         <p>
          A (Wang) transbronchial needle is inserted through the working channel of the fiberoptic bronchoscope into a segment of lung tissue with a noted abnormality. The needle aspirates material from masses and/or enlarged lymph nodes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once removed from the bronchoscope, the needle is used to expel a sample of the aspirated material onto a glass slide. Placing the two slides together and pulling them apart make a mirror image smear. One slide is immediately stained (diff quick) and evaluated for diagnostic adequacy. The second slide is taken to the cytology lab for additional staining. The transbronchial needle is flushed and the rinse (specimen) is processed by a concentration technique for later staining and evaluation.

           In The Procedure Room
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          When the patient arrives in the procedure room, the endoscopy nurse will:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Review patient’s chart for informed consent.
          </li>
          <li>
           Assess compliance with NPO requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
           Review chart and ask patient about known allergies.
          </li>
          <li>
           Place patient on cardiac monitor, automatic blood pressure cuff and oxygen saturation monitor.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          An initial baseline patient assessment is completed and documented.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Final Preparations Before the Bronchoscopy Procedure
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Nebulized lidocaine: Nebulized lidocaine is one of the most effective methods to anesthetize the upper airway. The 5 cc of 4-percent lidocaine (200 mg) is placed in a nebulizer and the patient is instructed to breath deeply. Nebulization of lidocaine takes approximately 20 minutes. Once completed the patient is placed in a supine position.
         </p>
         <p>
          Oxygenation: Oxygenation throughout the entire bronchoscopy is extremely important. The patient’s oxygen flow rate will be adjusted based on the patient’s pulse oximetry. It should not drop below 90 percent.
         </p>
         <p>
          The suction port of the fiberoptic bronchoscope can aspirate up to 14 liters of oxygen, stealing not only administered oxygen, but alveolar oxygen. Suctioning-induced hypoxia can be diminished by the bronchoscopist limiting suctioning for brief periods.
          <sup>
           7
          </sup>
         </p>
         <p>
          Viscous lidocaine: The pulmonologist applies 2-percent viscous lidocaine to the maximal nasal aperture with a cotton-tipped applicator to minimize discomfort during insertion of the bronchoscope. Typically the left naris is noted to be larger than the right.
         </p>
         <p>
          Intravenous conscious sedation: The pulmonary clinical nurse gives intravenous (IV) conscious sedation to the patient when the pulmonologist is ready to begin. The goals of IV conscious sedation include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Maintenance of spontaneous respirations.
          </li>
          <li>
           Adequate oxygenation.
          </li>
          <li>
           Patient ability to inspire and expire on command (deep breaths help align the vocal cords, larynx and fiberoptic bronchoscope).
          </li>
          <li>
           An amnesic effect to help decrease the patients psychological stressors and increase cooperation.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Regardless of the type of IV sedation used, small doses should be administered until patient is sedated, yet able to follow instructions and demonstrate reflex responsiveness.
          <sup>
           8
          </sup>
          The interval between repeated doses should be at least the maximum onset time of the drug. Repeated dosing may cause the patient to become uncooperative or oversedated and may lead to respiratory and/or cardiac arrest.
         </p>
         <p>
          An emergency resuscitation cart appropriate to the patient’s age should be readily available in the bronchoscopy room.
         </p>
         <p>
          If the patient decompensates during the bronchoscopy, the pulmonologist will maintain ventilation with the assistance of an Ambu bag or may intubate the patient with an endotracheal tube.
         </p>
         <p>
          IV conscious sedated patients are at risk for oversedation.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           The Bronchoscopy Begins
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          With the patient adequately sedated, the insertion of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy begins with the examination of the nasal fossa, nasal pharynx and larynx. The transnasal approach to bronchoscopy is better tolerated by the patient and allows for better leverage of the scope. The anatomy and mobility of the vocal cords are evaluated visually as the patient verbalizes an “e” sound and the entire circumference of the trachea is viewed.
         </p>
         <p>
          The fiberoptic bronchoscope is passed to the carina, which is examined for sharpness, position and texture. The bronchial orifice is systematically identified, evaluated and suctioned free of secretions and close attention is paid to color, texture, position size and patency.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Post-Bronchoscopy Laboratory Standards
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          The pulmonologist sends all specimens to the laboratory. Patients who are not immunosuppressed will have microbiology specimens sent to the laboratory. Immunosuppressed patients (transplant, cancer and HIV patients) will have bronchoscopy specimens sent for microbiology and virology. Cytology specimens are sent for cancer, viral changes and fungal elements.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           The following are the standard microbiology specimens sent:

           After the Bronchoscopy
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          When the examination is complete, the patient is placed into a Fowler’s position. Close monitoring of the patient’s oxygen saturation, vital signs and level of consciousness are documented every five minutes. When oxygen saturations are greater than 92 percent, the patient is weaned off the oxygen therapy.
         </p>
         <p>
          The patient is monitored in the procedure room for approximately 30 minutes past the last dose of IV sedation. When the patient has returned to his or her assessment, the pulmonary clinical nurse updates the receiving floor nurse.
         </p>
         <p>
          Special procedure and nurses notes, the fiberoptic bronchoscopy report and the post-bronchoscopy order sheet are placed in the patient’s chart and the patient is transported to his or her unit.
         </p>
         <p>
          If transbronchial biopsies were performed, the patient needs a chest X-ray before returning to his or her floor. The pulmonologist reads the chest X-ray and notifies the medical team with any problems.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           The Patient Returns
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          The post-bronchoscopy order sheet specifies NPO status, vital sign frequency, oxygen delivery and the contact number for the pulmonologist.
         </p>
         <p>
          The patient must remain NPO for a minimum of one hour after the bronchoscopy due to the lidocaine inhibiting gag reflex. Vital signs and pulse oximetry are monitored q 1 hour X 2, then q 4 hours X 2. Notify the pulmonologist for any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain or hemoptysis. Some hemoptysis may be expected if biopsies were obtained.
         </p>
         <p>
          The patient should be placed on fall precautions post-bronchoscopy due to the IV sedation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Fever of up to 101 degrees Fahrenheit.can be expected after a bronchoscopy. Although anticipated, it should be reported to the pulmonologist for evaluation. A transplant patient with a temperature greater than 99.6 F should be reported to the pulmonologist or the transplant physician for evaluation.

           Outpatient Bronchoscopy
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          An outpatient bronchoscopy is slightly different than an inpatient bronchoscopy. The pulmonologist identifies that a patient needs a bronchoscopy. The pulmonary clinical nurse contacts the patient and family to:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Obtain patient information and schedule the bronchoscopy.
          </li>
          <li>
           Give the patient and family instructions on dietary restrictions.
          </li>
          <li>
           Inform the patient and family that the patient cannot drive after a bronchoscopy procedure. Arrangements for transportation need to be made in advance.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          After consultation with the physician, the nurse tells the patients who take Coumadin® to stop their prescription for approximately three to four days prior to the bronchoscopy. Patients who stop their Coumadin may experience a medical risk and special arrangements are made for them. Aspirin should be held for several days before the procedure as well. A prothrombin time (PT) should be checked prior to the procedure.
         </p>
         <p>
          The patient is instructed to arrive at the hospital one hour before the bronchoscopy.
         </p>
         <p>
          After checking with the clerk in the outpatient area, the patient comes to the pulmonary diagnostic laboratory where the pulmonologist reviews the procedure with the patient and family and obtains informed consent. Physician orders are completed and placed in the chart.
         </p>
         <p>
          The pulmonary clinical nurse starts a peripheral IV line. The patient is given the 4-percent 5 cc lidocaine nebulizer. The recovery period is approximately 30-60 minutes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Before Discharge:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           IV will be removed.
          </li>
          <li>
           Discharge instructions will be reviewed with patient and family.
          </li>
          <li>
           Written instructions are provided since the medications used for conscious sedation may cause difficulty in remembering instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
           If the patient requires a post-procedure chest X-ray, he or she is escorted to radiology to wait for the pulmonologist to read the X-ray before final discharge.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          All of the outpatient’s records from the bronchoscopy are sent immediately to medical records for placement in the patient’s chart.

           Potential Complications and Risks
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Hypoxia: Hypoxia is the most common complication of bronchoscopy. Interventions include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Supplemental oxygen is always given during the procedure.
          </li>
          <li>
           Pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, cardiac rhythm and level of consciousness are monitored continuously.
          </li>
          <li>
           Patients with underlying lung disease are monitored closely due to increased risk of complications.
          </li>
          <li>
           The pulmonologist is notified immediately for any and all changes in the patient’s respiratory status. (i.e., dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation, laryngeal stridor, wheezing).
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Drug reaction: Allergies are checked and noted before the procedure. If the patient has never had a medication before, the chance for an allergic reaction exists.
         </p>
         <p>
          Death: Although death is extremely rare during a bronchoscopy, intervention includes:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Emergency resuscitative equipment is readily available in the procedure room.
          </li>
          <li>
           All staff should have conscious sedation training.

           All staff should have advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) training.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Pneumothorax: Interventions include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, vital signs, cardiac rhythm and level of consciousness are monitored continuously.
          </li>
          <li>
           Assess for signs and symptoms of dyspnea.
          </li>
          <li>
           Assess breath sounds in all lung fields.
          </li>
          <li>
           Chest X-ray performed for transbronchial biopsies and transbronchial needle aspirations.
          </li>
          <li>
           Chest tube or a Tru-Close thoracic vent will be inserted for lung re-expansion if necessary.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Infection: Transient fever may occur due to the irritation of the tissue or, rarely, by introduction of a contaminant. Interventions include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Notify the pulmonologist for a temperature greater than 101 F. For transplant patients, notify the physicians of a temperature of greater than 99.6 F.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Irregular heart beat: Vasovagal stimulation can occur as the fiberoptic bronchoscope passes through the vocal cords. Intervention includes:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           The patient is cardiac monitored continuously.
          </li>
          <li>
           Atropine 1 mg is given to prevent a vasovagal response.
          </li>
          <li>
           Emergency equipment should be readily available in the procedure area.
          </li>

          Bleeding: Interventions include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           PT/PTT, CBC and platelet count are obtained before the procedure.
          </li>
          <li>
           Platelets can be given during the bronchoscopy to help control bleeding if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
           The fiberoptic bronchoscope can be placed at the site of bleeding to perform rapid suctioning if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
           Epinephrine can be applied topically via the fiberoptic bronchoscope in order to control the bleeding. Epinephrine 1:1,000 (1 mg/ml) is mixed with 9 cc of normal saline and administered to the site in 1-2 cc aliquots. (Epinephrine is a very potent vasoconstrictor and can increase the heart rate.)
          </li>
          <li>
           The patient can be placed on the a affected side in order to minimize aspiration of blood into the non-affected lung.
          </li>
          <li>
           The patient may be intubated in order to protect the airway with a massive hemoptysis.

          Can you remember why you became a gastrointestinal (GI) nurse? Close your eyes and recall the moment you chose to enter GI nursing. Was it the tales of a respected colleague or friend who was a GI nurse? An opportunity to escape “the floor” or the daily psychic trauma of the emergency room (ER)? Can you remember how excited and thrilled you were your first week in endoscopy, exploring strange new worlds?

         <p>
          I decided to become a gastroenterologist after such a moment as an intern. I assisted in a post-midnight endoscopy on my old veteran patient, a variceal bleeder. After hours at the bedside applying a useless ice-water lavage, I was fascinated by the ease and grace with which the GI fellow stopped the life-threatening bleed with endoscopy.
         </p>
         <p>
          On my return home, I rushed to call my parents about what I had decided to become when I grew up. My mother was perplexed but supportive. Her response to a daughter who would wish to do such a weird, distasteful, unusual profession as endoscopy was, “Honey, as long as it makes your ears wiggle.”
         </p>
         <p>
          It’s been more than a decade and my ears still wiggle when I get a great case or an interesting patient; however, it seems there is a lot of “physician stuff” conspiring against the vibrations of my ears: long hours, heavy patient loads and malpractice concerns.
         </p>
         <p>
          Those in GI nursing have similar problems. I have been privileged to speak with many of you about your profession, and find similar concerns worldwide, including:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Hospital administration’s lack of effort to retain good nurses, as in “any ol” nurse can do GI, can’t they?”
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          One of our local hospitals pays one GI nurse to be on-call nights and weekends. If there is an unruly bleeder or a tough foreign-body extraction in the wee hours, the endonurse gets a nurse covering the operating room (OR) or the nurse administrator to monitor the patient while he or she does the procedure — really untrained care for our sickest patients.
         </p>
         <p>
          At this same hospital, if a weekend or night endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is needed, the GI nurse needs to call on the endo suite, hoping to find someone available to assist in the procedure.
         </p>
         <p>
          What’s wrong with this picture?
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Lack of respect and appreciation and the incivility of doctors.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The rampant incivility of our generation is alive and well in the hospital, where it can have disastrous effects. Poor communication and collaboration have actually been shown to increase death rates for similar patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). If you don’t like your colleagues or physicians, you may not communicate with them fully about a patient. It’s not just an issue of seeking a pleasant workplace, but of the very nature of what we are sworn to do. Our nastiness is harming our patients.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Increased workload with shortened room times for procedures
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Faster, faster, faster … are we taking as much care as we used to?
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Rewarding the incompetence of your less capable colleagues with less work.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          You know who they are.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Difficulty in maintaining competency in new or rare procedures.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          There’s not enough APC, PDT and laser work to go around, and who wants all the late afternoon and evening ERCPs?
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Irregular hours with mandatory overtime and on-call requirements.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Very tough on family life and a strain on many nurses, weird hours in medicine make it tough to fulfill other responsibilities. It has been said that medicine is the only socially acceptable reason to abandon one’s family!
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Lack of professional growth opportunities.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          There is only one unit director, so where do you go from here?
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Occupational risks: infectious, chemical, environmental and radiation exposures.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Although available, many choose not to wear protective devices or to report on-the-job injuries. Rates of wearing gluteraldehyde or radiation badges are low, as are eye protection rates. Protect yourself first!
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Low pay.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Need I explain? All of this is piled up on top of insufficient time to take care of yourself.
         </p>
         <p>
          What is the answer? We need to reconnect with those parts of our profession that thrill us and discard the parts that don’t. We must demand appropriate compensation for our work, via unionization if necessary. We need to seek protection from occupational hazards, and request such protective devices as appropriate. We should support the use of certified endoscopy nurses as nurse endoscopists, rather than underqualified primary-care physicians, nurse practitioners or physicians’ assistants. We will insist that the endoscopy suite become a civil workplace.
         </p>
         <p>
          Most importantly, continue your efforts through your professional affiliation and credentialing to be recognized as certified experts in your field. You are a rare and talented group.

          Heartburn is a burning sensation behind the breast bone when stomach contents reflux backward into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux, GER). GER occurs in 10 percent to 48 percent of the U.S. population. Untreated GER has potentially severe complications including erosive esophagitis, ulcer disease, stricture and Barrett’s esophagus with its increased risk for the development of esophageal cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Current GER treatments include gastric acid blocking drugs and fundoplication surgery. Medications include H2 blockers that control GER symptoms in 60 percent of patients and esophagitis in 50 percent of patients. Proton pump inhibitors are more effective and control GER symptoms in 80 percent of patients and esophagitis in 90 percent of patients. Many patients are challenged, though, by a desire to discontinue these medications, difficulty with long-term medical compliance, persistence of regurgitation symptoms or drug intolerance.
         </p>
         <p>
          Fundoplication surgery is very effective in controlling acid reflux disease, esophagitis, and symptoms of regurgitation. This operation requires the use of general anesthesia and one to two days hospitalization. Post-operative complaints include swallowing difficulties in 4 percent to 31 percent of patients, bloating in 5 percent to 50 percent and excessive flatulence in up to 80 percent of patients.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Stretta procedure is an approved technique for acid reflux disease.
          <sup>
           1
          </sup>
          The Stretta procedure uses radiofrequency electrosurgery delivered to the lower esophageal sphincter and gastric cardia and represents a minimally invasive, endoscopic treatment alternative to drugs or fundoplication surgery. Radiofrequency energy is delivered to tissue via a specially designed catheter used during outpatient endoscopy. The treatment produces vibrating water molecules and heat in the target tissue, which leads to tissue constriction and improved muscle wall thickness. The changes decrease the frequency of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESRs), which are major mechanisms underlying GER. In addition, the Stretta procedure has been demonstrated to increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure, decrease esophageal acid exposure time, decrease the need for acid blocking drugs, and controlling GER symptoms and esophagitis. Significant improvements in physical and mental quality-of-life scores of GER patients have been noted after the Stretta procedure.
         </p>
         <p>
          At the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., the Stretta radiofrequency procedure has been used on selected GER patients since January 2001. Among these were 13 patients with documented acid reflux disease whose patient information and Stretta treatment parameters were subsequently reviewed, including patient age, weight, procedure time, medication requirement and recovery-room time. These patients had a median age of 64 (range: 34 to 75 years old) and a median weight of 83 kg (range: 68 kg to 108 kg). Five of the patients were women and eight were men. Procedure parameters and sedative medication requirements included a median midazolam dose of 10 mg (range: 7 mg to 12 mg) and median meperidine dose 250 mg (range: 150mg to 300 mg). The median length of the Stretta procedure was 51 minutes (range: 42 minutes to 75 minutes) and the median length of the patients’ recovery room stay was 115 minutes (range: 70 minutes to 175 minutes). Complications were limited to transient odynophagia and chest pain. We concluded the Stretta procedure can be safely performed in patients with a wide range of ages. The procedures, however, may be lengthy compared to standard upper endoscopy. Conscious sedation for Stretta patients required higher doses of sedative medication and a longer stay in the recovery room. These factors have led us to schedule Stretta patients in the late morning to avoid disrupting the morning endoscopy schedule while permitting adequate recovery time. Our experience is similar to the results from controlled trials performed with the Stretta procedure. In these studies, post Stretta adverse events were limited to transient fever, dysphagia, chest pain, superficial mucosal injury and anesthesia reactions. There were no new cases of swallowing problems, achalasia or decreased esophageal peristalsis (motility).
         </p>
         <p>
          The Stretta procedure is not recommended for patients with severe GER, large hiatal hernias or a poorly functioning esophagus with dysphagia or stricture. Candidates for the Stretta procedure include patients with a desire to continue GER medications, patients who experience drug intolerance or patients with inadequate symptom response. These patients may consider endoscopic radiofrequency electrosurgery as an alternative to long-term drug therapy or fundoplication.

          Gail Burton, RN, CGRN, is familiar with cancer. Not only has the endoscopy nurse treated numerous patients in her 30 years at Central Baptist Hospital in Lexington, Ky., but she has also seen family members diagnosed.
         </p>
         <p>
          The reality is every American knows someone who has faced cancer. Lost loved ones, celebrities, children, grandparents and many others have died from varying forms of the mysterious killer.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Guidelines for Prevention
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Colon cancer, unlike many other forms, can be detected early and potentially prevented by following specific guidelines. Some 5 percent of all cases of colorectal cancers are caused by genetic mutations. The exceeding majority can be prevented because they are caused by adenomatous polyps. These precancerous tumors grow slowly and can be removed.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Looking at the statistics, there will be more than 100,000 colon cancer diagnoses this year,” Burton says. “Unfortunately 50 percent of those will also die. This is particularly bad because colon cancer is curable with early detection and intervention.”
         </p>
         <p>
          The recommended guidelines also say that all positive tests should be followed up with a colonoscopy and patients with a personal or family history of the disease should begin testing earlier.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The gastroenterologist and the surgeon work hand-in-hand to diagnose the disease in its early stages with surgical intervention,” Burton says. “We have a complete cure in more than 60 percent of patients, but we still need to emphasize early detection. If it isn’t detected early, the cancer can pass through the wall of the colon and affect other organs.”
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Elevated Risk
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          There are conditions that place patients at a heightened risk for developing colon cancer. A family history of the disease is the most prevalent risk. Certain conditions, (i.e., familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) are caused from genetic mutations. These conditions can be diagnosed by a simple genetic test.
         </p>
         <p>
          Officials at the American Cancer Society recommend patients with these conditions be screened for colon cancer earlier and more frequently. FAP patients often have their bowels removed in their twenties to prevent the development of cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          Gardner’s syndrome is also associated with a high risk of developing colon cancer. The condition causes multiple osteomas and soft-tissue tumors of the skin. It is an autosomal dominant trait genetic condition.
         </p>
         <p>
          Characteristics of patients with a hereditary colon cancer condition often include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           At least three relatives with colon cancer
          </li>
          <li>
           Two successive generations with colon cancer
          </li>
          <li>
           One of the family members with colon cancer was younger than 50 when diagnosed
          </li>
          <li>
           At least two people who are diagnosed are first-degree relatives.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          For those patients who have these characteristics, doctors often recommend genetic counseling.
         </p>
         <p>
          Additional groups who are at a heightened risk include Ashkenazi Jews with the I1307K APC genetic mutation. Although they do not develop this cancer when they are young, as with other genetic mutations, patients with this family heritage should be more mindful of screening.
         </p>
         <p>
          The American Cancer Society lists the following risk factors for patients without a family history of the disease.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           A personal history of the disease
          </li>
          <li>
           A personal history of intestinal polyps
          </li>
          <li>
           A personal history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease
          </li>
          <li>
           Aging – More than 90 percent of patients diagnosed are age 50 or older
          </li>
          <li>
           A diet mainly of animal sources
          </li>
          <li>
           Physical inactivity
          </li>
          <li>
           Obesity
          </li>
          <li>
           Smoking
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          “We have found that the primary care physician will evaluate patients for colon cancer through intensive communication with their patient regarding family history of cancer — not just colon cancer,” Burton says. “A variety of other cancers, like ovarian, breast and lung, can increase your chance of developing colon cancer as a secondary area of the disease. The physicians will then refer their patients to either a gastroenterologist or a colorectal surgeon to have a colonoscopy.”
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Symptoms
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Patients who are age 40 or older and notice one of the following should consult their physician:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           A change in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation) that lasts one week or longer
          </li>
          <li>
           Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool
          </li>
          <li>
           Cramping or severe stomach pain
          </li>
          <li>
           Decreased appetite
          </li>
          <li>
           Vomiting
          </li>
          <li>
           Weakness, fatigue
          </li>
          <li>
           Jaundice
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          “Some generalized symptoms would be fatigue, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding and bloating of the abdomen,” Burton says. “Yet it is one of those things where a lot of people do not have any symptoms. The gold standard (to begin screening) is age 50, but the patient must consider family history and their own body. This reemphasizes the need for the primary care physician to listen to their patients. More times than not, the patient will communicate these feelings of worry to the nurse and he or she must be educated in the symptoms of colon cancer. The nurse must communicate this to the physician and be the patient’s advocate.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Officials at the American Cancer Society say a patient can decrease their risk for this disease by eating fruits, vegetables and whole grain foods. Additionally, they note patients should limit intake of high-fat foods and have at least 30 minutes of physical activity on 5 or more days of the week. Overweight patients should make a concerted effort to lose weight.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yet Burton says perhaps the best method of preventing the development of colon cancer is being familiar with your body and knowing when to speak with your physician.
         </p>
         <p>
          “As a nurse, I would encourage a patient to be aware of any changes, no matter how miniscule they may seem to be,” she says. “It is like breast cancer. They say the mammogram is negative, but the patient still says something isn’t right and they reexamine the patient only to find that something is there. Mammograms have been wrong before. Seek information and listen to your body.”
         </p>
         <p>
          For healthcare workers helping patients through a colorectal cancer diagnosis, Burton says being comforting and knowing the latest information about the disease will only help patients deal with the news.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Reassure the patient that the prepping of today and the sedation utilized makes a colonoscopy a very safe procedure,” she says. “The physician and nurse work hand-in-hand to promote good care of the patient. It is also imperative to have a pathologist examine any specimen or tissue under a microscope for a definitive diagnosis. On a personal note, I have a family member have polyps that the doctor was convinced were benign. The pathology report came back malignant, only reinforcing that the pathology department is crucial.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Burton, who is also the Central Kentucky Regional SGNA chapter president, helped organize a colorectal educational campaign with the Central Baptist Hospital Oncology Department.

          “In March, our oncology center, working with the American Cancer Society and our endoscopy unit, provided a table of information and video for colorectal cancer awareness month,” she says. “It was in the main lobby of the hospital and we received an excellent response. There were numerous questions by patients, family members and best friends. We had a nurse manning the table at all times and we passed out brochures and spoke with those who were interested in more information.”
         </p>

          Gail and her colleagues at the Central Kentucky Chapter #23 of SGNA also are involved in community education at the Lexington Home and Garden show for numerous years. The nurses talk with those attending the show and have information available to increase public awareness of all gastroenterology diseases, diagnostic intervention and treatment. Burton says educating the community, along with healthcare workers, is essential because this disease is preventable.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I have seen and experienced the evolution of colon cancer diagnosis and intervention,” she says. “Fortunately in 2002, we can diagnose, intervene and cure many more patients than ever before. I think every nurse and physician should take great pride in educating our patients, who are our customers. I have seen the results and I think many nurses can say they have helped at least one person. If anyone asks a nurse, ‘Do you really save lives,’ in the field of GI, the answer is yes!”

           The Polyp: A Colon’s Archrival

          Who’s that in the red suit? (And why is he the bad guy?) This is the question the American Cancer Society is posing to the public through their new ad campaign featuring Polyp Man, a pesky character who wanders the streets, dodging healthcare workers and disrupting neighborhoods, in search of a colon to victimize. The ads urge people age 50 and older to be tested for colorectal cancer with the hope of catching a polyp before it becomes cancerous. The slogan for the campaign is, “Get the test. Get the polyp. Get the cure.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in America. According to the American Cancer Society, 44 percent of Americans are currently tested for colon cancer, but more than 50 percent of all colon cancer deaths could have been detected from early screening. The good news is, the death rate from colorectal cancer has been decreasing during the past 20 years, likely because of an increase in early detection and improved treatments.
         </p>
         <p>
          As awareness of polyps and the associated risk of colon cancer continues to grow, nurses working within the endoscopy field will find it more and more necessary to stay abreast of advancements in polypectomy procedures and instrumentation. By continuing to explore these innovations, they can ensure polyp retrieval within their facilities is as safe and simple as possible.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           The Procedure
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Eric G. Weiss, MD, FACS, FASCRS, of the Department of Colorectal Surgery at Cleveland Clinic Florida in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., points out that there are a variety of instruments available to endoscopy nurses, including biopsy forceps, graspers, baskets and snares, to tackle even the most challenging polyps.
         </p>
         <p>
          The two primary methods of polyp removal are hot biopsy and snaring. Weiss says hot biopsy is typically preferred when dealing with relatively small polyps, 3 mm or less. The jaws of the forceps, between 1 and 2 mm in size, can open up to about 1 cm wide to encompass a polyp. The endoscopist then applies cautery to ablate the base of the polyp so it can be retrieved and sent to pathology for analysis.
         </p>
         <p>
          Snaring, which involves lassoing a polyp with a wire loop and shaving it off the bowel wall, is best when removing both sessile polyps (those attached by a large base) and pedunculated polyps (those attached by a stalk).
         </p>
         <p>
          Destructive techniques such as argon beam coagulation are often reserved for patients who otherwise couldn’t tolerate a colonoscopy because of preexisting health conditions, according to Weiss.
         </p>
         <p>
          Small polyps can often be suctioned through the endoscope’s working channel into a trap device attached to the suction tubing, though one drawback of this technique is the possibility of red-outs, or the obstruction of the physician’s view by the polyp itself.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another problem with suctioning is the polyp can become macerated, hindering histopathologic analysis. Naomi L. Nakao, M.D., Diplomat of Internal Medicine in New York, N.Y., points out that by preserving the polyp intact, a clinician can determine the size and type of the polyp, whether or not it has a stalk and, most importantly, whether or not it contains any malignant cells.
          <sup>
           2
          </sup>
         </p>
         <p>
          There is some controversy over whether or not small polyps — less than 1 cm in diameter — should be removed through colonoscopy. The decision is greatly dependent on the patients age, past history family history and the presence of other diseases.
          <sup>
           3
          </sup>
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           The Instruments
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          When selecting an instrument for polyp retrieval, several factors should be considered, including the size, type and location of the polyp.
         </p>
         <p>
          Maureen Cain, manager if GI Endoscopy at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., says instrument selection depends largely on physician preference. Often the physician will have a select set of instruments with which he or she is comfortable. The Mayo Clinic has a variety of instruments available, including a large snare, a small snare, a rotatable snare and hot biopsy, a regular biopsy and a cautery stick.
         </p>
         <p>
          Weiss says nurses are often more familiar with instrument options than the doctors themselves.
         </p>
         <p>
          “Nurses get to work with a lot of doctors and get a feel for different sized polyps and what different people do,” he says.
         </p>
         <p>
          The industry has moved toward disposables as opposed to reusables to address the risk of cross contamination.
         </p>
         <p>
          During this time, a variety of advancements have been made in polyp retrieval. Manufacturers are continually developing snares in different shapes and sizes to assist the endoscopy staff in retrieving a wide range of polyps. Probably two of the most recent innovations in this arena are the rotatable snare and the Nakao snare.
         </p>
         <p>
          The rotatable snare can be rotated around the polyp without continually repositioning the patient or the endoscope. Hanson says US Endoscopy’s Rotator snare can help reduce procedure time and increase patient comfort. Sarah Robinson, LPN, a GI Technician at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., says the rotatable snare can be very helpful when dealing with a polyp in a location that is difficult to reach with other snares.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Nakao snare, co-developed by Dr. Naomi Nakao and U.S. Endoscopy Group, is a combination snare and retrieval net that allows the polyp to be excised and captured with one instrument. This cuts down on procedure time and allows the physician to preserve the polyp intact. Surgeons opting to use the Nakao snare will need to use an endoscope with a 3.2 channel or larger. Hanson says it appears most colonoscopes made today meet this size requirement.
         </p>
         <p>
          Weiss says in general it is not the type of snare that is most important, but rather the level of familiarity the person performing the procedure has with the device.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the biggest improvements in polyp retrieval, he adds, is in energy delivery systems. Rather than simply delivering a constant voltage of electricity to the polyp site, new technology can actually monitor the amount of current flowing through the tissue and adjust its strength as needed to further reduce the risk of perforation.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Difficult polyps
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Small, pedunculated polyps with a stalk are typically the easiest to remove, according to Weiss.
         </p>
         <p>
          Large, flat polyps, especially those located on folds, present the biggest challenge. Robinson adds that polyps located in areas such as the cecum and the ascending colon also require a special level of care.
         </p>
         <p>
          Saline-epinephrine injection is one technique that is improving safety in retrieval procedures. A needle is inserted through the colonoscope and used to inject saline, epinephrine, or both at the base of the polyp. This causes the polyp to rise and creates a cushion or gap between the polyp and the bowel wall, decreasing the risk of perforation. The polyp can then be removed with a large snare. Pieces of the polyp remaining along its periphery can be chipped away using a smaller snare.
         </p>
         <p>
          Jerome D. Waye, in his article, “How to Tackle the Tricky Polyp,” states that injecting the base of a large polyp may not be the best removal approach for the reason that it causes the stalk to swell and can make snare placement more difficult.
          <sup>
           4
          </sup>
         </p>
         <p>
          He does note, however, that polyps in the right colon, while tricky, will often respond well to saline injection and piecemeal polypectomy.
         </p>
         <p>
          The “spike” snare is another tool that can assist a physician in retrieval of a more difficult flat polyp. A tiny needle at the tip of the snare latches into the mucosa so the snare does not slip, but instead opens wider as it encompasses the polyp. Hanson says a good “spike” snare will remain latched to the mucosa without causing trauma to the tissue.
         </p>
         <p>
          A basket, or mesh-covered snare, is a useful tool in retrieving large polyps once they have been removed with a standard snare.
         </p>
         <p>
          The probability of failing to retrieve a polyp ranges from 2.1 percent to 16.5 percent and is often a result of several factors including loss during aspiration, fragmentation during suctioning and disappearance in a pool of fluid or behind a fold.
          <sup>
           1
          </sup>
         </p>
         <p>
          Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMRs) devices, once approved, should offer yet another option in polyp removal, according to Weiss. The device pulls the polyp into a chamber, invaginates the bowel wall, and then uses stapling technology to eliminate the problem, he explains.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are a large number of variables to consider when performing polypectomy, from the patient’s health history to the type of polyp being retrieved.

           Reducing Colon Cancer with Baby Aspirin
          </a>
         </h2>

        <!-- .entry-header -->

         <p>
          Researchers have determined once-a-day baby aspirin may decrease a person’s chance of developing colon cancer. With many aging Americans already taking aspirin daily to prevent heart attacks, the news signals hope for gastronenterologists and gerontologists.
         </p>
         <p>
          The research was directed by John Baron, MD, of Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H. The team intended to determine if aspirin could prevent the return of polyps after a colonoscopy. Studying 1,121 otherwise healthy adults who previously had polyps removed, the team discovered aspirin decreased the chance of polyp recurrence by 19 percent. Study participants living in nine cities nationally were given either 80 mm of baby aspirin daily or a placebo.
         </p>
         <p>
          A follow-up with the same group of participants three years later determined the group receiving aspirin had a 38-percent chance of polyp recurrence, in comparison to a 47-percent chance in the placebo group. A separate group receiving full-size aspirin had a 45-percent recurrence rate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Baron said the years of research produced an unexpected response.
         </p>
         <p>
          “It took several years to recruit the subjects and each subject was followed for three years,” he says. “So after six years of clinical work, we were able to get the preliminary data analyses done in a few months. We were surprised by the unusual dose-response relationship.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Martin Avalos, MD, FACG at the VA Medical Center in Tampa, Fla., says he is not surprised by the findings and will consider recommending baby aspirin for patients he considers at risk of developing colon cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          “The protective effect of the aspirin did not become statistically significant until 20 years of steady aspirin intake,” he says. “With aspirin, we just need to tell people to be patient. It will take a long time to see the effects, but those who start taking it at age 40 will be OK.”
         </p>
         <p>
          Avalos, who presented research concerning colon cancer screening at the 2001 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (SGNA) conference, says for the majority of his patients, taking aspirin is already a habit.
         </p>
         <p>
          “I work for the government, so most of the patients in the Veterans Administration (VA) system are already on aspirin for their hearts,” he says. “It is probably protecting their hearts to begin with, but it is beneficial for their colons, too.”
         </p>
         <p>
          An estimated 500,000 Americans take aspirin daily to prevent heart attacks. A January 2002 journal article in the
          <i>
           Annals of Internal Medicine
          </i>
          discussed new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The group urged Americans with statistical risks of having a heart attack to consult their physician about the benefits of taking aspirin. In the article, researchers state the more heart attack risk factors a person has, the more aspirin helps to prevent heart attacks.
         </p>
         <p>
          Additional research concerning the effect of Vioxx and Celebrex on the recurrence of polyps is underway as well. The arthritis drugs are suspected to slow or prevent the growth of polyps, but do not carry the side effects that can plague patients taking aspirin. Aspirin causes ulcers, bleeding and can prevent clotting.
         </p>
         <p>
          Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, Celebrex and ibuprofen, reportedly block the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for fueling colon polyp growth.
         </p>
         <p>
          Colon cancer, which kills an estimated 48,000 Americans annually, can be determined in the early stages via a colonoscopy. As the second leading form of lethal cancer in the United States, colonoscopies are highly recommended. Patients age 50 and older should have the procedure every 10 years with a follow-up every three years if polyps are discovered.
         </p>
         <p>
          Baron’s study, presented at the April meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in San Francisco, was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
