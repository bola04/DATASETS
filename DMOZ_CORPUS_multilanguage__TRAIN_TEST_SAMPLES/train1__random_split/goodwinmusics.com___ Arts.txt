        Newspaper declared "If a touring act or  local performance needs musicians — strings, brass, rhythm, anything —  there’s only one person to call: Dick Goodwin."

       Gordon (Dick) Goodwin is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of South Carolina. He was a  recipient of USC's prestigious Educational Foundation Award, is the  2001 Elizabeth O'Neill Verner Individual Artist winner (the highest  honor awarded in the arts by the State of South Carolina.) And he has  received a number of writer awards from ASCAP (American Society of  Composers and Publishers.)

        “He’s kind of the goto person if an arrangement doesn’t  exist for the orchestra,” says Rhonda Hunsinger, the South Carolina  Philharmonic’s executive director.

      <p class="fonts_for_center">
       "I grew up in Cape Girardeau, Missouri and El Paso,  Texas and decided at a very early age that music would be my life's  work. I loved teaching and I had a successful run of it. But I now have  the time (and still have the energy) to concentrate full-time on

       — composing, arranging, producing, and performing.

      <p class="fonts_for_center">
       Prior to coming to the University of South Carolina  he taught composition and theory and ran the jazz program (which he  initiated) at the University of Texas. Before that he spent four long  years as a band director in the US Coast Guard.
