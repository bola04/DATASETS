           We praise thee, O God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord. All the earth doth worship thee: the Father everlasting. To thee all Angels cry aloud: the Heavens, and all the Powers therein. To thee Cherubim and Seraphim: continually do cry, Holy, Holy, Holy: Lord God of Sabaoth; Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty: of thy glory. The glorious company of the Apostles: praise thee. The goodly fellowship of the Prophets: praise thee. The noble army of Martyrs: praise thee. The holy Church throughout all the world: doth acknowledge thee; The Father: of an infinite Majesty; Thine honourable, true: and only Son; Also the Holy Ghost: the Comforter. Thou art the King of Glory: O Christ. Thou art the everlasting Son: of the Father. When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: thou didst not abhor the Virgin’s womb. When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death: thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers. Thou sittest at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father. We believe that thou shalt come: to be our Judge. We therefore pray thee, help thy servants: whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood. Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: in glory everlasting. O Lord, save thy people: and bless thine heritage. Govern them: and lift them up forever. Day by day: we magnify thee; And we worship thy Name: ever world without end. Vouchsafe, O Lord: to keep us this day without sin. O Lord, have mercy upon us: have mercy upon us. O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us: as our trust is in thee. O Lord, in thee have I trusted: let me never be confounded.

            Just as the tide was flowing
           </em>
           , Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958)
           <br/>
           One morning in the month of May,
           <br/>
           Down by some rolling river,
           <br/>
           A jolly sailor, I did stray,
           <br/>
           When I beheld my lover,
           <br/>
           She carelessly along did stray,
           <br/>
           A-picking of the daisies gay;
           <br/>
           And sweetly sang her roundelay,
           <br/>
           Just as the tide was flowing.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           O! her dress it was so white as milk,
           <br/>
           And jewels did adorn her.
           <br/>
           Her shoes were made of the crimson silk,
           <br/>
           Just like some lady of honour.
           <br/>
           Her cheeks were red, her eyes were brown,
           <br/>
           Her hair in ringlets hanging down;
           <br/>
           She’d a lovely brow, without a frown,
           <br/>
           Just as the tide was flowing.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           I made a bow and said, Fair maid,
           <br/>
           How came you here so early?
           <br/>
           My heart, by you it is betray’d
           <br/>
           For I do love you dearly.
           <br/>
           I am a sailor come from sea,
           <br/>
           If you will accept of my company
           <br/>
           To walk and view the fishes play,
           <br/>
           Just as the tide was flowing.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           No more we said, but on our way
           <br/>
           We’d gang’d along together;
           <br/>
           The small birds sang, and the lambs did play,
           <br/>
           And pleasant was the weather.
           <br/>
           When we were weary we did sit down
           <br/>
           Beneath a tree with branches round;
           <br/>
           For my true love at last I’d found,
           <br/>
           Just as the tide was flowing.

           </em>
           <br/>
           It was a comely young lady fair,
           <br/>
           Was walking out for to take the air;
           <br/>
           She met a sailor all on her way,
           <br/>
           So I paid attention to what they did say.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           Said William, “Lady, why walk alone?
           <br/>
           The night is coming and the day near gone.”
           <br/>
           She said, while tears from her eyes did fall,
           <br/>
           “It’s a dark-eyed sailor that’s proving my downfall.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           “It’s two long years since he left the land;
           <br/>
           He took a gold ring from off my hand,
           <br/>
           We broke the token, here’s part with me,
           <br/>
           And the other lies rolling at the bottom of the sea.”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           Then half the ring did young William show,
           <br/>
           She was distracted midst joy and woe.
           <br/>
           “O welcome, William, I’ve lands and gold
           <br/>
           For my dark-eyed sailor so manly, true and bold.”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
           Then in a village down by the sea,
           <br/>
           They joined in wedlock and well agree.
           <br/>
           So maids be true while your love’s away,
           <br/>
           For a cloudy morning brings forth a shining day.

           This is my second year singing with Dulces Voces. I begin
           <a href="http://dulcesvoces.com/?p=453" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
            <strong>
             Elizabeth Regina
            </strong>
           </a>
           singing alto on William Byrd’s
           <em>
            O Lord, let they servant Elizabeth
           </em>
           and, if I’m brave and don’t chicken out and jump up the octave, I will sing a low E-flat below middle C. Then, on the opener for the second half, I sing soprano on Ralph Vaughan Williams’s
           <em>
            Just as the tide was flowing
           </em>
           , which takes me up to a high A-flat. Provided everything goes according to plan, I will have sung a full two and a half octaves. If, however, this light, lyric soprano doesn’t quite make it down to that low E-flat in the beginning, we’ll only hear a measly two octaves. I’ll try not to disappoint.
          </p>
          <p>
           I’m far from the first vocally versatile member of Dulces Voces. Holly, who has been with the group since long before I moved to Lincoln, regularly dumbfounds me with her range. She spends a lot of this concert (and most concerts lately) singing tenor — regularly hitting that low E-flat with ease. She’ll then turn around in rehearsal sometimes and break out into a soprano line higher than anything I’ve sung in public to date. We have other members that jump around on parts as well — Laura and I have been trading off singing soprano and alto, John occasionally hops up to tenor from his usual happy place of bass/baritone, and perhaps most impressive to me, Colleen will sometimes take a break from rehearsing her alto line to sit at the piano and play parts.

           The concert’s music itself spans a wide range of affects and requires a lot of musical versatility from all of us. We have the stillest of the still in John Tavener’s
           <em>
            The Lord’s Prayer
           </em>
           (the instructions in the score literally tell the singers to sing with as little dynamic contrast as possible). Contrast that with the very model of lively Renaissance-era polyphony in Thomas Weelkes’
           <em>
            As Vesta was from Latmos hill descending
           </em>
           , which is used in almost every undergraduate music history course as an early example of musical variety and text painting. Never mind that those two pieces of music were written four centuries apart.
          </p>
          <p>
           As much of a challenge as it is to put together such a diverse collection of songs, the members of Dulces Voces have embraced it and had a lot of fun putting it together. One common thread through it all is everything will be in English, even the one with the Latin title, the Orlando Gibbons
           <em>
            Te Deum
           </em>
           . And after all, the two Elizabethan eras include most, if not all, of England’s most treasured choral music.

Then said the angel: “Dread not thou, For ye be conceived with great virtue Whose name shall be called Jesu.” Then said the angel: Verily, I am your servant truly, Ecce ancilla Domini (Behold the handmaiden of the Lord).

           <small>
            Creator of the stars of night, Thy people’s everlasting light, Jesu, Redeemer, save us all, and hear Thy servants when they call. Thou, grieving that the ancient curse should doom to death a universe, hast found the medicine, full of grace, to save and heal a ruined race. Thou camest, the Bridegroom of the bride, as drew the world to evening tide, proceeding from a virgin shrine, the spotless Victim all divine. At whose dread Name, majestic now, all knees must bend, all hearts must bow; and things celestial Thee shall own, and things terrestrial Lord alone. O Thou whose coming is with dread, to judge and doom the quick and dead, preserve us, while we dwell below, from every insult of the foe. To God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, Three in One, laud, honour, might, and glory be from age to age eternally. Amen.

            Where charity and love are, God is there. Christ’s love has gathered us into one. Let us rejoice and be pleased in Him. Let us fear, and let us love the living God. And may we love each other with a sincere heart. Where charity and love are, God is there. As we are gathered into one body, Beware, lest we be divided in mind. Let evil impulses stop, let controversy cease, And may Christ our God be in our midst. Where charity and love are, God is there. And may we with the saints also, see Thy face in glory, O Christ our God: The joy that is immense and good, Unto the ages through infinite ages. Amen.

            O resplendent Virgin, here on the high mountain, glowing with miraculous wonders where the believers from everywhere ascend.
            <br/>
            Ah, with your gentle loving eye behold those caught in the bonds of sin, to let them not suffer the blows of Hell, but let them be with the blessed by your intercession.

            This is how Holy Mary cured in Her church in Salas a man who was crippled in his body and limbs.
            <br/>
            “As men may be paralyzed because of their misdeeds, so may they then be made whole by the Virgin.”
            <br/>
            It happened that a man, because of sins he had committed, was crippled in his limbs from an illness he had suffered.
            <br/>
            He remained thus for five years, unable to move, so badly twisted were all the members of his body.
            <br/>
            Because of this terrible infirmity that he had, he promised that if he got well, he would go to Salas at once and would offer Holy Mary a pound of wax each year.
            <br/>
            He got well immediately and had no further complaints.
            <br/>
            For this miracle they thanked and praised Holy Mary because She frees the sick from suffering and pain, and furthermore,
            <br/>
            She is always praying for us sinners, hence we should all forever be Her loyal subjects.

           <span class="_4n-j _fbReactionComponent__eventDetailsContentTags fsl" data-testid="event-permalink-details">
            Bryon Hartley, Wendy Jane Bantam, and a community Skateboard Art Show in honor of Precision Skateboard’s 31st Anniversary. If you ever wondered where early music and skateboard art intersected, it’s at the corner of 22nd and Y Streets this Friday. Admission is free and refreshments will be served. We start singing at 5:15.

That the stars were dew, that the heat was snowfall. Your skirt your blouse, your heart her home. She fell asleep on the shore, you at the tip of a branch.

            <br/>
            and day after day he asked her
            <br/>
            Why do you look so distraught?
            <br/>
            She already knew the good that she had within her.

            Because of his virtue may the Messiah come
            <br/>
            To redeem all Israel

            This is how Holy Mary cured in Her church in Salas a man who was crippled in his body and limbs.
            <br/>
            “As men may be paralyzed because of their misdeeds, so may they then be made whole by the Virgin.”
            <br/>
            It happened that a man, because of sins he had committed, was crippled in his limbs from an illness he had suffered.
            <br/>
            He remained thus for five years, unable to move, so badly twisted were all the members of his body.
            <br/>
            Because of this terrible infirmity that he had, he promised that if he got well, he would go to Salas at once and would offer Holy Mary a pound of wax each year.
            <br/>
            He got well immediately and had no further complaints.
            <br/>
            For this miracle they thanked and praised Holy Mary because She frees the sick from suffering and pain, and furthermore,
            <br/>
            She is always praying for us sinners, hence we should all forever be Her loyal subjects.

           -esque unaccompanied Christmas piece. I finally got around to doing it when there was a call for scores, a choir in Florida wanted Christmas music. So I wrote the piece over a weekend and sent it off. It didn’t get selected, so I sent it to the Concordia (Nebraska) choir and they premiered it.”

           The Archangel Gabriel is an important part of the Christmas story. He is the messenger who visits Mary and announces she will give birth to Jesus. He is the subject of one of our favorite
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pliqObTHxUQ" target="_blank">
            carols,
           </a>
           and we have sung the story of his visit countless times over the years. But music is not the only art form that tells stories. That’s why we are thrilled to have this messenger with us on Saturday evening in the form of an icon. Local artist Anne Sheedy Gardner created, or “wrote,” it using traditional techniques from the sixteenth century and earlier. She used clay, gesso, ground pigments, egg tempura, and 24 karat gold, praying through each brushstroke.
          </p>
          <p>
           “I encountered my first icons at an early age growing up in San Francisco and then again as a music conservatory student in Rome when I was a teenager.  They called to me. There is tremendous peace in doing this focused, contemplative practice. There is great humility in offering oneself to this process with the hope of eventually helping others in their own spiritual practices.  Sacred art can illuminate all our lives and bring us peace.”
          </p>
          <p>
           Anne currently studies the Prosopon School Russian influenced/Byzantine techniques with iconographer, Jane Tan Creti. She was educated in Rome, New York City, and London. She recently retired from teaching music at Peru State College. She is on the faculty of the School of Sacred Art in New York City and lives in Lincoln, Nebraska. We hope you will spend a few moments with Gabriel on Saturday evening before or after the concert, or during intermission.

           Christina Rossetti was an English poet of the Victorian era. She and Elizabeth Barrett Browning are considered the greatest female poets of their time. Rossetti’s poetry was also famously set in the popular Christmas songs,

            O Earth, lie heavily upon her eyes;
            <br/>
            Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching, Earth;
            <br/>
            Lie close around her; leave no room for mirth
            <br/>
            With its harsh laughter, nor for sound of sighs.
            <br/>
            She hath no questions, she hath no replies,
            <br/>
            Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth
            <br/>
            Of all that irked her from the hour of birth;
            <br/>
            With stillness that is almost Paradise.
            <br/>
            Darkness more clear than noon-day holdeth her,
            <br/>
            Silence more musical than any song;
            <br/>
            Even her very heart has ceased to stir:
            <br/>
            Until the morning of Eternity
            <br/>
            Her rest shall not begin nor end, but be;
            <br/>
            And when she wakes she will not think it long.

           Rossetti experimented with many poetic forms, and followed the Romantic tradition of meditations on death and loss.
           <em>
            Rest
           </em>
           follows that tradition, using the Italian Sonnet form (abba abba bcb ddc). Vaughan Williams’ phrasing masterfully follows the speech rhythm and line length of the poetry while adding an emotional undercurrent that cannot be expressed in words. You probably won’t hum this tune as you leave the concert. Instead, you will certain to carry it with you when you leave, in the “silence more musical than song.”
