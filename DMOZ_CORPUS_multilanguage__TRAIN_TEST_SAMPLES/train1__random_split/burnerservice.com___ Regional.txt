       Solar thermal systems are those that use panels called collectors mounted on the roof to heat water.  They collect free energy from the sun and store it in your hot water cylinder. A boiler or immersion heater can be used to back up the collectors and bring the water to the temperature you require.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They can provide savings on your energy bills, cut down on the carbon dioxide produced by gas, electric and oil fired installations and provide earnings - once the government has agreement on its Renewable Heat Incentive.

       We can currently convert 2 and 4 oven gas, oil and solid fuelled Agas. Rayburn and Esse Stanley cookers are in research. Note that if your range currently heats your water you will need to provide an immersion heater or convert plumb the cylinder in to your boiler. We can advise further on this during our survey.

        Ramtech CS is a small privately owned independent service company based in Gloucestershire which specialises in oil fired heating equipment. This is where we started back in 1995.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our core activity then was to undertake the service and repair of oil boilers. Also very quickly we formed long standing relationships with boiler manufacturers to provide field service support for them in our local region.  That success brought us to the attention of local installers who use us to commission condensing boilers for them. From there we expanded out into commission boilers and associated plant for households, commercial properties and country estates. We then ventured into oil fired range cookers such as Aga's and Rayburns.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our reputation now precedes us and it is always a satisfying to take enquiring calls from new clients as a result of referrals from satisfied customers. We have more than 4000 clients many of whom use our services annually.

       Frequently Asked Questions
      </h1>
      <p class="grid onehalf">
       <span class="green">
        How often do I need to service my boiler?
       </span>
       <br/>
       Manufacturers' recommend that your boiler is serviced once a year, this ensures that your boiler operates safely and at its most efficient.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oil fired range cookers need to be serviced every 6 months.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <span class="green">
        My boiler has stopped working, what should I do?
       </span>
       <br/>
       1. Visually check your oil, gauges are notoriously inaccurate and we regularly have clients call us convinced that they have fuel, only to find that the gauge was lying!
       <br/>
       2. Make sure that the heating and or domestic hot water is on and that thermostats are 'calling' for heat from the boiler. Try pressing the 'lockout' button, if you unsure about this, consult the manual or call us for free phone support. Note that most boiler manufacturers state that the lockout button should be pressed only twice.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <span class="green">
        I ran out of oil and now my boiler won't start. What should I do now?
       </span>
       <br/>
       Try the lockout button first as stated above, if the boiler doesn't fire after 2 presses you may need the oil line purging. Call us to arrange and we will visit you as soon as an engineer is available.
