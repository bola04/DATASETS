           Lukaku, Hazard, Mertens doubtful for England game

           <p>
            Roberto Martinez revealed that Romelu Lukaku is an injury doubt for Belgium's tie against England after the in-form striker picked up an ankle injury on Saturday. "We need to look at Lukaku's ankle. He took a knock and has to be assessed," said Martinez, who revealed man-of-the-match Eden Hazard also picked up an injury. "Eden Hazard has a calf knock, Dries Mertens has an ankle problem. There will be major changes against England. If we could have seven days to prepare, I'd say we'd start with the same team, but the reality is that you are only as good as the 23 players."

            Douglas Costa will miss Brazil's game against Serbia on Wednesday with a thigh injury, team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said. Costa injured the thigh in Brazil's 2-0 victory over Costa Rica on Friday and, after scans, was ruled out for the Group E game in Moscow.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Yesterday, at the end of the game, Douglas Costa complained of pain in the back of his right thigh, only remembering that he was injured, but in the left thigh," Lasmar said on Saturday. "It's been diagnosed as a small muscle injury, so he will not travel with us. He will stay in Sochi."

            Real Madrid have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, 19, from Zorya Luhansk for a reported initial fee of €8.5 million. Lunin already has two senior caps for Ukraine. The permanent transfer to the La Liga giants was confirmed by a short club statement released Friday afternoon.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Real Madrid and FC Zorya Luhansk have agreed the signing of the player Andriy Lunin, who will be attached to the club for the next six seasons," the statement said. Lunin could now be sent on loan or perhaps take the place in the senior squad of Luca Zidane, who is expected to leave the Bernabeu this summer after his father Zinedine Zidane stepped down as coach.

The 36-year-old has joined Cagliari having spent 15 years at Shakhtar Donetsk. Srna last featured for the Ukrainian champions in September 2017 after he failed a drugs test last March. Srna was handed a 17-month suspension, backdated when he failed the test - and will be able to return to action in August for the 2018-19 season. The full-back has signed a one-year contract with the Serie A club.

            Fenerbahce have appointed former PSV Eindhoven manager Phillip Cocu as their new coach on a three-year deal after parting ways with Aykut Kocaman. Fenerbahce, under new ownership after two decades, ended the contract of Kocaman after one season on Monday. Cocu led PSV to their 24th Eredivisie title this past campaign, outlasting rivals Ajax to win their third championship in four years. The Dutch champions have confirmed that former player Mark van Bommel will replace him.

            Germany center back Mats Hummels is likely to miss his side's Group F encounter with Sweden on Saturday. The Bayern Munich defender sustained a cervical injury in training, Germany coach Joachim Loew said. A likely replacement for Hummels for Saturday's match is Antonio Ruediger but Loew said he would wait until matchday to check on Hummels' condition. The world champions, who suffered a shock opening game loss to Mexico, must avoid another defeat which could see them crash out at a World Cup group stage for the first time in 80 years.

            Roma have completed the signing of Justin Kluivert from Ajax for an initial fee of €17.25m with the transfer including a number of performance-related clauses, based on the player and the club. The 19-year-old Netherlands international was linked with a move to Manchester United but opted for the Italian capital in a move that will keep him at the club until 2023. Kluivert, the son of former Barcelona forward Patrick, made 30 appearances for Ajax in the Eredivisie last season, scoring 10 goals.

            Sweden could be missing a few players for Saturday's group match against defending champion Germany because of illness and injury. Defenders Pontus Jansson and Filip Helander, and midfielder Marcus Rohden remained in Gelendzhik on Friday after becoming ill with a stomach bug while the rest of the team flew to Sochi. Sweden coach Janne Andersson said the hope is the three will be feeling well enough to travel to Sochi on Saturday and join the squad ahead of the match against Germany. Meanwhile, forward Isaac Kiese Thelin hurt his ankle in practice and did not train on Friday.

            Centre-back Ramiro Funes Mori has joined Villarreal from Everton after spending three seasons at Goodison Park. The 27-year-old Argentine has signed a four-year deal with the La Liga club. The transfer fee was not disclosed. Funes Mori moved to Everton from River Plate in September 2015 for £11.6 million, making 67 appearances in all competitions for the club. However, a knee injury suffered in March 2017 saw him play in just four matches for the club after recovering. Funes Mori was included in Jorge Sampaoli's preliminary World Cup squad list but missed out when the team was cut to 23 for the finals in Russia.

            The Pittsburgh Pirates have put veteran catcher Francisco Cervelli on the seven-day concussion disabled list. The Pirates made the move Friday night just before the start of their game with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Cervelli left the June 9 game against the Cubs at Chicago in the fourth inning after being struck on the helmet and left of his jaw by a foul tip off the bat of Jason Heyward. Cervelli passed the concussion protocol and played in six more games, but began feeling symptoms Thursday night late in the Pirates' 9-3 loss to the Diamondbacks.
