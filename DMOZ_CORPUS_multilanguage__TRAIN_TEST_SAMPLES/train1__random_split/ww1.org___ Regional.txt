 destroyed the German cannon,

     This particular research all started when on
 Christmas Eve, 1991, when the museum's Director
     <br/>
     was introduced to the grave located in the village cemetery of Cartigny,
 Department of the Somme,
     <br/>
     France, located a few km east-south-east of Peronne, of World War One fame.
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font size="+1">
     The grave is no longer unidentified, as a new 
 20" X 36" grave marker was dedicated on the
     <br/>
     10th of November, 2000, 56 years to the day of the death of the three men whose 
 partial remains
     <br/>
     are buried in the grave.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The grave marker provides the names and all the information required to verify 
 our research into
     <br/>
     the identity of the three B-24J
    </font>
    <font size="+1">
     crewmen
 whose partial remains are buried
 in this common grave. The
     <br/>
     result of the only fully

    <font size="+1">
     witnessed
 and documented case of American
 Soldiers of World War Two
     <br/>
     recovering the remains
    </font>
    <font size="+1">
     of dead
 American Aviators and later hiding
 most of the remains they recovered
     <br/>
     along a French road.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The origin of the Grave at Cartigny, can now be fully 
 explained.  Nine years and eleven months
     <br/>
     after the beginning of the quest that Christmas Eve, the only living survivor of 
 the three men from
     <br/>
     the
 hospital unit attached to the 397th Bombardment group was found by pure luck.  
 The man I
     <br/>
     finally located, PFC Barney Silva, had been an ambulance driver and he drove one 
 of the hospital's
     <br/>
     Doctors and an Enlisted Medical Sgt. to the crash site.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     From his testimony, we now know, that the remains of the three men in their 
 "
     <i>
      <b>
       Official Graves
      </b>
     </i>
     "
     <br/>
     were recovered
 by these three men, after their arrival at the crash site at 3:30 a.m. in 
 the early
     <br/>
     morning of
 10 November, 1944, about one hour after the crash.  They left the crash 
 site at 06:30
     <br/>
     to take the three newly created
     <b>
      <i>
       "Official Burial Packages"
      </i>
     </b>
     to 
 their main, reporting hospital at St-Quentin
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The remains recovered in those hours before full light 
 became the "
     <i>
      <b>
       Official Remains
      </b>
     </i>
     " accounted
     <br/>
     for by Capt. Judson, the Doctor, which were buried in the men's "
     <i>
      <b>
       Official 
 Graves
      </b>
     </i>
     ."  However, they had
     <br/>
     recovered only the larger remains of the three men killed, which totaled about 
 the weight on one man,
     <br/>
     120/150 pounds and they left the crash site, leaving the rest 
 of the men's remains
 unaccounted for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When full daylight finally came that late, cloudy fall day, 
 the people around the crash site began to
     <br/>
     find more and more pieces of men.  In mid-morning, another ambulance believed to 
 be from the
     <br/>
     hospital
 located in Peronne, came to the crash site.  This is the ambulance crew that 
 the French
     <br/>
     helped recover
 the "bits and pieces of human, about what one see when one prepares sausage"
     <br/>
     is 
 the most heard quote
 from those that helped these men recover the rest of the crew's remains
     <br/>
     at the 
 crash site.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As no one in this crew has been found, one has to believe 
 they found out that the Air Base Hospital
     <br/>
     had already turned over remains to a hospital at St-Quentin about 15 miles to 
 the east.  By regulation,
     <br/>
     they should  have taken men's remains to 
 that hospital.  However, they did
 not.  What they did do,
     <br/>
     was to stop by the road and bury the remains they 
 had just recovered with the
 help of the French
     <br/>
     people.  What they did not know, was that they were 
 observed by one of the French who had just
     <br/>
     helped them recover what they were illegally hiding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, now we know and can prove with an American participate, 
 that the Village Priest who recovered
     <br/>
     the second set of remains hidden by the Americans was correct in his statement 
 at the time.  And, that
     <br/>
     the French who believe the remains in the grave was all the remains recovered 
 are also correct.  For
     <br/>
     the grave does contain the vast majority of the remains of the three American 
 Aviator killed in the crash
     <br/>
     of their B-24J, SN: 42-51226, 36th BS (RCM) about 2:30 a.m., 10 November, 1944.

 we have located and verified a member of the HQ Company

 it, flying a circle, flew over the village and crashed in the

 other Americans in the area have already described.
