        Benefits of a Psychic Reading:
       </h2>
       <p style="padding:8px;padding-right:308px;">
        A reading will help someone find clarity in the ups and downs of life.  It helps in understanding what is going on in relationships, family and career. Often we have confusion and believe that things are happening for no reason.  There is a reason for everything and a reading can help in bringing peace of mind in our lives.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A medium reading allows closure in our relationships with people who have passed on.  It brings peace to the person who has died aswell as to the client.  Often there are unresolved feelings with death and through a medium reading it is possible to heal on a very deep level.

         We just wanted to express how Linda and I were impressed in our sessions with you last month. I had never had a reading and to be honest was very skeptical not knowing what to expect. You made me feel at ease and relaxed. You then told me things that only I would know and thereby removed the doubt I had at first. I must say it was astounding what you related to me as a medium. I do appreciate you seeing us on short notice and maybe we will contact you in the future for a continuance of questions we might have.

         I was able to ask my mother a few questions (she passed a few years ago), and Sheree moderated the conversation. My psychic reading was amazing. She was incredibly accurate as to past events that had happened, and reminded me of things I had forgotten. It's nice to have a local St. Augustine psychic who I can trust. What a talent.

         Dr Silver has the unique gift of tapping into your energies and seeing what the possibilities could look like. Her advice always keeps to the positive and offers a person "food for thought".   Sheree's knowledge of numbers and how they relate to life in the present, past and future is remarkable. A reading with Sheree creates a nice roadmap to navigate your issues at hand and chart a better course for the future.

         Thank you so much for doing my past life regression.  I have wanted to do one for many years, but never found anyone I felt I could trust.  I'm so glad I found you, a professional with a Ph.D.  Your many years of experience also overcame my nervousness, for which I am very thankful.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I wanted you to know that since the regression, so many things in my present life have begun to make sense.  While I did the past life regression mostly out of curiosity, it is amazing how much I have learned and grown spiritually from this experience.  I have been able to confirm several important and unusual details from the past life which completely answered my own skepticism.  It's like a whole new world has opened up and I understand so much more about my choices, my life, and the amazing people I am blessed to have in it.  None of that would have been possible without your help.  From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!

         I had never had a reading before Sheree's.  I had not met her or had ever spoken to her before my reading.  I was very impressed with how she knew so much about my health and my feelings about things.  I have taken her advice on several things and find myself feeling better both mentally and health wise.  I will continue to follow her advice and want to say, "Thank You, Sheree!"

I would recommend her to anyone seeking metaphysical assistance or advice.

         Nearly 10 years ago. I was referred to Sheree Silver by a friend who had been studying with her. At my first reading, she introduced me to the science of numerology. Her reading was 100% accurate as to the circumstances of my life. I learned that numerology is one of the best predictors of what will happen, or may happen. I was so impressed with her knowledge and abilities, that I continued to go to her for individual healing sessions. They always produced some degree of relief. As a friend once said, he never felt so relaxed in his life.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I have been interested in metaphysics all my life, so when the time came for her to establish the Shiloh Spiritual Center, Inc., I attended group classes there, as well as lectures presented by guests. I observed her use her psychic gifts, as she taught us. I was so impressed with her abilities and efforts to bring enlightenment to all of us, that I became a member of that organization.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Sheree is a dynamic public speaker and teacher. I have seen her present several public workshops and the people always recieve her with enthusiasm. At the H.O.P.E Expo, presented in Jacksonville, Florida in 2004, there were many high quality speakers, including a couple of holistic MDs. I recall that the day's exit surveys showed that Sheree's workship was the highest rated of all. She is a great teacher and has brought much enlightenment to my life.

         I've had multiple psychic experiences -- and in varied contexts and settings -- with Sheree over the years. We've journeyed in group past life regressions. and I've shared one-on-one scheduled sessions. Every occasion has been revealing, helpful, and even enjoyable in its own way. But what most amazes me is what a natural she is and how seemingly easily she imparts what she senses -- almost conversationally. With her inate abilities and keen insights, she guides me in a way that's practical and useful, rather than merely mysterious. Many times, I've been in awe as I've pondered the simplicity of her words. "Wow, I can really see that. It all makes perfect sense," I'm often left wondering. Why couldn't I have connected those dots? But there it is -- that's the gift that's Sheree's.

         Because of my own personal experiences I have always been interested in the paranormal and Occult Sciences. I came to the point in my life that I realized I needed guidance, insight and answers.  What a blessing Sheree has been to be on my path. Her psychic development classes taught me to trust myself and learn the truth about my own psychic abilities.

         I have gone to see Sheree Silver several times in the past several  years and each visit was equally amazing. In one visit she told me  that I should take up ballet, which I wasn't to happy about. I always  thought of ballet as boring. That is because I knew nothing about it.  I told her that I would rather do belly dancing but she insisted she  saw ballet in my future and also mentioned the Caribbean. Well, a few  months later I met the love of my life who happened to be a  Professional Ballet Dancer from Cuba. I also decided to take some  ballet classes as she suggested and loved them very much. Thanks for  that. I can't wait to schedule my next appointment with Sheree Silver.
