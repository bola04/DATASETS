   <p>
    David Burgess has won more violin making contests of truly international scope, won them more consistently, and won them against a greater number of competitors than not only any living violin maker, but any violin maker in history! Never before has a maker, during his lifetime, established such a large body of expert consensus about the tonal, artistic and functional merit of his instruments.
   </p>
   <p>
    He has been designated "hors concours" by both the Violin Society of America and the American Federation of Violin and Bow Makers, meaning that he is no longer allowed to compete in their violin making contests by virtue of acknowledged excellence.

    Do people "antique" excessively? Photos of the "Messiah" by violin maker Antonio Stradivari, probably the most valuable violin in the world.
