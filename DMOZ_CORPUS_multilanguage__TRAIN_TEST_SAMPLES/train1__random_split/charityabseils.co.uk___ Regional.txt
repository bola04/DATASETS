       First of all
      </strong>
      you need a
 
       building [ tall or small ] that is suitable, or you can bring your event
 
       to us as we have access to a 100'
      <a href="bridge.html" target="_blank">
       viaduct
      </a>
      (we are based in the Midlands - Hulland Ward, Ashbourne, Derbyshire). Already booked the

      <br/>
      <strong>
       When you have chosen a suitable building
      </strong>
      or structure we
 
       will then come out and perform a
      <strong>
       risk assessment
      </strong>
      for your
 
       abseil.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The risk assessment is very important as it allows us to check
 
 
 
   out the whole building for suitability and assess the anchors and roof space
 
 
 
   as required. We also provide you with a method statement.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Once this has been carried out we can give you a final quote for
 
 
 
   the charity abseil and can advise on maximum numbers of abseilers we can handle
 
 
 
   on the day.

     <h2>
      Buildings and structures suitable for abseiling from
     </h2>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Many buildings are suitable
      </strong>
      and structures like bridges and viaducts
 
 
 
   make excellent abseil points.
      <strong>
       How do you find a building?
      </strong>
      We
 
 
 
   find it helps if you make a request on the local radio stations as many businesses
 
 
 
   like to be associated with charitable organisations. You can get some interest
 
 
 
   by contacting local newspapers requesting that local businesses help by letting
 
 
 
   you utilise their buildings for the abseil. Use this opportunity to find a
 
 
 
   few applicants for the abseil too!
      <br/>
      Hospitals, University buildings and Fire station- fire towers all
 
 
 
   make good venues for charity abseil events.
      <br/>
      Ask to speak to the Building Manager or the person responsible for health and
 
 
 
 safety at work to request initial permission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some buildings with pitched roofs may be unsuitable, seek those with a flat
 
 
 
   roof space preferably as they tend to be more suited to our needs. Please send
 
 
 
   photo's of any buildings to us via email for a visual inspection as it may
 
 
 
   save disappointment later [ send pictures of the roof space from several angles
 
 
 
   and the sides from a reasonable distance for best effect ] See our
      <a href="http://www.rockandice.net/twg/index.php?twg_album=Abseils" target="_blank">

      Health and Safety

     <p>
      Rock and Ice are specialists in the field of mountaineering and
 
 
 
   rock climbing [this includes abseiling] We are
      <strong>
       AALA
      </strong>
      registered
 
 
 
   -
      <strong>
       Registration
 
 
 
   number: L4596/R1374
      </strong>
      and are full members of
      <strong>
       AMI
      </strong>
      [
 
 
 
   the Association of Mountaineering Instructors] We will keep all participants
 
 
 
   safe including any press or camera teams present on the day. We are currently
 
 
 
   exempt from normal HSE working at height regulations due to the specialist
 
 
 
   nature of our work, see
      <a href="http://www.thebmc.co.uk/safety/tech/working_at_height.htm" target="_blank">
       here.
      </a>
      With this in mind we still respect working at height and take all necessary
 
 
 
   precautions to keep everyone safe at all times, it's what we do best. Richard
 
 
 
   Hogan MIA [ director of Rock and Ice ] has worked in the steeplejack trade
 
 
 
   as a lightning conductor fitter and has extensive experience working on roofs
 
 
 
   of all types- he is well qualified to carry out a risk assessment on the structure
 
 
 
   for suitability.

      <strong>
       It's a fact
      </strong>
      - you don't need to be qualified
 
       to work as an abseil instructor in the UK!
      <br/>
      This is why we display the
      <strong>
       AMI
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       AALA
      </strong>
      logos - they demonstrate
      <strong>
       we are fully qualified
      </strong>
      to work
 
       in this field, and teach with credibility. We have passed scrutiny by the
 
       HSE appointed government body
      <strong>
       AALA
      </strong>
      for working in extreme
 
       locations with adults and children alike.
      <strong>
       The BMC
      </strong>
      (governing
 
       body for mountaineering and rock climbing in the UK) recommend you use MIA,
 
       MIC or BMG qualified instructors to run the events. If you choose not to
 
       use our services, please look for the above logos when choosing a reputable
 
       provider.
      <br/>
      We always have an
      <strong>
       AMI
      </strong>
      member directing the
 
 
 
   charity abseil event, most likely you will find all Rock and Ice staff are
 
 
 
   senior instructors on the day.

        A huge 5 million public liability insurance
       </strong>
      </span>
      covers the participants, the building and the instructors during the event.
 
       We should add the fact that
      <br/>
      Voluntary Helpers and the Interest [
      <em>
       Indemnity to

      ]    is
 
 
 
   also included within the insurance,

      Costs involved [unavoidable]
     </h2>
     <p>
      We don't shy away from making a profit - it ensures we stay in business, but
 
 
 
    we want the charity to benefit too.
      <br/>
      We keep our costs low, we charge less than a third of some other companies
 
 
 
   purporting to be 'specialists' in this field'.
      <span class="blue">
       <strong>
        We
 
 
 
   utilise any resources you have
       </strong>
      </span>
      to make this happen, so don't
 
 
 
   be surprised if we ask for help on the day to organise the groups by bringing
 
 
 
   them to us and taking them off the ropes at the bottom [we will train you to
 
 
 
   do this in the morning - it takes a few minutes only]
     </p>
     <p>
      The prices depend on how many instructors and ropes required. Also if a
 
       building is over 50m [150'] in height we may need to buy in specialist ropes
 
       - these are charged to the event organisers at cost. We have arrangements
 
       to buy these in at trade price from the manufacturers which makes a massive
 
       difference on your budget.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Please note: We require payment up front for all events including risk assessments
 
       - this ensures availability of instructors on the day. We are very busy
 
       and find this minimises administration and last minute measures.
     </p>
     <h2>
      What is abseiling?
     </h2>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Abseiling [abbing]
      </strong>
      is sliding down a fixed rope, often
 
       using a climbing harness and a friction device to control the speed of the
 
       descent. The technique is used primarily as a means of descent from a rock
 
       climb or a mountain.
      <strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Charity abseils
      </strong>
      differ as they are set up by professional instructors
 
       who have full control of each participant by utilising a safety back up
 
       rope and a releasable main rope [ in case of a stuck abseiler ] Therefore
 
       if a participant was to get an item of clothing jammed, the instructor can
 
       take over instantly, and release pressure on the abseiler or even lower
 
       them to the ground safely.

      </li>
      <li>
       How long will it take for people to abseil down the building?
       <span class="blue">
        This
 
         depends on the height it can vary from 5 min's to 15mins on average. We
 
         will advise after the risk assessment and initial site survey.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       What if the charity abseilers are disabled or have serious health problems?
       <span class="blue">
        This shouldn't cause a problem if we are informed before
 
         the event.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       How strong are the ropes?
       <span class="blue">
        They each hold nearly 3
 
         tonne - they
        <strong>
         do not snap
        </strong>
        under bodyweight.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       Do we need to book all the instructors in before we get the participants?
       <span class="blue">
        <strong>
         No
        </strong>
        we prefer you to call us when you
 
         have reached certain numbers so you don't overbook our services.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       Would you do our charity abseil event for free?
       <span class="blue">
        No
 
         we provide a service that facilitate these events, we have to charge a
 
         fee to ensure specialist equipment is renewed etc.
       </span>
       <span class="blue">
        We
 
         do run one free event locally most years for a charity of our choice.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       How far would you travel to run an event?
       <span class="blue">
        Distance
 
         is usually no problem.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       Have you ever had a serious accident or a fatality on a abseil event?
       <span class="blue">
        Never. Safety is paramount.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       How many is the minimum for an abseil event?
       <span class="blue">
        1 person
 
         - you would come to us usually.
       </span>
      </li>
      <li>
       What is the longest abseil you have ever done?
       <span class="blue">
        1000m
 
         on the Piz Badile in the Swiss alps
       </span>
       .
      </li>
      <li>
       Do you have any information on the origins of abseiling?
