   <h2>
    What is AppStats?
   </h2>
   AppStats is a lightweight, open source framework developed and used by
   <a href="http://www.grandcentral.com">
    Grand Central Communications, Inc.
   </a>
   to capture, analyze, and publicize health, performance, and monitoring statistics for Java applications.  With it, we are using it to:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Capture real time performance and health statistics for high availability and high concurrency production quality server applications.
    </li>
    <li>
     Real time data collection and analysis in our distributed performance and reliability testing suite (built on
     <a href="http://freeload.sourceforge.net/">
      freeload
     </a>
     , another open source GC initiative.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    AppStats' Design Goals
   </h2>
   The framework is designed to be extensible and easy to use.  Design goals include:
   <ul>
    <li>
     high performance -- minimize memory allocation and object synchronization
    </li>
    <li>
     easily adaptable to network and application monitoring packages
    </li>
    <li>
     easily integrated into existing applications
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Why would I want to use it?
   </h2>
   Appstats proves particluarly useful in the following cases:
   <ul>
    <li>
     applications designed for high availability environments with strong requirements for monitoring
    </li>
    <li>
     large sized, distributed applications with many contributors that wish to centralize collection of application statistics
    </li>
    <li>
     applications of any size designed for sampling and instrumentation
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    What is the status?
   </h2>
   Initial design and development work are completed.  We are beginning testing, documentation, and platform integration phases.
 An alpha version is available for review.  We will be submitting it for consideration to the
   <a href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/138.jsp">
    JSR-138 Performance Metric Instrumentation
   </a>
   Expert Group for review and hopefully inclusion into the spec.
