       Webtomet
      </b>
      is
         designed to read intra day share and other security price
         data directly from a live watch screen for day trading by
         using character recognition, write the data directly to
         MetaStock Professional data files in real time and update
         the charts that are open in MetaStock Professional
         automatically. Webtomet is not an online vendor,
         MetaStock accesses the data by opening the files written
         by Webtomet. It has been made to read a number of
         different watch screens and has been used on "Market
         Maker", "Quote Tracker" and "Market
         Center" and tested on several others.
      <p>
       Use when
         trading CFD's (Contracts For Difference) or put free data
         from Medved Quote Tracker directly into MetaStock
         Professional data files.

       V 3.1.29
      </p>
      <p>
       Tested on Microsoft Windows XP and with MetaStock
         professional 8 and 9 with screen size of 640 x 480 and
         larger and with multiple screens. The program now
         includes memory resource use limiting and backups on
         closing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have now found a way to make the character
         recognition read the Telequote watchscreen with the
         joined numbers and I have also made the optimized
         character recognition work properly with the arrows in
         the Market Maker watch screen so that the arrows don't
         have to be hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new MarketMaker watch screen now has a more
         difficult text to read in the symbols column, a specific
         Market Maker mode has been added.

        MetaStockRefresher
       </b>
       is included here with
         Webtomet as it is the remote refresher for MetaStock
         professional when Webtomet is being used on a different
         computer. It is also useful to automatically refresh
         MetaStock Pro when using data from an online vendor.
      </p>
      <p>
       With version 1.3.0 I have added a new function to
         reduce the chart flashing but I have only been able to
         test it on XP. It should work on other operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also with version 1.3.1 you can now select in Setup
         options to not refresh while a chart is maximized which
         will make it easier to try trend lines etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 1.3.2 does not have to remain visible for the
         reduced chart flashing to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.1 can refresh without dropping the View
         menu which further reduces the flashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.2 has been slightly modified to make
         refreshing MetaStock Pro in the background better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.3 has an option added which allows the
         reduced menu flashing option to be selected separately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.4 has a small fix to stop the mouse
         temporarily losing focus in another program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.5 removed a useless option and that was to
         just refresh all the charts on the window menu only. A
         legacy from before I worked out how to do all the charts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.6 A start up refresh switch has been added
         for programmers to use. Information is in the help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.7 Stopped the program flash when using the
         remote start up refresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.8 Minor change to the help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.0.9 Minor change to the internal code.
      </p>
      <p>
       Version 2.1.1 More cycle options including an auto setting.
