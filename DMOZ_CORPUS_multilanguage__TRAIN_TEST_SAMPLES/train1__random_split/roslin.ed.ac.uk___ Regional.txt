    Redirects from old servers
   </title>
  </head>
  <body>
   <p>
    This site has been created to host redirects from sites that are no longer active.
   </p>
   <p>
    The following procedure can be followed.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Set up the new domain
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Login to
     <a href="https://chost1.is.ed.ac.uk:2083/cpsess5170560628/frontend/x3/index.html">
      redirect cpanel host
     </a>
     . The user name and password are in infokeep for chost1.is
    </li>
    <li>
     Create a new
     <em>
      parked domain
     </em>
     with the same name as your old site
    </li>
    <li>
     Create a new redirect from the
     <em>
      parked domain
     </em>
     page to point to the new site
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Note that
    <em>
     parked domains
    </em>
    , when used in this way, can be thought of as server aliases. Also the domain root of
 each
    <em>
     parked domain
    </em>
    can be left as the default value.
   </p>
   <p>
    Wherever
    <strong>
     OLD.DOMAIN
    </strong>
    appears in the following text it needs to be replaced with the old domain name you are trying to redirect away from.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Test it
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Change your /etc/hosts (unix) or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows) file by adding the following line:
     <br/>
     129.215.10.97 OLD.DOMAIN
    </li>
    <li>
     Try and go to the old domain within your browser
    </li>
    <li>
     If it doesn't work then try a wget -S OLD.DOMAIN to find out what is happening
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
    Request the domain change
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Open a new Unidesk call or a sub call of the orginal request and ask for the DNS to be updated as follows:
     <pre>
 Can we please have the DNS updated to point OLD.DOMAIN at chost1.is.ed.ac.uk (129.215.10.97) instead of its current value.
 
 It's fine for this one to propagate overnight.
 </pre>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </body>
