   <meta content="St. John's, Newfoundland visual artist Bill Rose has exhibited his photorealistic paintings in many Canadian galleries over the past twenty years. In addition to photorealism his art may be classified as pop art, process art, mixed media, palette painting and collage often combining text and images in a compelling way. He has shown his work in Toronto at the I-Land Gallery, as well as New Brunswick at The Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador, James Baird Gallery and many more. His work is often political, often humourous or ironic while remaining very intricate and detailed. " name="description"/>
