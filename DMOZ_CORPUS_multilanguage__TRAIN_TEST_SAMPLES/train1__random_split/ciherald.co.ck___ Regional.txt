               <br/>
               As a pacific nation our cultural identity  is notably marked out by several hallmarks that clearly distinguish us as Cook  Islanders, from the tie dyed pareu that wrap our waists to the rito hats woven  specifically for the Sundays service, they are forever permanently seared into  our minds. But a building resurgence is taking place in a forgotten art form  that has for many years now been reserved as specifically Samoan and was  originally performed as a nod to our cultural distinction; as the Cook Islands  rekindle their love affair with tatau.

               Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is not widely known about here in the Cook Islands, however many Cook Islanders deal with it on a daily basis, with approximately 18 children who have been diagnosed with autism living in Rarotonga, and many more undiagnosed cases both on Rarotonga and in the outer islands, according to secretary for Autism Cook Islands, Gloria Rarere.  Autism Cook Islands is a community-based organisation formed to provide support for families living with family members who have been diagnosed with autism.  Rarere described the organisation as “mainly a support group for parents, but if we need to assist people out there in the community who don’t understand how to work with a child with autism, we go out and provide some assistance with that.”
