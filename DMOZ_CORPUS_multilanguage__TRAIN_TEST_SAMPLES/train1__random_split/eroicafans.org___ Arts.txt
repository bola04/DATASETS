          <b>
           From Eroica With Love
          </b>
          is a Japanese manga (series of 
             comic books or graphic novels) by Yasuko Aoike, which has gained a 
             following in the English-speaking world. It has a mostly 
             European setting and concerns the adventures of a British aristocrat, 
             Dorian Red, Earl of Gloria, who moonlights as an international art 
             thief using the alias "Eroica", and his opposite number, a 
             German NATO intelligence agent named Major Klaus Heinz von dem 
             Eberbach. Dorian is flamboyant, swashbuckling, hedonistic, and 
             cheerfully indifferent to most of society's conventions; he's also 
             openly homosexual. Klaus is uptight, conservative, duty-driven, 
             bad-tempered, and so repressed that he probably doesn't know himself 
             what his sexual orientation is, but he does give some indications 
             that he's not entirely immune to Dorian's attractions.
