            Whether it's the Elantra scrapping with the economy 
 	compacts or the Equus trading barbs with encrusted luxo-yachts, Hyundai 
 	seemingly has a fighter in every weight class. Among midsize sedans, the 
 	2012 Hyundai Sonata was the Korean automaker's contender. In prior years, 
 	the Sonata was nothing more than a midpack player, but that all changed with 
 	2010's full redesign, in which the Sonata gained dramatic new styling, new 
 	engines and a revamped interior.

 	everybody, especially when it returned a very impressive 28 mpg combined 
 	when paired with the six-speed automatic transmission. Equally impressive is

            The Kill Switch
            <br/>
           </strong>

          <p>
           In the attempt to lessen the risk to lenders, and bolster the available car 
 	loan programs made available to those with a bad credit background, many 
 	lenders, and used car dealers, are turning to the "Kill Switch", a device 
 	that can render a vehicle inoperatable from a remote location.
          </p>
          <p>
           What this does for lenders is remove the need for the "repo man". This may 
 	sound drastic, especially for those that may have to accept one of these 
 	devices being installed on their next used car purchase, but, in fact, this 
 	is a device that only effects, in a negative way, those who become 
 	delinquint in making payments, while, one the other hand, such devices make 
 	lenders much more comfortable with approving car loans to those who they 
 	might not otherwise approve.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some reports claim that up to 30% of the vehicles purchased today, with the 
 	help of an auto loan, have such devices installed. In any case, no 
 	such device will ever be installed on a vehicle without the consent of the 
 	buyer, and, for those buyers with a bad credit history, who have had a tough 
 	time finding a dealer, or lender, willing to provide a needed car loan, this 
 	device may be a "small price to pay" for the chance to once again qualify 
 	for that loan.

           If you're shopping for a used car, you can expect better deals this year. A large supply of trade-ins and cars 
 returning from leases will push
           <img alt="Cheap Used Cars For Sale" height="120" src="http://usedcarsale.com/images/june15/main/cheap-used-cars-for-sale.jpg" style="float: right" width="271"/>
           down overall used car prices by an estimated 2% in 2014, according to forecasters at 
 automotive web site Edmunds.com.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The popularity of leasing new cars, in recent years, plays into the expected lower used car prices. "The boom 
 in new car leases is leading to a higher number of lease returns, which adds to the growing inventory of used 
 cars, forcing their prices down," explains Philip Reed, senior consumer advice editor for Edmunds.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In turn, falling used car prices may also affect new car deals, especially low-payment lease offers. Lower used 
 car prices mean lower residual values -- what a car is worth at the end of a lease. That could result in higher 
 payments on new car leases, Reed explains. However, continuing low interest rates, especially early in the 
 year, will help hold down lease payments.

            Buyer Beware When Shopping Craigslist Cars For Sale

           A meeting set up to sell a car that had been advertised on Craigslist turned 
 	into a robbery when the would-be buyer pulled out a gun, authorities said.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The car, a 1999 Honda Accord, was recovered when the victim found it a short 
 	time
 	later
           <img alt="Craigslist Cars For Sale" height="199" src="http://usedcarsale.com/images/june15/craigslist/craigslist-car-sale-beware.jpg" style="float: left" width="246"/>
           parked near an apartment complex, but the robber wasn't there and hasn't 
 	been arrested.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Police say it started when the 36-year-old victim arranged to meet a man who 
 	wanted to buy the car and said his name was Bitor Romero.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The victim arrived at the meeting place, 8300 N. Rodney Parham Road, about 9 
 	p.m., at which point a man on the lot pointed a gun at the victim's neck and 
 	ordered him to leave while the man took off in the Accord west on Markham 
 	Street.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Police responded and took a report. The victim then called investigators a 
 	short time later and said he had found his car at 609 Brookside Drive, the 
 	report said.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Officers searched the vehicle, finding a stolen handgun inside, the report 
 	said. The weapon was dusted for fingerprints and taken as evidence.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The robber is described as a black man about 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds. He 
 	wore a white tank top, yellow shorts and white shoes.

 	Beware of any offer to pay by cashier's check made out for an amount 
 	larger then the asking price. These offers are almost always followed by 
 	an attempted theft, and request for some sort of rebate, or payment of 	shippers.
