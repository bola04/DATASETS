         Sensitive personal data
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        On occasion, and only when there is a clear reason to do so, we may collect additional data, which will be anonymised and would not be linked back to a specific individual. This could include sensitive personal data, recognised under Data Protection law as information about health, ethnicity, religious beliefs and political opinions. We may request this information to adapt the work environment for new employees or to analyse data required for funders.

        <strong>
         How we may use your data
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        We only collect data that we need in order to carry out our business and to provide a service or carry out a contract with you. For example:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         To fulfil merchandise, donation and membership requests
        </li>
        <li>
         To provide the best possible customer services and to help us with internal administration
        </li>
        <li>
         To contact you with important information relating to a purchase
        </li>
        <li>
         To send customised online marketing (if applicable)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Legal basis
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The basis under which we process any data could be one of three ways, see examples below:
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Contract Basis
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        When you make a donation, a purchase, book a workshop or apply for a job you are entering into a contract with us. In order to perform this contract we need to process and store your data. For example we may need to contact you by email or telephone in the case of problems with a purchase or payment.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Legitimate Interest
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In certain situations we collect and process your personal data for purposes that are in our legitimate organisational interests. However, we only do so if there is no overriding prejudice to you by using your personal data in this way. For example; to manage and administer our relationship with you, such as keeping our database up to date and renewing your membership; to alert you to opportunities to support Complicité, to analyse the use of our services so that we can improve your experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consent
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Consent is explicitly requested to send you updates via email about what’s on, offers and news or about supporting us. For any other situation where the above two bases are not appropriate, we will instead ask for your explicit consent before using your personal data in that specific situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Third Parties
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        We may share your details with trusted service providers who are authorised to act on our behalf in performance of a contract we enter into with them or you, for example payment processing, database services, website hosting or email communication providers. We require all other organisations with whom we share your personal data to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. Other than as expressly set out in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent, trade or distribute your personal data to third parties without your express consent or are required by law to do so. We will collect and aggregate on an anonymous basis information about you and your use of our services with information about other users of our services, such as statistical or demographic data, for analysis, reporting to stakeholders (such as Arts Council England) and to better understand our customers. For example, we may aggregate mailing list data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature on our website. However, if we combine or connect any of this type of data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data, which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

        <strong>
         How we protect your data
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committed to protecting the personal data you entrust to us. We adopt robust and appropriate technologies and policies, so the data we have about you is protected from unauthorized access and improper use. As part of the services offered to you through our website, the personal data you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). By way of example, this may happen if any of the computer servers used to host the website are located in a country outside of the EEA. If we transfer your personal data outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this privacy notice. We may transfer your data to the USA to organizations such as Facebook, Google or Mailchimp. The USA has weaker data protection laws than that of the EEA and therefore we will ensure that only organisations that are part of the EU Privacy Shield Initiative will handle your personal data. More details on this certification can be found at
        <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">
         www.privacyshield.gov
        </a>
        . We will keep your data only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice and to fulfil our legal obligations. We will not keep more data than we need. The retention period will vary according to the purpose, for example if you have made a purchase via our website then your details are retained for 28 days until the sale is complete and no returns required, alternatively if you made a donation then we will hold your details until notified by you. Where your data is no longer required, we will ensure it is disposed of, deleted or cached in a secure manner.
