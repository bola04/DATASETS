      NVME: The Future Storage Device Interface?
     </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
     There is a new interface that will probably replace SATA
    (and SCSI SAS) within a few years.  This interface is
     <b>
      NVM
    Express or NVME
     </b>
     .  SATA and SCSI SAS are limited by the
    physical I/O architecture to a few thousand I/O commands per
    second.  NVME can achieve millions of I/O commands per second.
    If you are currently working on SATA products we strongly
    suggest you start learning about NVME as it has a very good
    chance of being the primary storage device interface of the
    future.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      But a note of warning about the NVME specification:
     </b>
     The NVME specification is without question the worst written
    storage device specification of all time. Many people have
    very different ideas as to what the document says or does not
    say. If you are working on NVME you should see the our list
    of specification issues at our

      What are ATA and ATAPI?
     </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
     <b>
      ATA
     </b>
     is the real name for the mass storage device
    interface that was frequently called
     <b>
      IDE
     </b>
     or
     <b>
      EIDE
     </b>
     in the 1990s and 2000s.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      ATA
     </b>
     is short for
     <b>
      AT Attachment
     </b>
     .  The AT part
    is from the IBM PC/AT (1984).
     <b>
      ATAPI
     </b>
     is short for
     <b>
      ATA Packet Interface
     </b>
     .  ATAPI allows SCSI devices to be
    attached to the ATA interface.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ATA interface protocols and command set are widely used
    in low cost systems.  The ATA interface was first standardized
    in the early 1990s and has been updated many times over the
    last 25+ years.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      ATA
     </b>
     comes in two interface favors:
     <b>
      Parallel ATA
    (PATA)
     </b>
     and
     <b>
      Serial ATA (SATA)
     </b>
     .  Except for Compact
    Flash (CF) devices, it is basically impossible to purchase new
    systems or devices that implement PATA.  These days nearly all
    ATA devices implement the SATA interface.  However, the ATA
    command set is implemented nearly the same in both PATA and
    SATA.  But SATA does implement a command queuing scheme call
    Native Command Queuing (NCQ) that is now widely used by HDD
    and SSD devices.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some definitions:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <b>
       PATA
      </b>
      - Parallel ATA - the traditional ATA interface -
                  used by hard disk (HDD) and solid state disk (SSD and CF) drives.
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       SATA
      </b>
      - Serial ATA - serial version of the ATA interface -
                  used by hard disk drives (HDD) and solid state disk drives (SSD).
     </li>
     <li>
      <b>
       ATAPI
      </b>
      - ATAPI is used by CD, DVD and tape devices. ATAPI can be used
                  with PATA or SATA.
     </li>

    <h2>
     <font color="blue">
      What is an ATA or ATAPI device?
     </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
     An ATA device is a mass storage device that stores data in
    512-byte chunks called sectors.  These sectors are transferred
    to/from the device in contiguous blocks of data that are a
    multiple of 512 bytes.  Each sector stored by a device has a
    unique sector address that is called a Logical Block Address
    (LBA).  The first sector on a device is at LBA 0, the next at
    LBA 1, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Note that some new ATA device are allowed to have sector
    sizes other than 512 bytes but these device are generally used
    only in proprietary systems.
    </p>
    <p>
     The PI part of ATAPI is Packet Interface.  An ATAPI device
    is really a SCSI device that uses the ATA interface.
    ATAPI is one of many SCSI physical interfaces.  ATAPI
    is probably the most simple of all the SCSI physical
    interfaces.  In order to implement SCSI over ATA the SCSI
    Command Data Block (CDB) and data are transmitted over the ATA
    interface in packets using the Packet command protocol.
    These packets are generally not 512 bytes in size.  An ATAPI
    device must implement all the ATA signals and most of the ATA
    command protocols plus the ATAPI Packet command protocol.
    Unlike ATA, ATAPI devices (SCSI devices) can store data in a
    variety of formats and block sizes - such as 512 bytes used by
    many SCSI disk drives, 2048 bytes used for CD/DVD data and
    2352 bytes used by CD-DA (digital audio) data (music).  Many
    SCSI commands, such as Inquiry or Request Sense, transfer only
    a few bytes of data.

    <h2>
     <font color="blue">
      Some History and More...
     </font>
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Serial ATA (SATA)
    </h3>
    <p>
     SATA is a serial interface that emulates PATA.  SATA has
    replaced PATA in nearly all low cost storage systems and
    devices.  This includes HDD, SSD and CD/DVD devices.
    </p>
    <p>
     Around the time that SATA was becoming popular the T13
    standards committee separated the ATA command set
    from the two physical interfaces.  Starting with ATA/ATAPI-7
    there are separate standards documents for the ATA Command Set
    (ACS), ATA Parallel Transport (APT) and ATA Serial Transport
    (AST).  The ACS, APT and AST standards now move forward on
    separate schedules so now there are multiple versions of
    ACS-x, APT-x and AST-x.  However, remember that AST-x is only a
    document that maps ATA to the SATA-I/O specification that is
    from the SATA-I/O committee.  Also be aware that recently
    there have been many SCSI features that have been stuffed into
    ATA with varying degrees of success.

    </p>
    <h3>
     Parallel ATA (PATA)
    </h3>
    <p>
     PATA is the traditional ATA interface that has been
    standardized for 25+ years by the ANSI/INCITS ATA-1 through
    ATA/ATAPI-8 standards.  This interface is widely used by low
    cost disk drives and ATAPI CD/DVD and tape drives.  PCMCIA PC
    Card ATA devices and Compact Flash (CF) devices also use a
    PATA based interface (for example, the CF TrueIDE
    interfae).
    </p>
    <p>
     A Parallel ATA/ATAPI interface can support one or two
    devices.  The devices can ATA or ATAPI or both.

    <h3>
     ANSI INCITS T13
    </h3>
    <p>
     T13 is the standards committee that develops and maintains
    the ATA related ANSI/INCITS standards.  Over many years T13
    has published the ATA-x, ATA/ATAPI-x, ACS-x, APT-x and AST-x
    standards.  Visit the T13 web site for the latest
    information on meeting schedules, proposals for the next
    versions of the many ATA related standards and copies of the
    draft standards to review.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, please note that T13 is NOT responsible for the
    SATA physical interface specfication.  That document is
    published by the SATA-I/O committee.
