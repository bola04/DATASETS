    Earthtools sold garden ornaments including statues and large ornamental fountains for over 15 years. In addition we sold hundreds of pallets of cheap concrete balustrade and also reconstituted and carved balustrade daily. Thanks to all our customers for these years of trading. We also sold many Italian water fountains, stone gazebos, benches and much more.
