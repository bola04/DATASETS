The Analytical Lexicon lists by AB-Strong’s number, and then alphabetically, with every particular spelling of the Greek word following.  The first line of a structure begins with the part of speech of the Greek word...i.e. noun, adjective, verb, preposition, pronoun, participle, etc.  On the same line to the right of the dots is the AB-Strong number.  The first Greek word on the following line is the dictionary word, or lemma with the English word or words that appear in the Apostolic Bible after the dots.

                            ENGLISH DERIVATIVES FROM THE GREEK NEW TESTAMENT: This book was written by Charles Van der Pool the translator of The Apostolic Bible.  The word “derive”  means, “To have as a source.”  The source or root of many English words are Greek words, and  English derivatives retain a resemblance of the original Greek word in pronunciiation and spelling.  For example, the word “philosophy” is derived from two Greek words, transliterated as “philos” and “sophia.”  The word “philos”  means “friend” and “sophia” means “wisdom,” and combined they mean “friend of wisdom.”   Therefore the word “philosophy” is an English derivative from the Greek language.

                               THE CD-ROM CONTAINS TWO BIBLES: The Apostolic Bible Polyglot is one Bible and the 1709 Lambert Bos LXX is the other.  The Apostolic Bible Polyglot contains the text of both New &amp; Old Testaments, the Lexical Concordance of the Apostolic Bible Polyglot, the English-Greek Index of The Apostolic Bible Polyglot, and the Analytical Lexicon of The Apostolic Bible Polyglot.  The 1709 Lambert Bos LXX is in a scanned format, i.e. a tiff picture rendered into pdf.  It is unsearchable except for going to pages.  The AB-Bos CD ROM contains the same 66 Books of the Bible as found in The printed edition of The Apostolic Bible Polyglot.  Neither The Apostolic Bible Polylgot nor the AB-Bos CD-ROM includes the Deuterocanonicals (apocrypha).
