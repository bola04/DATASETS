         <p>
          Containers are portable, so you can put them anywhere that calls for a beauty boost.

         <p>
          Decorate your deck with multiple volleys of color and texture. Surround your pool with potted tropical plants — instant resort. Position multiple pots as dividers to plan an outdoor area. Pot up herbs on the deck for easy snipping at supper time.

           The Best Drought Tolerant Plants For Container Gardening This Summer
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Some plants perform better than others in the intensity of summer. Here are sturdy picks for your summer pots.
         </p>
         <p>
          Plant them solo for an explosion of pure color, or become creative and blend them for a bountiful mini garden in a pot.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Verbena
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          There are lots of types of verbena to choose from, all bright and easy to produce.
         </p>
         <p>
          They succeed in hot weather and endure drought. The pretty blooms love to a cascade, which makes them ideal for pots, crates and window boxes.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Canna
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Looking for a rich, tropical look for your pool or patio? Canna, with its variegated leaves and brilliant blossoms, delivers. Backlit by the sun, they positively glow.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Lantana
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Fill your pots with lantana, and you’ll quickly be best friends with butterflies. They love it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lantana offers multicolored flowers in crimson, orange, yellow, pink, and white.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Salvia
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Salvia is amazing with its indigo blue flowers, but it also holds up well to hot weather and drought. Get ready for visiting birds and butterflies.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Go For Foliage
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Worried about flowers that fade or plump up in the heat of summer?
         </p>
         <p>
          You can skip the blossoms and pack your pots with foliage plants that look perfect all season long.
         </p>
         <p>
          Go for coleus, which gives pretty leaves in a myriad of tones, often with stunning markings.
         </p>
         <p>
          Many ornamental kinds of grass look great in pots, offering graceful movement in the summer air.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sedums and succulents are popular now, and they’re famous for needing little water.
         </p>
         <p>
          Oxalis offers stunning deep purple foliage. Bonus: it flourishes well as a houseplant, too, so you can bring it in at the end of the summer and enjoy it all winter.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Herbs
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Most herbs are strong, calm and do well in pots. Some are frilly, some thin, some smooth and shiny. But their true gift is in the sniffing.
         </p>
         <p>
          Try a triad of lavender, mint and lemon thyme. Smell it, then wave goodbye to any stress.
         </p>
         <p>
          Bonus: throw them in a slaw, mix them into salsa or nuzzle them atop your barbecued chicken.

           The Care And Feeding Of Container Plants
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          How regularly to you water your containers? It depends on their capacity, location and the kinds of plants you have inside. A good rule of thumb?  Feel the soil. If the first inch is dry, water it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Give it enough water, so the whole soil ball becomes wet. You need to see how the water seeps out of the seepage holes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Containers require more watering than garden beds. All that watering makes the nutrients in the soil leach out.
         </p>
         <p>
          That means you have to replace them, through regular fertilizing. All summer long.
         </p>
         <p>
          Choose slow-release or timed release fertilizer, and small amounts of nutrients are slowly released into the soil.
         </p>
         <p>
          These products are usually mixed with the soil and will supply nutrients for three to four months.
         </p>
         <p>
          Or you can opt for a liquid fertilizer that you mix with water and apply with your regular watering, usually every two weeks.
         </p>

         <p>
          Apart from making us look good, our teeth also play the role of breaking down food into smaller pieces to ensure easier digestion. We make use of our incisors to bite the food and the canine to tear into meat, while the molars and premolars would crush the food we take in. Misalignment would affect proper digestion as our teeth are displaced. Aligning them will improve our digestion process.
         </p>

          Healthy and Strong teeth

          Alignment of your teeth plays a crucial role in strengthening them. The teeth can be strong when firmly held together. Misalignment results in a weak spot in between our teeth. Proper alignment will restore the strength of your teeth. This is why orthodontics is so essential for the proper security of the tooth.

          Now that we have that covered let’s move on to how you would safely install a muzzle brake.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Installing Muzzle Brakes
         </h3>
         <p>
          It is usually an easy task as most rifles have threads towards the end of the barrel. As long as you know that different rifles would feature different pitch threads. Read on and discover the proper installation steps:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Firstly, you need to hold your rifle the right way or lie it on the table while strong hands are holding it.
          </li>
          <li>
           Let another person unscrew the flash hider by using an open ended wrench.
          </li>
          <li>
           Newer muzzle brake models would feature a crush washer, jam nut, and peel washer. Each one would have a different function.
          </li>
          <li>
           Crush washers allow one to determine the proper alignment of the brakes.
          </li>
          <li>
           Peel washers would help in peeling off the layers of the washer to achieve a certain thickness to ensure the brakes are correctly oriented.
          </li>
          <li>
           Jam nuts are used to tighten the brakes once it’s all been aligned in a safe manner.
          </li>
         </ul>
