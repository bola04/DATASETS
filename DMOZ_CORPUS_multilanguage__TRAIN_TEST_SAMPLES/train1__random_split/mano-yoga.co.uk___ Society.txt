       Sivananda... Ashtanga...Iyengar..Power yoga .. It does not matter at all which type of Yoga you are doing!! What ever you are doing learn it properly! Tune the body..If the body is tuned ,you can go to any class and feel comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each type of Yoga has it's benefit. And each has it's weakness!! Dont ever think that your type is better!! It never is!! Dont get obsessed with the type of yoga you are learning... have an open mind... remember there is only one yoga... yoga is union with the cosmos...... Everything is tool for that goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen so many ashtanga students.... strong..but lacking flexcibility and balance!! So many iyengar students ..aligned...but lacking dynamic postures! Iyengar has Discipline, Sivananda has spiritual, ashtanga has dynamism. Take all, blend it together. That is my Yoga.
 It has discipline, It has dynamism, it is spiritual..and very very stretched..very intense..and balanced..pure raw yoga.. The way it is taught in India!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       My name is Mano. I am originally Sivananda trained yoga teacher. I teach in South London. Based in Wimbledon I did my Yoga teacher training in India in 1997. I did my advanced teacher training in 2000 in India.

       I conduct classes for beginners, 1intermediate ,and advanced students. Almost all my yoga classes are in Wimbledon.Normally I guide my students from beginners to intermediate then advanced. In All my classes the students started as beginners and now intermediate or advanced. I am an old type of yoga teacher in the tradition of indian teachers
      </p>
      <p>
       MY CLASSES ARE VERY INTENSE, VERY SWEATY! AND VERY CHALLENGING. IT IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE, RELAXING, EVERYDAY YOGA. YOU NEVER STRETCHED LIKE THIS ! YOU WILL WORK VERY HARD, YOU WILL SWEAT A LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img class="main-page-img-left" src="image-files/main-page/junko-2.png"/>
       I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE NOT FLEXIBLE, NOT STRONG, NOT FIT. I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE YOUNG OR OLD, SLIM OR BIG.  BUT WHAT I WANT IS DISCIPLINE AND A WILL TO LEARN ... I WILL TEACH ALL THE TECHNIQUES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come to my class if you want challenge, if you want new postures, if you want to sweat !!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yoga is not for once a week. It is way of life. Every day! Do little bit of breathing tchniques, little bit of meditation some sun salutation some simple postures every day..
