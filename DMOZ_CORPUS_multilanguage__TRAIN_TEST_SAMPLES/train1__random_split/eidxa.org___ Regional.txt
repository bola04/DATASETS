 /* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.
 2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.
 3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.
 4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

      as 9L1YXJ from Freetown (WW Loc. IJ38jk), informs OPDX that his
 overseas assignment is for 3 years and he has been there for 9 months
 now. Mark operates mainly on CW and the Digital modes on the HF bands
 (40-10m). He adds that he [edited] uses an "ICOM IC-7300 running 100
 watts, Chameleon EMCOMM II end-fed wire antenna in an inverted L
 configuration, with a telescopic mast up about 25’, then the rest of
 the wire out horizontally to a convenient supporting anchor. I had to
 switch to the wire antenna as we have progressed into the rainy season,
 and we do get some rather strong wind gusts and monsoon rains here in
 the tropics. Before that I was using a Chameleon mil-whip w/extension.
 That worked very well but is a portable antenna. No way it could hold
 up to the storms this time of year. The wire antenna seems to be
 holding up well so far. I am going to be ordering an Elecraft 500-watt
 amplifier and electronic antenna tuner here shortly. I hope to have
 that delivered and installed in about a month or so. Right now, I’m
 using a MFJ manual antenna tuner — it works fine but after a while it
 gets tiring and the lazy side of me wants to just hit a button to tune.
 :) With the sunspot cycle where it is I’ve only been able to make FT8
 and CW contacts with just 100 watts. Sometimes PSK31 will work from
 here. I’ve made a handful of RTTY contacts. Usually CW and FT8 most of
 the time. SSB seems pointless after many attempted QSOs to Europe that
 were very marginal at best if we could get through at all. That is why
 I was thinking the amplifier would help. My CW skills are still pretty
 basic, I can reliably manage about 13 WPM on the air. I did do my first
 ever CW contest here recently for the CQMM DX. I made over 300 contacts
 which I thought was a decent showing given my relatively low power,
 rookie operator, and slow speed. I need to find another CW contest to
 try. I’m still relatively new at operating on HF. I’ve got a lot of
 unexpected, excellent advice from hams around the world — the US, but
 also lots of help from the UK, Germany, Brazil, and Japanese operators.
 This is an amazing hobby. I’ve had FT8/JT65 QSOs from here in Freetown
 to the Falkland Islands, Iceland, Japan (lots of Japan on the long
 path), Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the West coast of
 Canada, all with my modest setup." QSL via his

 At Visalia and Dayton we had the pleasure of meeting many of our
 supporters and equipment sponsors, including: DX Engineering, Elecraft,
 SteppIR and Arlan Communications (RadioSport headsets). Several of team
 attended Europe’s Ham Radio event conducted at Friedrichshafen,
 Germany, where we met with corporate, EU club and foundation sponsors,
 many EU DXers and other DX-pedition operators.
      <br/>
      Joining the
 Pilot Team is Mason, KM4SII, from Clemmons, South Carolina. Mason, an
 avid DXer, is 15 years old. In 2017 he operated from Iceland as
 TF/KM4SII, in July 2018 he will operate from Curacao as PJ2/KM4SII.
 Mason will work with NA and Chief Pilot Glenn KE4KY.

 Rig Expert is a recognized leader in the development, production and
 global sales of antenna analyzers, transceiver interfaces, ARDF
 equipment and amateur radio software. Rig Expert donated 2 Model AA-55
 Zoom antenna analyzers to the project. We appreciate the support of our
 corporate sponsors.
      <br/>
      Our current fundraising campaign is
 underway; you may see the progress at our website. We appreciate the
 donations and equipment support we’ve already received. Our final
 payment for the Braveheart is due on September 1st. Please keep in
 mind, boat/tent/generator DX-peditions incur similar expenses whether
 or not you make a contact. Team members have booked their travel to
 meet the Braveheart at Mangareva, French Polynesia. This is not a VP6D
 project expense; each team member pays travel expenses from personal
 funds.
      <br/>
      Financial transparency allows the major sponsors to
 better understand the costs associated with a DX-pedition and how we
 spend their money. Consistent with our previous DX-peditions, we will
 send club and foundation sponsors a VP6D financial summary.
      <br/>
      We need your help to keep our DX-pedition team’s personal investment to
 a reasonable level.  Please consider making a donation at:
