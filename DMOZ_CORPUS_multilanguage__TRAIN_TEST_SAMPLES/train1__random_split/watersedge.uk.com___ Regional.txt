        While looking through our web 
 	pages we hope you will see just how wonderful staying at Water's Edge can 
 	be. Our aim is always to ensure that each and every day is very special for 
 	everyone. Attention to detail is very important to us, we are continually 
 	seeking ways to try and make things better for our valued guests. We are 
 	enthusiastic about what we do and giving our guests the best we can comes at 
 	the top of our list of priorities. Water's Edge is a truly beautiful house 
 	in a most enviable position, on the sea shore, from all our  
 	rooms there are  breath-taking views over the sea, a  garden path 
 	goes down to a pebble beach  lapped by the clear waters of the Moray 
 	Firth, it is  idyllic.... truly a once discovered, never forgotten 
 	place to stay.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our Rooms
        <br/>
        The sitting room has a charm all of its own, 
 	the  antique furnishings and a small library of interesting books, go hand in hand with flowers gathered from our 
 	sea side garden. Stepping out through the  French doors  brings you to  an enchanting small courtyard garden with a 
 	beautiful fish pond, a quiet place to relax, enjoying maybe a leisurely 
 	glass of wine. Come evening tiny lights adorn the beautiful  apple tree 
 	and  flickering candles make an unforgettably 
 	romantic scene. The dining room has a garden terrace looking out over 
 	the sea, which we call the quarter deck, breakfast  can be enjoyed here 
 	on a warm summer morning. Enjoy looking out for dolphins and otters from the 
 	dining tables through the large picture windows, always very exciting when they are spotted swimming so close 
 	to the shore.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our bedrooms
        <br/>
        All with en suite bathrooms, each with a bath and power shower 
 	offer pure luxury....wonderfully comfy beds, the finest Egyptian cotton 
 	linen, soft sparkling white towels and cosy fluffy  bathrobes and 
 				slippers. We have done our very best to ensure every moment of 
 				your stay will be as effortlessly luxurious as it can possibly 
 				be. Each bedroom has a large balcony, you can open the French 
 				doors step out onto the balcony and let the sunshine in. The 
 				spectacular view over  sea and the hills towards Culloden  is  
 				magnificent, the beauty you see outside serves to maximise the 
 				cosiness within. Dolphins are often seen from the bedroom 
 				balconies  looking  out towards Chanonry Point, drift off to 
 				sleep when the night is tranquilly calm hearing the waves gently 
 				lapping on the beach,

         The Garden
         <br/>
        </strong>
        The garden is a special place to be and to just sit awhile listening 
 			to natures own music, the soft lapping of the sea as it washes over 
 			the pebbles, dolphins are often seen from the beach at the bottom 
 			of our garden. Ships and boats sailing to and 
 			fro in Fortrose bay on  their way to Inverness harbour is a 
 			constant interest. Yachts from the Chanonry sailing club can be seen from the house, 
 			They are whisked along on breezy days. There 
 			is always a  profusion  of sea birds herons, curlews  
 			and our resident mallard ducks in the garden fly in the bay and dive through the waves. When the moon is shining 
 			on the water and the stars are shining it is a wonderful scene to 
 			cherish and warms your heart.
     		The tide 
 	greets every new day with wonderful things to explore. There are places and 
 	places and this is a great place, a slice of Scottish heaven to call your 
 	own for just a little while
 			aw 's Edge enhances the all pervading sense of 
 	peace and solitude. We promise  everyone  a genuine warm welcome and Scottish 
 	hospitality at its very best... peace, relaxation and warmth, Water's Edge 
 	is here for you to come and enjoy. We would love to welcome you to stay for 
 	just as long as you wish, sharing all the wonderful things we enjoy about 
 	living here....  It is truly special and spectacular.
