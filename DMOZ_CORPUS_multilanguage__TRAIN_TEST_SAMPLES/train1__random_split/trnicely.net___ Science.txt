    :
   </b>
   For simplicity, numbers of very large or very small
   magnitude, appearing in some documents on this site, may be written
   using the floating-point notation of FORTRAN and C. For example,
   56e15 means the same thing as 56000000000000000, 5.6*10^16,
   5.6·10^16, 5.6e16, 5.6·10
   <sup>
    16
   </sup>
   ,
   5.6×10
   <sup>
    16
   </sup>
   , etc. However, in some bibliographic references,
   such a number may be rendered in TeX style, thus: $5.6 \times 10^{16}$.
   Also, the default on this site is that K and KB equal 1000 bytes;
   M and MB equal 1000000 bytes; G and GB equal 1000000000 bytes, etc.

     DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH
    </center>
   </h3>
   Code written primarily in GNU C, and distributed asynchronously across
 available personal computers running under extended DOS, Windows, and
 GNU/Linux, is employed to enumerate primes, prime gaps, prime
 constellations (twins, triplets, and quadruplets) and their reciprocal
 sums (to extrapolate estimates for the corresponding Brun's constants).
 Some related computational results obtained by other researchers
 are also reported here.

   The following information is provided in response to numerous
     inquiries.
   <p>
    For most of the period from 1977 to 1995, I carried out design and
     development for the football simulation board games Paydirt (pro)
     and Bowl Bound (college), produced and distributed commercially
     by Avalon Hill Game Company (Baltimore, Maryland) and Sports
     Illustrated Enterprises. Commercial support of these games was
     suspended in April, 1995, and I retired from development in
     February, 1996. Avalon Hill Game Company was later acquired by
     Hasbro, Inc., and commercial design, production, and distribution
     of both games was suspended indefinitely. It appears that Hasbro
     retains the rights to both games at this time.

     Since I am not a participant or stakeholder in such operations,
     I do not accept legal responsibilty or liability for such sales
     or products.
   </p>

     (as shipped by Avalon Hill) were

     NEW LARGEST KNOWN PRIME GAP
    </center>
   </h3>
   Martin Raab has discovered a new first (and largest) known occurrence
 prime gap of measure G=6582144 following the 216841-digit
 prime P1=499973#/30030 - 4509212 (where 499973# indicates the product
 of all primes from 2 through 499973 inclusive). This gap was first
 reported by Raab on 01 July 2017. The endpoints have passed the strong
 BPSW test (Nicely, 04 September 2017) for probabilistic primality. All
 the interior integers have been demonstrated composite (18 August 2017) by
   <a href="http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=465879&amp;postcount=118">
    ATH
   </a>
   at the Mersenne Forum. A test for deterministic certification of
 primality is at present out of the question. The gap has merit M=13.182884.

     NEW PRIME GAP OF MAXIMUM KNOWN MERIT
    </center>
   </h3>
   The Gapcoin network (Jonnie Frey, developer), a Bitcoin derivative which
 employs a hashing algorithm to search for prime gaps of high merit, has
 discovered a new prime gap of maximum known merit, a gap of G=8350
 following the 87-digit prime
 P1=293703234068022590158723766104419463425709075574811762098588798217895728858676728143227.
 The merit M=G/ln(P1) of this gap is M=41.93878373153988, the largest merit
 of any known prime gap, and the first prime gap to be discovered with a
 merit exceeding 40. The endpoints of the gap have been certified as primes
 deterministically, using the Akiyama-Kida-O'Hara UBASIC implementation
 (1988-1992) of the APRCL2 test, due to Adleman, Pomerance, Rumely, Cohen,
 H. W. Lenstra, and A. K. Lenstra (1984-1987).
   <p>
    However, Bertil Nyman's maximal gap of 1132, following the prime
 1693182318746371 (discovered 24 January 1999), continues to exhibit
 the greatest known value (0.92063858855742) of the
 Cramér-Shanks-Granville ratio G/ln²(p_1); this ratio is
 0.210642105494715467 for the new Gapcoin gap. The limit superior of
 this ratio has been conjectured to be unity (or some even larger value);

     3.0.1 libraries (earlier
     versions of these packages may or may not require modifications
     of the source codes). Primary development and testing are carried
     out in the 32-bit Windows x86 environment, on 32-bit standalone
     machines with administrative privileges, using the
     <a href="http://www.mingw.org">
      MinGW/MSYS
     </a>
     compilers and
     development environment (version 28 January 2011). Any executables
     provided are native to 32-bit Windows (98SE and later). However,
     efforts are being made to maintain portability to other compilers
     and platforms, including GNU/Linux (SUSE 10.x as root user), Cygwin,
     Digital Mars, DJGPP, and Borland (version 5.51). Compatibility with
     these compilers and platforms is in some cases limited by their lack
     of support for GNU extensions, C99, C0x, GMP, MPFR, the long double
     data type, various glibc functions, the conio functions of
     DOS/DJGPP/Borland, and by non-standard interfaces to 64-bit integers.
     Support for compilers and platforms other than MinGW/MSYS/Windows
     is at an early beta stage, and will be extended in breadth and depth
     as time and resources allow. Support for MSVC, Cygwin, and 64-bit
     compilers is only at alpha level.
     <p>
      Compilation of the sources will typically require a command line
     such as
     </p>
     <pre>
     gcc xxx.c trn.c conio3.c -std=gnu99 -lm -lmpfr -lgmp -oxxx.exe
 </pre>
     where xxx.c is the name of the main source file; the exact
     command line parameters will depend upon your operating environment
     and the specific code being compiled. The support library trn.c
     (and its header trn.h), and the GMP library (4.3.1), will be needed
     for the great majority of the codes; MPFR (2.4.1) will be required
     for some applications; while the support library conio3.c (and its
     header conio3.h) will only be required if the code calls conio
     console functions (such as gotoxy, wherex, etc.) and is being
     compiled outside of DJGPP and Borland C. No makefiles are required.
     The extensions of the gnu99 standard (including most of C99) are
     used throughout these codes.
     <p>
      If you are *not* linking with GMP or MPFR, you will need to append
     the qualifiers
      <tt>
       -D__NOGMP__
      </tt>
      and/or
      <tt>
       -D__NOMPFR__

      on the command line.
     </p>
     <p>
      Note that, in general, if you wish to recompile the codes or examine
     the source code of the support routines, you will need to

       WARNING

     </u>
     : Be aware that, due to the peculiar command-line
     parsing algorithm incorporated in recent versions of Microsoft
     Windows, mathematical expressions in command lines should, to
     avoid misinterpretation, be specified within
     <u>
      double quotes

     e.g.,
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     This syntax is also valid under DOS and older versions of
     Windows, but the double quotes were optional in those
     operating environments. Depending on the programming
     language, it may also be necessary (within the source code)
     to strip off the double quotes and/or concatenate command-line
     arguments. Finally, replacing the exponentiation operator "^"
     (a particularly troublesome token for Windows) with "**" (as
     in FORTRAN/COBOL) may be helpful, if the application permits.

     , minimalist GNU for Windows.
     MinGW is a collection of freely available and freely distributable
     Windows specific header files and import libraries, combined with GNU
     toolsets that allow one to produce native Windows programs which do
     not rely on any third-party C runtime DLLs. MinGW is distributed in
     conjunction with MSYS, a Minimal SYStem (shell) providing POSIX/Bourne
     configure, make, and libtool services within 32-bit Windows. MinGW
     and MSYS together provide a scalable development environment for GCC
     applications within 32-bit Windows, with support for GMP and MPFR.
     The executables require no third-party DLLs, but are specific to the
     Win32 platform, and rely on the presence (and share some of the
     shortcomings) of certain Microsoft system DLLs (e.g., MSVCRT.DLL).
     The deficiencies of MinGW with regard to long doubles, 64-bit integers,
     and conio are partially remedied by the functions incorporated in the
     trn and conio3 libraries.

     many classic MS-DOS games completely unmodified. DOSBox has been ported
     to many different platforms, including Windows, BeOS, Linux, and Mac
     OS X. I can personally testify that DOSBox allows me to run Derive XM
     3.01, Scrabble Deluxe 1.0 (29 April 1991), and Chess88 (version 2.0,
     16 March 1984) in
