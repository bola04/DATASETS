      <p>
       The soccer goalkeeper is one of the most important players on the
 field - they are the last line of defense and the first line of attack.
 To play the position well requires special skills and training.
      </p>
      <p>
       To many coaches, though, soccer goalkeeping techniques and tactics are a
 mystery.  This is especially true at younger age levels, where often
 coaches have not played much soccer at all, much less played keeper.
 Even experienced field players and coaches may not have much experience
 with goalkeeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       This site is designed to help soccer coaches
 coach their goalkeepers.  It outlines and demonstrates
 basic soccer goalkeeping techniques and tactics, and also touches on
 the psychology of goalkeeping and provides a primer on goalkeeping
 equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Techniques and tactics will be outlined, along with
 pictures to clearly show the subject.  For some techniques, a movie
 is worth a thousand pictures, so look for the movie icon
 (
       <img alt="Movie" height="22" src="pics/movie.gif" width="20"/>
       ) to indicate a video clip.  
 You will need
       <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download">
        Quicktime
       </a>
       to view
 some of these.  There will also
 be coaching tips to help get the ideas across to players (look for
 the
       <img alt="Coaching Point" height="14" src="pics/hndarrw01d.gif" width="33"/>
       symbol), and pointers
 to common mistakes to watch for (look for
       <img alt="Mistake" height="16" src="pics/excl.gif" width="16"/>
       ).  These coaching points and mistakes
 will also be summarized at the bottom of each section.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this site will help soccer coaches be more effective in working
 with their goalkeepers and understanding the ins and outs of the position.

      <p>
       Soccer goalkeeping technique is focused on the mechanics of catching the
 ball, or at least deflecting it around the goal.  Footwork is the key,
 because if a keeper's feet can't get them to where the ball is going,
 their hands will be useless.  Catching is important, since sloppy
 catching technique can allow the ball to slip through the hands and into
 the net.  Proper positioning allows the keeper to cover the largest
 portion of the goal possible, but occasionally a desperate diving
 attempt must be made to catch or deflect difficult shots.  Finally,
 remember the goalkeeper is the last line of defense and the first line
 of attack - a keeper has to know the best way to get the ball to their
 teammates after the save has been made.
      </p>
      <p>
       These techniques are presented roughly in the order they should be taught.
 You can certainly teach them in any order, but earlier topics like
 footwork are the basis for later topics and advanced techniques will
 be much more difficult for a keeper without sound fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Goalkeeping is about safety - half is the safety of the goal; the other
 half is the safety of the goal
       <i>
        keeper
       </i>
       .  Proper goalkeeping technique is
 critical not only to keep the ball out of the net, but to keep the
 goalkeeper from getting injured.  A good technical goalkeeper is
 safe in more ways than one, thus the importance of instilling good
