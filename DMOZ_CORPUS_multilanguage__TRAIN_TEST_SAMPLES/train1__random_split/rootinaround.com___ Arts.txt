        Welcome to
        <a href="archived/index.html">
         what's left
        </a>
        of
        <b>
         Rootin' Around
        </b>
        -- a ragtag, long-defunct roots music
   review that surveyed the best (and worst) of yesterday and today's country,
   blues, juju, bluegrass, jazz, hokum, old timey, ska, rockabilly, merengue, surf and kazoo band releases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rootin' Around ceased publication -- after seven
   longwinded years -- in early 1999, in the face of overwhelming public apathy
   and industry indifference. The
   site may make an unheralded comeback someday, if its owner/publisher can ever
   get his act together and muster up something relevant to say.
