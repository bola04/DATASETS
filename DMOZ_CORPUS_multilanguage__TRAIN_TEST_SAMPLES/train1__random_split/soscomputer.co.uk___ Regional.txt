      <p>
       At SOS Computer, we help you get the most from information technology (IT). We make hardware,
                     software
                     and networks easy to use and understand. We set up and repair computers and systems, and make
                     problems
                     less likely to happen in the future. We’re friendly, we listen and we’re there when you need us.

       About Us
      </h2>
      <p>
       I’m Billy Dean, founder of SOS Computer. In my early days working for a major supermarket, I loved
                     getting to know and understand my customers. It also made it easy for me to anticipate what they
                     needed
                     – usually before they did!
      </p>
      <p>
       I took the same approach into my own company, to help you get the best possible results from digital
                     technology. It should be useful and reliable, not scary and confusing!
      </p>
      <p>
       From a home set-up with a single PC, to a smart house networked and controlled from multiple devices,
                     we’re here to help.
      </p>
      <p>
       For businesses, small or large, we provide a dedicated personal service. We have the experience and
                     skills to solve problems and give expert, professional support. And if the worst happens, we’ll make
                     sure you experience minimal disruption and get back on track quickly, without loss of precious
                     data.
      </p>
      <p>
       SOS Computer is proud to be a different kind of IT business. We spend time with our clients to help
                     them
                     learn, progress and come up with new ways to use technology. We’re knowledgeable, trustworthy and
                     friendly. We treat everyone as an individual and are very aware that no two customers’ needs are the
                     same.
      </p>

      <h4>
       Emergency on-site support
      </h4>
      <p>
       Your office computers won’t start? The network’s down? At SOS Computer, we know exactly how it feels
                     when
                     screens go blank and nothing you do will get your system going again. Don’t panic – just call us and
                     we’ll do everything we can to fix your problem quickly!
      </p>
      <p>
       Our engineers are experienced in all hardware repairs, whether you’re using PCs or Macs. We’ll come
                     to
                     your business premises – or your home, if that’s more convenient. And we can usually have your
                     system
                     up-and-running the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we need to order parts, we’ll leave you with a courtesy computer and immediately recover those
                     important files. So you can carry on working, and we’ll arrange a second visit, at your convenience,
                     to
                     complete the repair. Because we care as much about your deadlines as you do…
      </p>
      <h4>
       Remote servicing
      </h4>
      <p>
       In need of a quick computer fix? We can service your computers remotely. It’s fast, safe and
                     effective.
                     It means we don’t have to come to your premises to keep your system running smoothly, and it won’t
                     cost
                     you more for this added convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular servicing is a sound investment that prevents those scary breakdowns. Give us a call now on
       <a href="tel:+441227389911">
        <i class="fa fa-phone">
        </i>
        01227 38 99 11
       </a>
       and we’ll explain
                     how it
                     works.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Scheduled maintenance
      </h4>
      <p>
       Regular servicing helps prevent breakdowns and emergency callouts. We can organise scheduled
                     maintenance
                     to fit in with the demands of your business, with a choice of workplace visits or remote
                     servicing.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Purchasing advice
      </h4>
      <p>
       At SOS Computer we pride ourselves in giving impartial advice on the best products to buy. With
                     thousands
                     to choose from, it can be difficult to know what would most suit your business needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not leave the hard thinking and research to our technology experts? With your budget in mind,
                     we’ll find the ideal products for your needs, with no compromise in quality and performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can install and configure a complete new computer system together with all the peripherals
                     (printers,
                     scanners and other devices such as webcams and cameras).
      </p>
      <p>
       We’ll get you connected to the internet and provide you with the latest security software for your
                     safety
                     and the protection of your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we’ll transfer all files and settings from your old computer to the new one, so you can
                     resume
                     work exactly where you left off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you only need some additional equipment rather than a whole system, we’d be happy to give advice
                     and
                     set that up too.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Wireless networks
      </h4>
      <p>
       Our engineers can set up a wireless (WiFi) network and supply you with the necessary equipment if you
                     don't already have your own. We’ll connect up your PCs and allow them to share your broadband
                     connection, your documents and your printer(s).
      </p>
      <h4>
       Network infrastructure
      </h4>
      <p>
       A network infrastructure is a combination of hardware components and software applications. Our
                     engineers
                     can provide the right level of infrastructure for your business, from small-scale to high-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’ll need at least one network switch and network cables to connect all your computers and
                     printers.
                     We’ll also make sure you have the correct level of security with the use of VLANS, port-mappings and
                     firewalls. Just give us a call to discuss your needs.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Cloud computing + backup
      </h4>
      <p>
       Cloud computing may be the most reliable and cost-effective way of storing and backing-up your
                     precious
                     files, images and and other data. It involves using a network of remote servers that can hold huge
                     amounts of digital information, located at a distance, hosted on the internet and made available to
                     multiple users.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep your information “in the Cloud” by uploading it to these servers online, rather than copying
                     it
                     to a local server or servers kept in your own office or premises, which could develop faults or
                     break
                     down completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can show you the options, pricing plans, etc., and help you choose the best way of keeping your
                     precious data safe, secure and regularly backed-up.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Disaster recovery
      </h4>
      <p>
       The information you need to run your business is kept on your computer’s hard drive. If this fails,
                     or
                     ‘crashes’, and you haven’t backed up the information, it can be very bad news for your business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your system can also be attacked by viruses. A virus is a piece of malicious computer code that can
                     be
                     downloaded onto your computer and it can have a disastrous effect on your business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viruses can also be in emails pretending to come from legitimate sources, so it’s important not to
                     click
                     on any links that you do not totally trust.
      </p>
      <h5>
       Early warning signs
      </h5>
      <p>
       There are some signs that should warn you and therefore prompt you to backup your files and call us
                     in
                     before it’s too late. These signs are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a computer that is very slow to start up or takes forever to do a simple task.
       </li>
       <li>
        files are missing or become corrupt. You might even get an icon on the bottom left of the screen
                         saying that a read/write error occurred while copying some files.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sometimes data corruption is so advanced that the computer will show a blue screen and restart
                         randomly.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These signs aren’t just specific to failing hard drives. They could relate to other issues such as
                     virus
                     infections or other hardware problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to diagnose the real cause of these problems, the computer needs to be thoroughly checked
                     and
                     our experts can help you to do just that. At SOS Computer, we are experts at removing infections and
                     recovering the material from hard drives.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can remove all viruses and threats, from the easiest to the most stubborn ones. And we can check
                     the
                     security level of your computer and make the necessary changes to increase the safety and privacy of
                     your data once you go back online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a hard drive fails completely, we can save most of the data and transfer it to a brand new
                     one.
                     Techniques used will vary depending on how corrupt the drive is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If little corruption is detected then we’ll clone your old drive to a new one. Otherwise, we may have
                     to
                     transfer only critical files using more advanced tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, your files will be saved and you should have a working computer very quickly. Call us on

       and we’ll explain how it works.
      </p>
      <h4>
       PC setup
      </h4>
      <p>
       We can install and configure a new computer system together with all the peripherals (printers,
                     scanners
                     and other devices such as webcams, speakers and cameras). We’ll get you connected to the internet
                     and
                     provide you with the latest security software for your safety and the protection of your
                     computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we can transfer all files and settings from an old computer to a new one if necessary.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Purchasing advice
      </h4>
      <p>
       At SOS computer we pride ourselves in giving impartial advice on the right products to buy for your
                     home
                     PC setup. With thousands of products to choose from, it can be difficult to know what would best
                     suit
                     your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not leave the hard thinking and research to our technology experts? We’ll find the ideal
                     products
                     for your needs and budget, without compromising quality or performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you just need some additional equipment rather than a whole system, we’ll be happy to give advice
                     and
                     set that up too.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Wireless networks
      </h4>
      <p>
       We can set up a wireless (WiFi) network and supply you with the necessary equipment if you don't
                     already
                     have your own. We’ll connect your up your PC or Mac and allow them to share your broadband
                     connection,
                     printer, scanner, speakers and other peripherals. We can also provide wireless connections to any
                     outbuildings or garden structures – ideal for home offices!
      </p>
      <h4>
       Virus removal
      </h4>
      <p>
       A virus is a piece of malicious computer code that can be downloaded onto your computer. As you’re
                     browsing the Internet looking for some inspiration for your next holiday or gathering information
                     about
                     your favourite hobby, a big warning sign might pop up on your screen telling you, for example, that
                     your
                     computer has many viruses or the hard disk is about to die and you should take immediate
                     action.
      </p>
      <p>
       STOP everything: your computer has been infected with a virus (these include trojans, spyware, adware
                     and
                     ransomware). Your anti-virus programme is now probably disabled, as well as most of your computer’s
                     settings!
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people at this stage mistakenly believe that the warning sign comes from their virus protection
                     software. Unfortunately, they follow the instructions on screen and give away many personal details
                     including their credit card number. They’ll obviously get charged by the rogue software and, worse
                     than
                     that, might get their credit card cloned or be victims of identity theft.
      </p>
      <p>
       At SOS Computer, we are experts at removing such infections, and many more. For a set fee, we’ll
                     remove
                     all viruses and threats, from the easiest to the most stubborn ones. We’ll check the security level
                     of
                     your computer and make the necessary changes to increase the safety and privacy of your data once
                     you go
                     back online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Viruses can also be in emails pretending to come from legitimate sources, so it’s important not to
                     click
                     on any links that you do not totally trust.

       Smart Tech
      </h3>
      <h4>
       What does it mean?
      </h4>
      <p>
       Smart tech provides a home, office or other building with advanced, automated systems that give users
                     control over the functions in that space. For example, a smart home might have appliances such as
                     TVs,
                     computers, security and camera systems, and services, such as lighting and heating, that can
                     communicate
                     with each other. And they can all be monitored and controlled by voice, remote control, tablet or
                     smartphone, from inside or outside the house.
      </p>
      <p>
       Systems like Google Home, Apple HomeKit and Nest will work with certain appliances but not others.
                     And
                     there are other issues such as data sharing and privacy that you should consider.
      </p>
      <h4>
       What do I need?
      </h4>
      <p>
       It depends on the level and number of activities you want to control and how much you want to spend.
                     And
                     it also depends on whether you are making gradual changes to an existing building or starting from
                     scratch with a new or remodelled one. So you can start by connecting just one or two suitable
                     appliances
                     and adding more as you go, or you can go full-on Futurama and have everything that smart tech can
                     currently provide (the robots aren’t quite there yet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We can audit your space to check which systems would be best for you now, taking on board your needs,
                     budget and future plans for smart living. And we’ll give you expert advice on purchase and
                     installation.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Setup and use
      </h4>
      <p>
       We offer a full installation service; we’ll also fully check your new system and show you how to get
                     the
                     most from it.
