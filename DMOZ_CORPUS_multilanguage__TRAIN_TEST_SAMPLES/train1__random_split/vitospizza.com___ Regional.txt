Our patrons aren’t just customers, they are family and friends, and our restaurants are the place they come back to week after week and year after year. This family has allowed Vito’s to continue the tradition of fantastic, homemade Italian food for well over 30 years and counting! 
 From pizza to pasta to seafood, Vito’s has it all. Offering unique food for both lunch and dinner. It doesn’t matter if you’re craving bruschetta, filet mignon, or risotto; Vito’s entire menu is “seasoned with laughter and spiced with love.”  All the pasta is homemade and the veggies fresh and straight from local gardens. We’re sure you’ll find something you’ll love on the menu!
 Vito’s Scottsdale location is housed on scenic N. Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard, right down the road from Cholla Park. For the Mesa Italian lovers, Vito’s Mesa location, celebrating over thirty years in business, is located on North Lindsay Road. No matter the location you choose, either way you’ll be getting a wonderful atmosphere and even better food.
 And night after night, bite after bite, the happy sounds of people laughing and chatting in between bites of the
     <strong>
      best pizza in Scottsdale &amp; Mesa, AZ
     </strong>
     and sips of our special chianti reassures us that the mission of Vito and JoAnne is still being fulfilled after 30 years and makes us look forward to what the next 30 years will bring!
