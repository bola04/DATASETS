        History
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wright Rain was founded over 50 years ago by Jack Wright to supply irrigation equipment to the agricultural industry, initially manufactured on his own farm. Under Jack’s innovative and pioneering leadership the company grew dramatically over the next two decades. With the building of a specialist factory on adjoining land, we secured many large overseas contracts for the design, manufacture and installation of irrigation systems, which were undertaken in many developing countries, especially in sub- Saharan Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wright Rain factory was equipped with the latest manufacturing plant available at that time, for foundry production of aluminium and bronze castings, and automatic turning machines for sprinkler components and assembly. This was soon followed by a testing station which could measure the water distribution of sprinklers with different nozzle combinations and pressures under controlled conditions, thus ensuring accurate data was available to determine the optimum spacings for the high quality sprinklers that became the hallmark of Wright Rain. We then installed PVC extrusion plants, which enabled us to produce PVC pressure pipes up to 6" diameter for underground mains, followed by aluminium seam welding process lines for portable aluminium pipes up to 8" diameter. Tractor PTO, diesel engine and electric motor driven pump units were also designed and built in our factory at Ringwood.
