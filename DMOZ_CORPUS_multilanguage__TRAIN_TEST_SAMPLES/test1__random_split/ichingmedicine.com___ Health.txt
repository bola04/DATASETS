               These energetic anatomical correlation is reflection 
             of the Ba Gua, where each correlation gives balance to the other. 
             For instance, if we treat the knee, it balances the elbow. There is 
             an energetic correlation between all parts of the body like internal 
             pathways connecting organs to channels. In the Balancing 
             Methodology, one needle is often used to balance the energy of the 
             opposing area, which produces immediate relief of the stagnation or 
             pain.
