           ACHP Issues Amendments to Program Comment for GSA Select Repairs and Upgrades
          </strong>
          <br/>
          In late July, via an unassembled meeting vote,  the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) issued amendments to the  Program Comment for the General Services Administration (GSA). As before, the  Program Comment sets forth the way in which GSA will comply with Section 106 of  the National Historic Preservation Act for select repairs and upgrades to  windows; lighting; roofing; and heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning  (HVAC) systems within historic public buildings. A model federal agency  alternative pursuant to Section 800.14(e) of the ACHP’s regulations, the  Program Comment continues to streamline select review protocols for GSA,  facilitating their execution of repair and upgrade projects. The amendments  extend the Program Comment’s term for 15 years and adjust reporting  requirements.

           First Public Playground’s Founder Showcases National Parks and Rec Month
          </strong>

          <img align="left" alt="Hull House Playground 1895, Jane Addams Memorial Collection, Department of Special Collections, The University Library, The University of Illinois at Chicago" height="171" hspace="3" src="hull.jpg" title="Hull House Playground 1895, Jane Addams Memorial Collection, Department of Special Collections, The University Library, The University of Illinois at Chicago" vspace="3" width="182"/>
          Commemorate National Parks and Recreation Month by celebrating Hull House, the site of the first public playground in Chicago and the various educational and social welfare programs established by Nobel Peace Prize recipient Jane Addams. Addams was born on September 6, 1860, in Cedarville, Illinois. After graduating from Rockford Female Seminary and touring Europe, Addams returned home to care for her sister and volunteer with the elderly and orphaned children. In 1887, Addams visited Toynbee Hall in London, the world’s first settlement house, and was inspired by the institution’s educational and social services to the poor.
         </p>
         <p class="style6">
          Addams returned to her home state of Illinois and, along with her friend Ellen Gates Starr, opened Hull House in Chicago’s Nineteenth Ward in 1889. Hull House was originally built in 1856 by Charles J. Hull. Addams intended Hull House to serve the poorest communities of Chicago, particularly the city’s large immigrant community. Among its many offerings, Hull House provided a school for children, language, cooking, and music classes, athletics, reading groups, youth clubs, an art studio, and a library. In 1893 Hull House opened the city’s first public playground, which was later managed by the City Playground Commission.
         </p>
         <p class="style6">
          Today Jane Addams is celebrated as a pioneer of social reform. Hull House was in operation until 1963, when it became the Jane Addams Hull House Museum. Hull House was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1965 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 following the enactment of the National Historic Preservation Act.

          In September 2018 the Historic Charleston Foundation will launch a Preservation app. This free app will offer updated and expanded tours of two house museums (Aiken-Rhett and Nathaniel Russell) as well as a comprehensive guide to the entire city of Charleston. The house museum tours will feature new research and findings at both houses, an expanded narrative focused on the lives of the enslaved, and interviews with local and national experts about archaeology, African American history, paint analysis, and historic interiors. The city guide encompasses 30 audio stops and more than 350 points of interest across the peninsula. It aims to tell the forgotten and overlooked history of Charleston together with the preservation history of the ever-evolving city. Many visitors mistakenly think the built environment looks this way by accident, or because residents were too poor to repair their houses after the Civil War. The app will tell the story of the generations of people who have devoted themselves to preserving Charleston, as well as highlight current issues and ongoing ideological battles. Keep your eyes on the app store! Learn more about the Historic Charleston Foundation and its director of museums Lauren Northup in the ACHP’s Preservationists In Your Neighborhood Series:

          A  key to successful Section 106 consultation is inviting interested parties to  the table as early as possible in the process. However, sometimes sound  research is needed to determine which Indian tribes have an interest in the  project area. A new source of information to aid in the process is the

           ACHP Chairman Highlights Benefits of Historic Tax Credit in Letter to Congress
          </strong>
          <br/>
          As Congress weighs various proposals for tax reform, ACHP Chairman Milford Wayne Donaldson has asked the House Ways and Means Committee to consider the past success and future potential of the federal historic rehabilitation tax credit.
          <a href="docs/ACHP Comments on HTC and Tax Reform.pdf" target="_blank">
           Read his letter here.
          </a>
         </p>
         <p class="style6">
          Since 1976, more than 41,000 projects throughout the U.S. have benefited from the tax credit, generating $78.3 billion in investment and creating nearly 2.4 million jobs. The credit also pays for itself, with the $23.1 billion cost of the program offset by the $28.1 billion in tax receipts generated by projects receiving the credit.
         </p>
         <p class="style6">
          One tax reform plan under consideration in Congress calls for elimination of most special-interest deductions and credits. In his letter to the chairman and ranking member of the committee, Donaldson noted that the 20 percent historic tax credit does not support a specific industry or locality, but it encourages the renovation of underutilized commercial properties for a wide range of uses in communities throughout the country.

           The ACHP is pleased to announce the availability of its voluntary Electronic Section 106 Documentation Submittal System (e106) for use by any federal agency (or officially delegated non-federal entity) when notifying the ACHP of a finding of adverse effect, inviting the ACHP to be a consulting party to resolve adverse effects, or proposing to develop a Programmatic Agreement for complex or multiple undertakings.

          The e106 system is designed to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of the Section 106 review process by providing federal agencies with an electronic submittal system that serves to expedite a critical step in Section 106 review and encourage complete and accurate submissions that can be shared with others.

           Brownsville, Texas, uses Preserve America Money to Spark Downtown Development
          </strong>
          <br/>
          At one of Texas’s most famous border towns, Brownsville has turned its once vacant and abandoned Downtown into a visitor’s mecca. Using its expansive supply of historic resources that just needed a little boost, the city now has four times the visitorship compared to a decade ago. Preserve America Grant funding of $132,870 helped spark the work to make downtown Brownsville a successful cultural tourist destination.
