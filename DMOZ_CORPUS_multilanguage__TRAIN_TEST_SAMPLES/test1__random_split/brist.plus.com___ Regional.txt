         If you have diabetes, understanding how diabetes can affect you could greatly help in controlling your diabetes.
  The options in your control like diet and exercise really can make a large difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you don't have diabetes;
  factors like being over weight, taking little exercise, 
  having close relatives with diabetes and poor diet all make you you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
