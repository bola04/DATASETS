    I grew up in Needham, Massachusetts but spent most of my High-School years at the
     DeSisto Schools in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and Howie-in-the-Hills, Florida. I then
     went to Northeastern University in Boston, majoring in Electrical Engineering. I
     was a principal at a company called Optical Access International, and later founded

    <img align="right" alt="Work" border="0" src="images/work.gif"/>
    One of the loves of my life
     has always been computers. I have been doing hardware and software work since I was
     11 - and had be first contract software job when I was 12! I started on the old Apple
     ][+, and then the PDP-11, and moved into bigger and better things over the years. I
     have done a ton of various stuff - a lot of PDA stuff (my most popular working being
    <a href="http://www.pdatoolbox.com/">
     PDA Toolbox
    </a>
    - and some
    <a href="/blackberry/">
     Blackberry shareware
    </a>
    . These days, I focus mainly on things
     like embedded systems, Kernel-level, Linux, device drivers, etc. I guess it's the
     control-freak in me that likes to stay down at the lowest level of things where your
     not relying on anything underneath you that you don't have control over. By the same token, I do a lot of very "high" level work with things like AJAX, JavaScript, etc - though mostly as a 
 means to control/monitor/interact with my lower-level stuff.  Granted, one of the coolest projects I did was collecting and importing all the FAA and Military US airspace databases 
 into a system I integrated with Google Maps - it draws airspaces rings, dynamically creates airport
    <b>
     correct
    </b>
    airport icons, etc. (It's not available on this site, 
 because of the size of the databases. It's on my home server though, drop me a line if you want to see it. A version of it with a subset of the functionality is
    <a href="http://www.bradgoodman.com/airnav/">
     here
    </a>
    )
   </p>
   <p>
    I am very
     cross-functional between hardware and software engineering - so I also like to be at
     the level where I can work in both domains. I have been the Chief Technology Officer
     and founder of a couple companies, Optical Access Internationa and
    <img align="bottom" alt="Logo" src="images/citaname.gif"/>
    for about 10 years. We made some
     phenominal products - very small, high-powered NAS controllers (pictured on right,)
     SCSI-to-IDE controllers, and things of the such. In 2000 when the whole market dried
     up and we ran out of money and went out of business. (You live, you learn...) I have pretty much stayed in the Storage space through my whole career, (I can't escape it!) So
     thenwent to work at Storigen systems - and when they vaporized to
    <a href="http://www.acopia.com/">
     Acopia Networks
    </a>
    . I then worked at
    <a href="http://www.empirix.com/">
     Empirix
    </a>
    working on VoIP test equipment on
     Linux and at
    <a href="www.schange.com/">
     SeaChange International
    </a>
    , who makes broadcast and cable-TV video products, working primarily in their storage and Video-On-Demand division.
   </p>
   I am now at
   <a href="http://www.emc.com/">
    EMC
   </a>
   (which is now Dell/EMC - part of
   <a href="http://www.dell.com">
    Dell
   </a>
   ) where I work on a bunch of new "next generation" data storage products (I can't talk about), focusing on system, platform, performance, Kernel, Datapath, Flash, RDMA, hardware and virtualization, among some other stuff..
   <p>
    I've put together a small

    I've
     developed over the years if you want to take a look.

     <img align="left" alt="Brad flying Warrior" border="0" src="BradPlane.jpg"/>
    </a>
    One of my main passions is
     aviation. Wether it's flying actual planes, building, flying and designing model planes and helicopters, building a full-sized flight simulator in my basement - I love all of it!
   </p>
   <p>
    <img align="right" src="hornet/HornetPhoto5.jpg"/>
    Well...almost all of it. There is of course the fact that I am absolutley terrified of flying! So much so that I have not been in a
    <i>
     commercial
    </i>
    plane in about ten years! On the flipside of this is the fact that I am working on my Pilot's License. Needless to say - the hardest part of this has been overcoming my fear of flying - which I hope will pass. You can view some maps and GPS tracks of my flights
    <a href="/airnav/">
     here

    - (a nifty page I created with Google Maps to overlay airport/airspace data and GPS tracks.)

   You can also check out

     the

    Hornet
   </a>
   helicopter. Another big pasttime of mine was Palm
     software development. I have been out of it for a while, but have several very
     popular titles which are of my creation. It is a pretty cool feeling when you can go
     into any bookstore and find yourself written up in several books! You can see my
   <a href="../palmpilot/">
    Palm Software Here

   . I now use a Blackberry as my phone/PDA and have several popular titles available for it.

    I have a collection of
     photos of friends and family online, but it is pretty small. I just got a scanner and
     am in the process of augmenting my online collection! I am also very into Bonsai
     gardening, and have had several plants under my care for many years. Some plants I
     grew from "scratch", transplanting them from another tree. I dont have any pictures
     of my Bonsais yet - although I think they are in the background of some of the photos
     with Bear and Moose.

     <img align="left" alt="Bear &amp; Moose" border="0" height="78" src="bearmoose_sm.jpg" width="120"/>

    I have a stuffed
    <a href="http://www.bradgoodman.com/bear/">
     Bear
    </a>
    and a stuffed
    <a href="http://www.bradgoodman.com/moose/">
     Moose
    </a>
    , both of which I am quite fond of.
     Its a long story - Kathryn bought me the Moose for christmas one year - it was more
     of a decoration on the wrapping of another present, or a stocking stuffer. (He is
     only about 4 inches tall!) I grew too attached to him, so she bought the Bear to keep
     Moose company, so I wouldn't pay so much attention to him! It backfired and now I pay
     too much attention to both of them! We call them
    <a href="flanimals/">
     <em>
      flanimals
     </em>
    </a>
    because the are made of flannel. They each
     have their own pages where you can see some of their antics!
