   We've detected a nefarious "bot" or "spider" coming from your IP address, and are now blocking 
 	that address for a period of time to protect our websites. You may want to make sure that you 
 	are running updated antivirus, updated antispyware, and a two-way firewall, that notifies you 
 	when a program on your computer is using your internet connection without your permission.
