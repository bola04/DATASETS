         The Centre was established in 1990 when it was converted from a late Victorian Stables.  It is sponsored by the Sisters of St Louis, an international community of women religious.  Whilst rooted in Christianity, the Centre respects and welcomes diversity and is a meeting place for people of many spiritual traditions.

        <p class="style1">
         We are conveniently close to the centre  of Newmarket, a small Suffolk town whose character is strongly  coloured by the horse-racing industry.  Although less than 5 minutes walk from Newmarket High Street, the Centre  is in a quiet, green space. There is a  small woodland, a garden and grassy paddock with an expanse of open heathland  close by. Breckland, with one of the  largest forests in England  is a 25 minute drive, as are Cambridge and the Fens with their quiet waterways and great skies.
