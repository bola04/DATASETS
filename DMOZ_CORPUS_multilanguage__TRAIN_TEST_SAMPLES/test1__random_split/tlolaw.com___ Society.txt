        Immigration Attorney Making a Difference in the Lives of His Clients
       </h3>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Hamilton County Herald, Friday, April 06, 2012
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Each day, immigration attorney Terrence Olsen moves mountains for his clients. 
  				Whether he’s providing pro bono services to an agency that brings refugees into 
  				the country, or removing the international barriers that separate a husband and 
  				wife, or helping a foreign entity set up operations in the U.S., he’s simply 
  				doing his job. But as he takes phone calls, sends emails and attends meetings, 
  				he’s also moving his own mountain.

        The film
        <em>
         If There Is A Way
        </em>
        is about a married couple
  				from the small African nation of Burundi who fled from their war-torn country in 
  				1972. In 2007, they were relocated to America, but had their children left behind 
  				in refugee camps. This is a short film about their experiences in Africa, America, 
  				and their hope to see their children once more.

        The overall issues facing the Olsen Law Firm as an immigration law firm have 
 					been how to operate and develop in a social and economic climate in which new 
 					immigration laws and policies are being introduced monthly and are greatly 
 					increasing the scrutiny of nonimmigrants and immigrants in the U.S..  
 					With this said, the Olsen Law Firm views its own image as a firm from a local, 
 					national, and international level. Therefore, the Olsen Law Firm attempts to 
 					communicate through its relationships via its work product, its clients, and 
 					the greater community by demonstrating that the world is a much smaller place 
 					and so by working and living and treating each other with consistency and 
 					respect then all matters social, economic, and cultural can be both enjoyable 
 					and positive.
