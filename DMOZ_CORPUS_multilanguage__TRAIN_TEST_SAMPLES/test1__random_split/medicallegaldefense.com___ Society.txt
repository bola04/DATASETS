       <h4>
        An Honest Doctor
       </h4>
       <p>
        In May 1988 James Johnson, M.D. started in medical practice.
   Contrary to many people's assumptions, not all doctors earn high salaries.
   James always has been an upstanding doctor of moderate means who took pride
   and pleasure in doing his utmost, through traditional and nontraditional medicine,
   to serve patients who sought his help. Nontraditional (alternative or complementary)
   medical methods can be in the form of acupuncture, massage, meditation, herbs,
   aromatherapy, and more.
       </p>
       <p>
        In James' case, he was asked
     to provide and did provide herbal therapy, which was the absolute best that
     he could give based upon his years of study and practice in both traditional
     and nontraditional medicine. As you may know, many herbal therapies stem
     from documented knowledge of plants and methods used effectively by Native
     Americans for many centuries. Also, medicine is not a finite science and
     patients rarely have guarantees; what works for one person may not work for
     another, and one person's body may fail to respond, or react negatively,
     to a drug or other therapy that worked for someone else. Patients should
     enter therapy with such an understanding and must follow the doctor's instructions
     exactly.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Wrongly Accused
       </h4>
       <p>
        Despite James’ best efforts and dedication to the Hippocratic Oath, he has
   been accused of malpractice by the state and stripped of the ability to practice
   medicine, the occupation to which he has devoted his life. All because he did
   what he was trained and trusted to do. Where in that lies justice for an honest
   doctor, especially one of moderate means?
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr. Johnson's medical license
     was suspended in June 2000 and revoked that November. The "reason," as
     quoted by the medical board: "Unprofessional, unethical, dishonorable
     conduct; gross malpractice; offered, undertook, or agreed to cure or treat
     a disease, injury, ailment, or infirmity by a secret means, method, device
     or instrumentality." Truly, neither the description nor the punishment
     is fitting.

       <h4>
        James Fully Complied With The Law
       </h4>
       <p>
        In accordance with that suspension, Dr. Johnson
   himself immediately stopped providing medical care to patients. He hired licensed
   doctors to provide needed, ongoing care for patients and confined his activities
   to managing the non-medical portion of the business, which he ultimately had
   to close. To show genuine compliance with the law, he explained
   this arrangement in a February 2001 letter to the Assistant General Counsel,
   Department of Health.
       </p>
       <h4>
        Cleared By One Court, Indicted By Another
       </h4>
       <p>
        Then, a pleasant surprise: In the fall of 2001 a court declared that the November
   2000 medical board decision was in error. Despite that second ruling and his
   compliance, Dr. Johnson was indicted later in 2001 on a charge of "impersonation
   of a licensed professional for offense occurring 12/01/2000 to 12/31/2000" (Case
   # 2001-B-734). However, the legal system did not notify him; he knew nothing
   about this charge until a warrant arrived for his arrest in the fall of 2002.
   Imagine his shock! He, his patients, and other doctors in the community do
   not understand why such a charge has been levied against him.
