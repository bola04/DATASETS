      The high standards of containment and manufacture of our glove boxes, and the use 
               of sophisticated handling facilities as required by the nuclear 
               industry, have provided a quality and design base upon which the 
               company has taken its products into chemistry, medical, pharmaceutical, 
               research of materials and welding, with a variety of innovative 
               applications.

      The success of Glove Box Technology is founded upon specialisation 
               and a thorough understanding of our technology. This enables us 
               to devote our total attention to the creative development of inert 
               gas glove boxes and containment, normally Nitrogen, Argon or Helium, 
               and the management of that environment to low levels of contamination, 
               typically but not exclusively, oxygen and/or moisture to below 1 
               part per million.
