         <p>
          I have been writing my Student Trucker Story on “
          <a href="http://www.askthetrucker.com" target="_blank" title="Ask the Trucker">
           Ask the Trucker
          </a>
          ” since October 2008.
         </p>
         <p>
          Although by October I was in a much different situation because I had moved from the “Team Division” into a Dedicated Solo Fleet beyond the ridiculously unsafe situations my company placed me in during my training.
         </p>
         <p>
          In this new division I saw very quickly how things
          <em>
           should
          </em>
          be done. The entire manner of my new fleet was more effective because the communication and professionalism was much better. Partially because the contract DEMANDS it or the contract will be lost.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was also driving solo finally, not required to drive &amp; live with someone from unknown origins.

         In 2009, I was labeled an “advocate”. It wasn’t my intention to make my life more complicated, but I felt obligated to expose poor truck driver training since it affects everyone on the highway.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2010, the protest group
         <a href="https://www.facebook.com/REALWomeninTrucking/?ref=bookmarks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          REAL Women in Trucking, Inc.
         </a>
         on Facebook was formed by working women truck drivers. Today, the

         </a>
         that continues to be outspoken on issues that affect drivers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sexual misconduct in training carriers, and the lack of safe truck parking have been the two primary issues that I personally have become most passionate. I will be forever humbled to call Hope Rivenburg my friend and to have been part of the “
         <a href="http://www.jhlrivenburg.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          Jason’s Law
         </a>
         ” truck parking coalition. The tragic murder of her Husband Jason Rivenburg which spurred her relentless pursuit of justice and started a movement, motivated many individuals like myself. Today, a growing number of grassroots truck driver advocates continue to work towards bringing exposure to issues that must be addressed in this industry.

         During these past 10 years, I also became a Grandmother four more times, for a total of SIX!
        </p>
        <p>
         Plus, I graduated from College , formed REAL Women in Trucking into a 501 (c)(6) non profit, started a master’s degree program

         Initially, I had no desire to be self-employed in trucking. I only wanted to have a job where I could work by myself, get my paycheck every Friday and have some decent benefits. I have never had an interest in office politics or clawing my way up any corporate ladders.

         ” I spent a couple years doing local driving to get a better understanding of what it takes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I quickly found that the better paying jobs are very hard to get a foot in the door, even with a clean driving record, there are many places that will ignore your application when the name on the paper is that of a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was able to overcome this type of discrimination by getting hired on at a truck driver staffing agency. I did everything from local food delivery to flatbed work. I learned a lot and worked very hard. Often when I was sent on a short -term assignment, they were not expecting a woman, but they were happily surprised by my work ethic and I was welcomed to return. Through this method, I was able to learn a lot about local driving jobs and I was offered several full-time positions that I would otherwise not have been considered for if I had relied on the standard hiring practices. Local work is hard! , it is often twice the work for less pay. I hand unloaded everything from imported specialty cheeses to cactus plants. I enjoyed the movement of the work, but it was hard on my body, and … I missed being out on the road.

          Long story short, I got pushed over a cliff and I found out I could fly!

          This was a significant moment!
         </strong>
         To arrive with Hope Rivenburg (
         <a href="http://jhlrivenburg.com/cgi/wp/" target="_blank">
          Jason’s Law
         </a>
         ) at the OOIDA Headquarters for the final of four regional truck parking coalition meetings held on October 5, 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you have followed this blog and my social media activity over the past 8 years you will know just how many twists and turns my journey into the trucking industry has taken. Truck parking came to my attention through twitter when an article about a murdered truck driver named Jason Rivenburg was shared with me by a friend I met through social media that had a small Virginia newspaper.
        </p>
        <p>
         Shortly afterwards I came to know Hope Rivenburg and felt blessed that I could help share news of her campaign to create a safe truck parking bill named after her Husband Jason.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the years watching this movement transition from a heartbroken family gathering petition signatures at their local country fair to the day Hope texted me during her first trip to Washington D.C. saying she wished she wore flat shoes because it was “
         <em>
          <strong>
           …much bigger than she thought it was…
          </strong>
         </em>
         “, I have been inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
         One person
         <em>
          <strong>
           CAN
          </strong>
         </em>
         make a difference! Hope Rivenburg is proof of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         The series of truck parking coalition meetings brought together people who would normally not sit at the same table and have a conversation. I found that there were vast differences in the beginning in understanding terminology between the groups but I felt optimistic following each meeting that
         <em>
          <strong>
           most
          </strong>
         </em>
         of the people in attendance wanted to identify ways to solve the problem of truck parking shortages.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say “
         <em>
          <strong>
           most
          </strong>
         </em>
         ” since there were some stakeholders that were absent and should have been represented in these meetings such as the shippers and receivers who dictate strict schedules, representatives from the freight brokerage sector and the trucking carriers of large fleets where drivers have very little experience in locating truck parking outside of their designated fuel stop locations.

         <strong>
          Do you know that there were only two individuals (2) that attended all four (4) meetings for truck parking?
         </strong>
         I was one (1) of those people. The other person was Mr. Carl Rundell from “
         <a href="http://trucksmartparkingservices.com/" target="_blank">
          Truck Smart Parking Services
         </a>
         “.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the absence of some of the major stakeholders,  I was pleased to meet several representatives from the National Association of Truck Stop Owners (NATSO) and be able to better understand where they are coming from with their arguments and statements about truck drivers and trip planning. It was clear that there has been a lack of communication to partner industries in the supply chain when it comes to the needs of the individuals that serve this country each and every day in their work as truck drivers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Joyce Hibma, the Wife of a truck driver has become an instrumental voice for drivers in the North Bend, Washington truck parking battle. She attended the Salt Lake City coalition with me as a REAL Women in Trucking Mission Support Member. This is a woman who herself is on a mission and she is to be commended for her hard work on behalf of drivers. In Salt Lake City, Joyce and I met Lisa Mullings from NATSO and Caroline Boris Research Analyst from ATRI ( American Transportation Research Institute ).
        </p>
        <p>
         At the Maryland and Dallas Meetings, Idella Hansen RWIT Treasurer and Pat Hockaday from “
         <a href="http://www.truckersunited.org/" target="_blank">
          Truckers United
         </a>
         ” attended the coalition meetings which helped place more drivers in the room in order to give real life perspective to solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lisa Mullings CEO of NATSO remarked during the final meeting at OOIDA Headquarters “
         <em>
          <strong>
           Where are the carriers in this conversation? They call themselves “Logistics” companies and they are dictating fuel stops and highway routing in the bigger carriers, Why aren’t they helping their own drivers with parking?
          </strong>
         </em>
         ”
        </p>

         It is a great question and observation since these issues will get worse when mandated ELD’s come to fruition.

         The truth is that the inexperienced driver population is more likely to park on highway ramps because they are being run to the minute with their e-logs and many of these drivers do not have knowledge on truck parking outside their fuel routing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another issue that emerged was trucking fleets that only fuel at one chain that notoriously does not construct enough truck parking for the area in need which then in turn pushes off overflow to other chains who do not benefit from fuel sales. Pilot Travel, specifically, the “
         <em>
          <strong>
           fuel your truck and get out
          </strong>
         </em>
         ” chain vs. Travel Centers of America, a chain that generally has a larger area to park but not so much a place fleet drivers are authorized to fuel at their locations.
         <strong>
          What are the reasons for this?
         </strong>
         Only major carriers can answer this question and drivers can only speculate. This is why carriers should have been part of these discussions.

         The truck parking shortage is a problem that still has obstacles and that is where

         Essentially, we are in a place where despite all of the great ideas that emerged from the four regional truck parking coalition meetings there remains an obstacle. Communities that protest new truck parking that have not been sold on how safe truck parking serves them.

          Here is what you need to know

         and how you can help work toward educating your state freight planners. Currently, All of the states have been tasked by the Federal government to do something they have never been required to do in the past, that is to create a freight plan.

          States must have an approved freight plan and freight network in place by December 2017 in order to continue to use their freight formula funds that were made available in

          You can also help by calling State Motor Carrier Associations to make sure they understand that truck parking is an eligible project and asking them if they know “

           What’s in the freight plan?
          </strong>

         <li>
          If possible, get involved in State and MPO area freight advisory committees.

          Final Advice:
         </strong>
         Persist with your state by asking the question: “
         <strong>
          What is in your freight plan?
         </strong>
         ” be tenacious but polite about getting answers.

          REMEMBER!
         </strong>

         <strong>
          Stop waiting for everyone else to make a difference for YOU!

          LAKE WORTH, Fla. (August 16, 2016) –
         </strong>
         REAL Women in Trucking, Inc. (RWIT) is hosting a conference aboard the Carnival Conquest to unite and honor women in the truck driving industry. The “Queen of the Road on the High Seas”
         <a href="http://www.realwomenintrucking.com/1st-annual-lady-truck-driver-cruise/">
          conference
         </a>
         , taking place Sunday, March 26 to Saturday, April 1, 2017, will include education sessions on a broad range of topics, including personal safety, discrimination, sexual harassment, and driver health. The agenda also includes a driver advocacy forum, a lady truck driver roundtable and an awards ceremony recognizing women who have overcome obstacles in the truck driving industry. The six-night cruise will depart from Ft. Lauderdale for the Eastern Caribbean with stops at Grand Turk, Dominican Republic and Nassau.
        </p>
        <p>
         The conference will provide tools for truck drivers while advancing a voice for RWIT and its members. The sessions will include information on improving technical skills for drivers, promoting advocacy through social media, transitioning company drivers to owner-operator, and much more. A forum of truck driver advocates will also discuss issues that affect the industry. Notable speakers include Allen Smith, host of ‘Ask the Trucker;’ Anne Balay, published author of
         <em>
          Steel Closets: Voices of Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Steelworkers
         </em>
         , a former truck driver, and writer of a recent op-ed published in The New York Times “Long-Haul Sweatshops;” and Christine Gray, Becca Kennedy and Shannon Morris, truck drivers, and advocates for the safety and success of women truck drivers.
        </p>

         “This conference is important to our efforts of ‘breaking the silence’ about the treatment of women in the trucking industry.” said Desiree Wood, one of RWIT’s founders. “At the conference, we hope to provide the tools women need to be more successful in their chosen field.  Along with information sessions, participants will have the opportunity to network with fellow drivers. Learning from one another and unifying on important issues is one of our primary goals.”
        </p>
        <p>
         RWIT was initially formed in 2010 as a 501(c)(6) membership organization by female truckers to protest poor conditions that were not being effectively addressed by the trucking industry. “Queen of the Road on the High Seas” is the organization’s first fundraising event. Proceeds will help establish a 501(c)(3) foundation which will provide a headquarters and facilities with modest truck parking availability for members, scheduled learning conferences and advanced training for entry-level driver training students to develop their skills.

           We learned between 2009 and 2013 that Facebook posts and Twitter posts directly to elected officials pages could elicit a response since these posts are public and ignoring them is bad social media etiquette (manners).

           Unfortunately elected officials do not want to hear from people that are not their constituents (people whose votes affect them) through their websites and office lines.

          What do you think?
         </strong>
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Would it be okay with you if people just learning to drive, that held only a learners permit and who had little to zero highway experience, could legally operate an 80,000 lb. vehicle for work in a 24/7 operation while their “on-the-job” instructor slept and was not sitting in the front passenger seat to observe and teach them?
        </p>
        <p>
         That is a pretty scary thought, isn’t it?
        </p>
        <p>
         Unknowingly to many, this is exactly what is happening within the trucking industry
         <strong>
          TODAY
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Does it sound safe to you?
         </strong>
         Whether the learners permit holder is a teenager, a newly licensed adult or a commercial learner permit (CLP) holder, a written test is all that an individual is required to pass in order to receive any kind of learner’s permit. It is only a permit to learn the driving portion requirements for the designated license with an instructor; it does not signify the ability or aptitude to drive. While a finals skills test is the ticket for a CLP holder to become a commercial driver’s license (CDL) holder, it does not mean that the individual actually knows how to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) moving real paying freight loads on the open highway.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Background on CDL training for CMV drivers:
         </strong>
         <br/>
         For over 20 years, many within the trucking industry have been seriously concerned about the entry level training standards for CMV drivers. The
         <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/" target="_blank">
          Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
         </a>
         (FMCSA), which is the regulating body over the trucking industry has also recognized that there is a lack proper training standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2014 the FMCSA announced that there was need to establish truck driver training standards since few requirements were in existence. They established the Entry-Level Driver Training Advisory Committee (ELDTAC) to conduct a negotiated rulemaking on entry-level training for drivers of commercial motor vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>

         </a>
         ”
         <br/>
         The ELDTAC committee is still working on a rule to
         <strong>
          <em>
           IMPROVE
          </em>
         </strong>
         training standards.   Ironically, CRST Van Expedited of Cedar Rapids, Iowa has requested an exemption from the FMCSA in regards to the very same existing training procedures which are in question by the FMCSA that are making our national highways less safe rather the improving safety. While it may seem obvious that the FMCSA would soundly reject such a request, the truth is that they have granted another carrier in the same class as CRST this type of exemption despite broad public opposition. The exemption request letter submitted by CRST Van Expedited of Cedar Rapids, Iowa to the FMCSA asks to grant permission so that CRST commercial learner permit CLP holders may operate a tractor-trailer while another CDL Holder is in the truck but not in the passenger seat. In the letter that CRST Van Expedited wrote to the FMCSA, they stated that the CLP holder will have completed a skills test which would entitle the student to return to their home state to receive their actual hard copy commercial driver’s license CDL but they claim that it is a financial hardship for them to do this, and that they are losing “
         <em>
          <strong>
           control
          </strong>
         </em>
         ” of the student. Therefore, CRST is requesting a safety exemption. CRST goes on to request that the FMCSA allow them to let the CLP holder be able to drive on the learner permit for the duration that it is valid, which can be several months.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Please understand something
         </strong>
         : CRST Van Expedited operates a “team driving” business model. This means that they have established customers who want their freight moved 24/7 without stopping for sleep breaks. That means that the entire operation is based on freight moving fast. Student truckers work from day one at CRST to make a profit for CRST. These students often choose CRST because they cannot afford to pay for truck driving school on their own and they want to learn to drive a truck. They agree to repay their tuition in exchange to learn on the job. The debt they incur to CRST is about $6500.00 which is comprised of food, lodging and instruction to become a qualified truck driver.
        </p>
        <p>
         The internet is littered with complaints about CRST Van Expedited training practices, they are easy to find, just Google “

        <p>
         This morning I spoke to a female trucker who is still in her 1
         <sup>
          st
         </sup>
         year of trucking. She has finally been able to get out of the clutches of CRST Van Expedited. I told her about the exemption request and she said none of it made sense to her because she came to them with her hard copy CDL in hand which meant she had only driven around the block a few times at her CDL School in Florida. She said the testers at the state facility included a former CRST employee who was really easy to pass students. She said there were people being sent on public transportation (Greyhound) back and forth before they were even hired for things like not having a background clearance by the company before arriving at their facility, so why is CRST claiming a “
         <em>
          <strong>
           financial hardship
          </strong>
         </em>
         ” to send their graduate CLP student’s home on public transportation in the exemption letter to the FMCSA?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Here are a few other things I learned from this student:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no pay during CDL training while they are a CLP holder. The student is charged for lodging and food in addition to the tuition.  The students are told the tuition repayment will be $40 a check but in reality it is $80.00 a week since they are paid twice a week. The first few weeks the students have no check at all so they are pretty broke and their personal bills are going unpaid. In her case it was about 5 weeks before she got her first check.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          So how much is the pay?
         </strong>
         She said it was about .24 CPM range but that amount was split so she got about .12 cents per mile.
         <em>
          If you are not a trucker you may not understand the way many truck drivers are paid which is only when the wheels are turning and mostly not every single mile at that!
         </em>
         <strong>
          Here is an example:
         </strong>
         her first week she did about 2400 miles with her trainer so let’s do some simple math:  2400 miles x .13 CPM = $312.00 gross pay. Let’s say her taxes were about $18.15 and take out her $80.00 tuition payment:   $312.00 – $18.15 – $80.00 =
         <strong>
          $213.85 net pay
         </strong>
         after going 5 weeks of no pay and letting her bills get behind.
        </p>
        <p>
         She said that her and her trainer did a lot of sitting since her trainer was pretty unmotivated, an owner operator that got paid by the load. Still, she had been away from home all of this time so technically she was at work 24/7. If they had been running team miles she could log legally 70 hours and so could her trainer.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I asked her how much time her trainer sat in the passenger seat supervising her, she said none. She said that when she got on her trainer’s truck she drove from day one at night until after midnight unsupervised which was technically against company policy.
         <strong>
          Is this an isolated incident?
         </strong>
         Not according to the vast driver complaints available on the internet from past CRST students.
        </p>
        <p>
         This particular student ended up quitting CRST after a number of unsafe situations occurred. The problem though was that she wanted to keep driving someplace else and no one would hire her because she left CRST before her debt to them was repaid.
         <strong>
          Remember, they bill each student like her $6500.00 for their “training”, food and lodging.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         For months she tried to get hired at other carriers but when the prospective employers heard the letters “CRST” they said they could not hire her.
         <strong>
          She had been blacklisted.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         It took threatening litigation for some of the things that were done to her to get CRST to release her from her contract to them. She wants to drive and work, not sue the carrier, nor does she want to be blacklisted by the trucking industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I applied what I learned from her to the letter CRST wrote to the FMCSA for an exemption to safety I saw that CRST wants to control more students who quit on them before they have repaid their debt rather than address their poor training and they want the federal government to help them do that.
        </p>
        <p>
         The “Skills Test” that CRST claims makes the CLP holder qualified to drive on is only a test after just a few weeks of driving the truck at a fenced in yard and going around the block a few times. It is not open road 18 wheeler driving experience with passenger cars whipping and weaving around you and cutting you off.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course CRST is entitled to get their tuition investment back from the students they are sponsoring but if those students are not really getting the instruction they thought they were paying for and they are scared to death by the situations they are being placed in they probably do not feel they should have to pay for an education they did not get.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Let’s all understand that a written test is all that is required to issue a commercial learner permit CLP
         </strong>
         . The FMCSA itself confirms that a few weeks of instruction does not constitute qualified truck driving for the open highway.
        </p>
        <p>
         Student/Trainees overwhelmingly report that they are pushed to drive “team” right after passing a their “skills test” but some say that there was methodical coaching given to them during the test and that they really didn’t understand what they were doing to the extent that they could operate the truck alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         The exemption request letter from CRST to the FMCSA asks to legally sanction CLP holders who have passed such a “Skills Test” and who have no open road driving experience to operate the truck with another Commercial Driver’s License CDL holder that is not required to be in the passenger seat. The exemption request letter does not specify if the CDL holder would be a trainer. Since CRST is known to allow two students to do team-driving I think this is important to clarify.
        </p>
        <p>
         CRST claims in the letter to be seeking the exemption to safety due to financial hardship for transporting CLP holder’s home on a Greyhound bus to get their hard copy CDL.  They go on to claim that the exemption will be a
         <em>
          <strong>
           “…equivalent level of safety that is greater or equal to the level of safety provided under the current regulations…”
          </strong>
         </em>
         though they offer no data, studies, safety statistics or financial documentation to support such remarks.
        </p>
        <p>
         One part of the letter mentions a
         <em>
          <strong>
           “…severe shortage of qualified and well-trained drivers…”
          </strong>
         </em>
         , though the CRST business model is not reliant on qualified and well-trained drivers to move their freight. Instead, they rely on new entrants who are a low wage, exploitable workforce with very little truck driving skill that are indebted to them in exchange for an education to become qualified drivers. They are also not producing a significant number of well-trained qualified drivers from their program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another concern I see in the exemption request is that CRST asks the FMCSA to allow the CLP holders to drive in a team driving situation with another “CDL holder” for potentially as long as the CLP is valid which can be several months.
        </p>
        <p>
         This could create an obstacle for the student later if they decide to quit. These are students who have been away from home already for several weeks with no pay. They are entitled to some home time. The argument CRST presents in the exemption letter about delays at state DMV facilities for students to get appointments makes no sense to whether the “CDL Holder” should be in the passenger seat supervising or in the sleeper not supervising them. This has no impact on how fast someone can get an appointment at a State DMV.
        </p>
        <p>
         What this exemption can do is help CRST control student truckers who have a tuition debt to them. It can prevent students who are being trained in an unsafe manner from quitting and going to work someplace who will train them the right way to be a qualified driver. It can make them more un-hirable elsewhere since they really do not have their CDL yet. It encourages student truckers to be unsafe because they have no other choice and it increases CRST Van Expedited profits.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is supposed to be overhauling the entry-level driver training system to improve safety standards, therefore they must not grant such exemptions that degrade and compromise safety for certain carriers like CR England who they have already granted this exemption despite broad opposition and CRST Van Expedited who both operate a “Team Driving” business model using student trucker labor.
