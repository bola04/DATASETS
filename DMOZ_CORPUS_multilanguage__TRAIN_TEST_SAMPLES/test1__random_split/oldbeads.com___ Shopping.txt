     My pages of ethnic and ethnographic beads and jewelry are an expression
 of my passions... 
 I  am a former bead store proprietor (8 years spent behind the counter
 of my retail store) who has, over time, become enchanted with the ancient,
 the tribal, the symbolic, the cryptic and the eclectic.  I have become
 a passionate investigator of the hand made, whether from thousands of years
 in the past, or from artisans of today....  and I have grown to be
 amazed at the wonderful objects it is possible to acquire.

     One of the rewards of owning ancient Roman beads, an Egyptian amulet, 19th
 Century African trade beads, a Yemeni silver bracelet, a Precolumbian stone
 pendant from the Americas or ancient stone beads from Irian Jaya is the
 knowledge that the same thing that you hold in your hand was worn and held
 important by a chain of owners extending back to its original manufacture. 
 The respect and admiration for the art and history of the piece exists
 within the new owner.

     Eye beads were used to ward off evil spirits, amulets protected the wearer
 from harm, charms and mementos and talismans had a very special, very important
 personal and mystic function for the owner that becomes infused into each
 piece and transformed by the modern owner into something personal of their
 own.

     Instead of languishing in insulated museum cases, it is wonderful to see
 these things loved, cherished, touched and brought back to life again.
