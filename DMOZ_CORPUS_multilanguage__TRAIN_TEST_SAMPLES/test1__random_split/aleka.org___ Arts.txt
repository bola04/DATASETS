          If you're asking yourself "Would River want people to see Dark Blood?", the late Karen Black answered this in the
          <a href="filmengrenzen.html">
           Filmen Over Grenzen
          </a>
          documentary :
          <i>
           "River was an actor. Every actor wants his work to be seen"
          </i>
          . After seeing the movie thanks to Anouk and George Sluizer, I concur. A lot of work went into it, it's only fair to give it a chance to be seen by everyone who wants, the way it was meant.

          to commemorate the 20th anniversary of River's death, the River Phoenix Pages have been re-designed a bit. New content has been added : a new biography has been released a few days ago (see

          George Sluizer talked last year about wanting to complete Dark Blood. He's now planning to show it
          <a href="http://www.filmfestival.nl/nl/festival/nieuws/george-sluizer-zoekt-steun-publiek-om-dark-blood-te-voltooien/ ">
           at the Dutch Film Festival in September 2012
          </a>
          , in Utrecht (Netherlands). Since he couldn't find enough sponsors to complete the movie, he turned to a crowd-funding website, dedicated to movie projects in Netherlands, Cinecrowd. He needs 15 000 Eur to finance the music and editing of the movie, and we're already above 10 000 Eur, so 2/3 are done already. The principle is simple :
          <br/>
          1) you send money and get a receipt (they have a Paypal account for international )
          <br/>
          2) if the global amount is met, depending on how much you gave, you will get rewards (here for example, for a contribution of 50 Eur, you get a limited edition DVD in addition to a few treats, so this may be your only chance to see that movie. For 300 Eur, you get 2 tickets to see the movie at the Dutch Film Festival)
          <br/>
          3) if the global amount is not met, you get refunded.
          <br/>
          So there's zero risk and you choose how much you want to contribute.
