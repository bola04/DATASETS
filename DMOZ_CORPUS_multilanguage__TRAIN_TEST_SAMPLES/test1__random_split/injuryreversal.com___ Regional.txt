        Specialist in trauma/accident and sports injuries
       </h1>
       <p>
        Have you ever been told to "just live with it"?  In most cases, this is simply not true. You do not have to live with old accident or sports injuries.  They
     can be reversed in whole or at the very least in part. There is no time limit from
     injury to treatment. Injuries in 80 year olds that occurred in high school
     have been successfully reversed with a dramatic impact on quality of life. In my office, injuries
     and sports medicine are approached from a holistic viewpoint.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Do you suffer from chronic pain?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Chronic neck pain, lower back pain, back pain in general, knee injuries,
     chronic leg/arm pain, even post traumatic dental malocclusion may be
     the result of old injuries. Injuries that are potentially reversible in order
     to restore you to a healthy state.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have successfully treated sports injuries without surgery on numerous
     patients in my Tacoma, Washington office. Even post operative patients
     have been successfully rehabilitated on an average of one half the usual
     time.
       </p>
       <p>
        My specialty allows me to significantly reduce pain and increase function to allow you
     to pursue the activities you used to be able to do. In my office, the technology exists to allow people like you to return to
     the activities and sports that you enjoy.
       </p>

        What is a Doctor of Osteopathy?
       </h2>
       <p>
        Osteopathic medicine is a complete, holistic type of medical care that focuses on the restoration of health.  Osteopathy places its focus on the interelationship between structure and function to take advantage of the body's phenomenal ability to heal itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Osteopathic medicine is not new.  It has been in existence for approximately 125 years in the United States and is now spreading like wild fire through Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  As Osteopaths, we are patient focused, utilizing whatever modalities are necessary to restore health.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Treatment Methods
       </h2>
       <p>
        I use a combination of osteopathic manipulative medicine, homeopathy, nutrition and allergy treatment
     (NAET).
