         Australians live an enviable lifestyle  in terms of their relationship with the outdoor environment and use of external  spaces. This is no more apparent than in Queensland where climate  dictates much of the way in which we live our lives. At Design Centre (NQ) our  goal is to create striking individual designs that respond to their site and  facilitate the occupants desired lifestyle.

         Queenslanders have an enviable climate, allowing people to spend much of their  time outdoors.  At Design Centre (NQ) we  focus on building a better lifestyle by designing homes that suit our tropical  climate. We put a larger emphasis on  energy efficient indoor/outdoor living areas and  connecting them to the landscape and pools with shaded verandahs. Encouraging  the prevailing breezes to flow throughout the house with well positioned windows  and doors also brings the outside in, or as we like to put it, bring the inside  out!
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         There are a number of key focal points  the team at Design Centre nq pay particular attention to when designing a new  home or extending an existing. Our clients brief along with the specific site features,  local climate issues, impacting energy efficiency and environmental  performance, budget requirements, and building style are all given equal  weighting to create something unique and special on every occasion.
