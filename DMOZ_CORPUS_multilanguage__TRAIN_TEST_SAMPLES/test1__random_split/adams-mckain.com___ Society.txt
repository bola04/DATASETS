     NOTICE:

    American Online (AOL) has, without notice, shutdown their genealogy websites (Kathy Linderholm's website with the Adams and related families is now shutdown).  All links to her website are not working--I am working on changing the links and  am in the process of replacing that information on this website. Our goal is to get the pictures, documents and history placed on this website. Thank you for your patience. Her AOL pages can be found at this
