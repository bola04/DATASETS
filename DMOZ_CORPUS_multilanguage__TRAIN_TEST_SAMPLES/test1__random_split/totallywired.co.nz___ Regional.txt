We moved from the historic Terrace Houses in the centre of the city to our semi-rural base - our third venue.

          . As longtime NuForce enthusiasts it was only natural for us to contact Jason Lim and ask if we could represent his new enterprise in New Zealand - previously we'd had to operate via a distributor company which was both inefficient and costly. Now the NuPrime range comes to us directly and we've been tasked to do the best possible job for you in New Zealand.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 2017 NuPrime now have a comprehensive range of models that cover both music, surround sound and multichannel. And there is more to come. You'll see that NuPrime, while being primarily active in Digital do have some excellent new analogue components. Every model from entry level upwards offers you a happy mix of both exceptional value and performance.

           "From the first few notes, we just looked at each other, with a look of surprise on our faces. Detail, speed, ambience and a total sense of space, around each individual instrument and voice. Notes that used to just end abruptly, now have an ambient trail of decay, as if you can sense the size of the room the instrument was recorded in. There's detail we just couldn't hear previously. I could go on with superlatives, but to say the KLEI cables are quite remarkable, is nothing short of fact."
