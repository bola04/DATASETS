           When I first started selling books on eBay eons ago, almost nobody posted photos with their descriptions, and those that did most often took photos with conventional cameras, 
 had the film developed by a third party and scanned the resulting prints into their computers. It was a multi-step process - both time consuming and expensive. I didn't bother. 
 Then digital cameras arrived ...

           There are numerous things that betray the amateur - or inexperienced - bookseller as an amateur. Often the description alone gives 
 it away via exposing a lack of command of bookselling terminology. Or not using something resembling the Standard Format. But perhaps just 
 as often it's what's not in the description.

           No question there are significant advantages to specialty bookselling. For one thing, it presents you with the opportunity - maybe I should call it a requirement - to truly 
 know your subject, and when you do know it, you can consistently get the best prices for your stuff. It also enables you to focus your efforts on inventory acquisition. We live 
 in a time when ...

           Confession: I have never in my life been on a surf board, but surfing has always intrigued me, and somewhere along the way it's become one of my cluster of bookselling 
 specialties. Perhaps being born in California has had something to do with it, but I know there's more to it than that. In his introduction to

           As my family and friends know, this has been, health-wise, a difficult year for me, and in a sense it began in November, 2016 when I contracted a strep infection followed closely on its heels by a 
 bout with bronchitis that would persist for many months. This triggered, in turn, three ER visits, four EKG's and numerous additional tests along with visits to various specialists in an attempt 
 to diagnose why I was having, among other things, serious low blood pressure episodes. A latest event - this has been especially fun - has involved an elevated PSA. I'm sure that the last thing most of you want to hear is a tale about somebody's health issues, but I'm telling you mine because I feel as though I've let some of you down, maybe more than some, 
 by being slow issuing both free newsletters and paid reports. If there's good news, it's that I think that all of this health junk has been solved, and I feel better than I have in months. I'm also 
 feeling enthusiastic about BookThink - and very much want to get on with things here.

           Years ago, the eBay bookseller's forum, aka the BSB, was a fount of useful bookselling knowledge. One of its more prominent contributors often posted what I guess you could call 
 bookselling aphorisms - concisely worded, generally applicable truths about bookselling. One such aphorism, re-posted recently by a surviving BSB member on the "new and improved" (NOT) 
 eBay forum, was the following: "Most new bookdealers burn out within three years ... " I've seen more than a few of them burn out myself over the last, now almost twenty years, but still, 
 some don't. Coincidentally, for those who don't it seems to take a similar period of three or four years for them to actually get it, as in, "Ohhh, now I see what I need to do to make 
 this bookselling thing work."

           When purchasing inventory, no matter what venue it happens in, there is always risk. The best we can do, it seems, is to make educated guesses on what will sell for a profit and hope to be 
 right most of the time. Having access to historical pricing obviously lessens the risk, but collector interest - for that matter, institutional interest - can change at any time, and even what 
 happened yesterday is no guarantee of what will happen again. But there are times when, if you're like me, you take what in gambling parlance is called a flyer. A flyer goes beyond educated guessing 
 and is perhaps better characterized as wild guessing. I like to think that I'm better at this sort of thing now than I once was, if for no other reason than experience seems to enhance my instincts - 
 and taking a flyer on something is almost purely instinctive, if not totally so.

           One would think that the passing of an author who wrote a book that, to date, has 
 sold over 50 million copies would merit something more than a yawn, but no fireworks have gone off since Robert James Waller's 
 passing a few days ago. More in today's feature article.

           Author Robert James Waller passed away on Thursday, March 9. There wasn't much fanfare about it, certainly nothing on the order of a few others recently deceased. Prince, say. 
 Or Arnold Palmer. Typically, authors don't achieve celebrity status, and why should they? At best they lurk in the background while we read - and sometimes get lost in - something 
 they've written, their faces nowhere to be seen. And it doesn't seem to matter much if somebody like Waller penned one of the bestselling novels of all time -
           <i>
            The Bridges of 
 Madison County
           </i>
           . Over 50 million copies sold to date.

           As most of you know, popular movies and television shows often drive sales of associated material - books, for example, magazines, and so on. In the 
 case of the recently concluded History Channel reality show series,
           <i>
            The Curse of Oak Island
           </i>
           , this phenomenon has certainly been afoot. Today's feature 
 article gets into more detail about this.

           Perhaps no buried treasure story is more intriguing than the one long circulated about the Money Pit on Oak Island in Nova Scotia - a deep tunnel dug near the 
 shore of the island, presumably in the early 1700's. peculation has it that it was used to bury pirate booty, though other theories abound, including one that a cache 
 of Shakespeare's manuscripts are down there. Through an ingenious system of tunnels ...

           So. Another year. BookThink was founded in 2003, nearly 14 years ago, and much in bookselling has changed since then, not the least of which is there's no longer easy money to be made - 
 at least not that I know of. But there is money to be made - still - and it can largely be done without getting up from your chair. Opportunities for purchasing inventory online 
 abound now, and if you find this process at all daunting, let me suggest that you start on a venue that you might already be comfortable with ...

             How to Buy Books Online: A Case Study

           </a>
           <br/>
           Though I purchase a significant amount of inventory elsewhere now, I still spend time most days on eBay searching for things I can make a buck on. What makes eBay a good starting 
 point is that you don't have to risk a lot of money. Today's feature article offers a case study on how this can be done even if you've never seen the book you're buying nor 
 heard of its author.

           Something I've long observed feedback I've received at BookThink is that there are, more or less, two types of buyers for our reports. There are those who want what I would call hot 
 information - tips - that will help them make fast money. And there are those who realize that this approach to bookselling - scoring big and soon - is little more than a recipe 
 for disillusionment. The latter are more interested in the foundational knowledge required to build a successful business on. Though some of BookThink's reports do emphasize what to buy, I've always attempted to keep most of the focus on what's needed in a more fundamental sense. 
 If you're new to this game, it's important to know that you can succeed - and do it in more than a modest manner - but it's perhaps more important to know that nobody gets there overnight.

           Not so many years ago international sales comprised about 25% of my sales. Today it's down to about 15%, 
 but I hear reports from not a few booksellers that their international sales have all but gone away. Today's feature article examines reasons for this and suggests at least 
 a partial solution.

             Have Your International Sales Gone Away?: A Packaging Suggestion That Might Turn Things Around
            </b>
           </a>
           <br/>
           Recently, I participated in a discussion on a bookseller's forum in which somebody declared, "I ship EVERYTHING in a box," then later noted that his packaging cost alone was about a 
 buck a book. A buck a book? This is far from the first time I've heard this sort of thing. The use of boxes by booksellers seems to persist, stubbornly, as though there was something 
 sacred in it. Or that, once one graduates to using boxes exclusively, one has arrived as a bookseller. What a bunch of applesauce.

           Just back from vacation, this year to Russia, the Baltics and several Scandinavian countries - and no, not once did I darken the doors of a bookstore. I understand that bookselling 
 is pretty much a 24/7 undertaking for most of us, but I've discovered that it's a good idea (for me) to drop everything remotely related to bookselling for a few weeks once a year and 
 let the world catch up to me. And clear.

           Do you depend on estate sales for part or much of your inventory? If so, how is it going? Do you enjoy getting up in the middle of the night to be first in line? Once inside, what then? 
 Is it fun, fun, fun battling other booksellers for books? Paying more and more for the books you are able to grab? Or maybe, too often, you come out 
 empty-handed, having burned an entire morning for nothing? Been there. I have felt the pain. But perhaps there is a better way to go about this? Some suggestions in

             A Cheap, Safe and Practical Method for Packing Books From Scratch
            </b>
           </a>
           <br/>
           I was never happy with commercial book boxes. They seldom fit right, aren't sturdy enough and still cost money. Envelopes and bubble mailers were not an option 
 unless I could fit boxes into them, so by minor trial and error I've developed a very simple, common sense, geometrically oblivious method for safely packing books that 
 works within my one man business. My customers have responded quite positively over the years so, even when I came close to purchasing commercial boxes during the most 
 prosperous times, I decided to stick with what works. Plus, the method is inherently friendly to recycling.

             BookThink's Proverbs of Bookselling Revisited: The Sixth Five
            </b>
           </a>
           <br/>
           As it is with so many professions, in bookselling there are things that must be done pretty much every day - or at least often. Books to pack and get out the door, sales to attend, 
 emails and phone calls to address and so on. And then there are things that can be put off until there's time to do them, listing books being one of the more crucial activities. But 
 when have you ever arrived at the end of a work day and said to yourself, "My work is done." It isn't done; it can't be. There is always something that is left undone.

           Sell many cookbooks? If you don't, it's likely you're leaving money on the table again and again. Next to Bibles, I consistently come across more cookbooks worth bothering with at sales 
 than anything else. If cookbooks are something you're serious about - or intend to be - there are some bibliographies that can prove useful. Today's feature article takes a close at them.

           When I got into bookselling, I knew next to nothing about cookbooks, nor was I overly interested in learning about them. But it wasn't long after I began to do market research that my 
 interest perked up considerably. I discovered that there were a handful of cookbooks I encountered at sales time and time again that sold for real money online - $50, $100 (and more) real. 
 In the ensuing years I've continued to learn more about them, and this has genre evolved into one of my specialties. In very recent years I've begun to focus on mixology as well.

           Some things in bookselling change; some things, seemingly, never do. One of the changes often cited is that the internet has leveled the playing field among more 
 experienced and less experienced booksellers. Or has it? Today's feature article offers a case study to ponder.

             Food Chain Bookselling:
             <br/>
             Does It Still Apply?
            </b>
           </a>
           <br/>
           Take a look at most any book with more than a few copies listed on most any major bookselling venue and, more often than not, you'll see an array of prices - sometimes a dizzying array. 
 There are a number of factors that can explain this, at least potentially. Condition might come to mind first, and it can be a huge factor in some instances, as can the presence or absence 
 of a dust jacket - or other factors that play into the issue of completeness. And one's business model may affect things, say, in the case of a mega-dealer who needs to move stock 
 quickly to keep a business viable, and thus price to sell. And - e-books and POD's are there in spades to complicate things.

             Low Cost, Sturdy Shelving for Booksellers
            </b>
           </a>
           <br/>
           Over three decades ago I walked into a used bookstore in the historic district of a Midwestern town and beheld an extraordinary array of bookcases that shelved what had 
 to be over 100,000 books. I wasn't there to buy books; I'd been called to the scene by the proprietor, who needed even more bookcases. A friend of hers had built the original 
 units but was no longer available, she explained, and, after leading me up to one of them, then asked, "Can you build me something to match this?" "I can," I said, "but I won't."

           Fraud in bookselling is an age-old issue, and even in our time - a time when it's so much easier to out somebody who isn't 
 doing the right thing - it persists. In today's feature article I present a case study of an eBay seller who has been getting away with murder for years. 
 I would appreciate your feedback.

           I'm not much of a policeman. I spend a lot of time buying books on eBay, so it's inevitable that I run across misrepresented books - a lot of misrepresented books. 
 To be charitable, I assume that most of them aren't deliberate misrepresentations, and mostly I just move on when I see them. Even if I felt so inclined, there wouldn't be 
 time to address every last one of them, and if I tried, I'm not sure it would foster much goodwill or even change most seller's practices. I sometimes make an exception 
 when a book is represented, for example, as a First Edition, is anything but, and it's getting bid up and up - and it's clear that the buyer will be hugely over-paying 
 for something that isn't what the seller says it is. Mostly I get polite replies from sellers. Sometimes no reply. Much less often do I get push back. I guess this 
 is some indication that most sellers want to do the right thing. But certain things nag at me some.

           2016 has arrived, and with it a fresh start. The primary focus at BookThink will be, as always, on buying and selling books, and several projects now in the planning stages will help the cause. 
 Look for announcements soon.

           Some of you may recall that, in a former lifetime, I designed and built furniture. For one reason or another, I probably built more shelving - or bookcases - than anything else. After you've 
 built your first 100 or so bookcases, you get a feel for what works and what doesn't; after 1,000, you don't even have to think about it anymore. You just know, usually at a glance, even 
 if you're looking at something you didn't build yourself.

           2016 is almost upon us, and how are things looking for you? Are holiday sales brisk? As BookThink 
 moves into its 13th year I can safely report that bookselling is a different game than it was in 2003, but 
 it's a game that can still be won. A few observations in today's feature article.

           Several months ago I purchased a turntable for my son's birthday. You can connect it to most anything - computer speakers, TV, whatever. Toss a record on it, and you're ready to go. 
 No expensive components to purchase, and at about $100, not a budget buster. The thing is, though he grew up in a different time, he likes how vinyl sounds, and so do I. So do many of 
 us. But I never anticipated I'd be buying a turntable for any purpose in 2015.

           Feedback for the November 22 BookThinker - "Critical Mass Bookselling" - was, let's say, above average, and it pointed to some things 
 I probably should have clarified the first time through. Thus a second look in today's feature article.

           <br/>
           As these things go, response to the November 22 BookThinker was fairly brisk. When I was writing it - specifically, the article on "critical mass" bookselling - 
 a small voice said, "Maybe you shouldn't use yearbooks as an example without elaborating on it." Based on some of the feedback I received, it appears as though that 
 voice was right.

           There are many viable approaches to bookselling, and any one bookseller may not settle on one but take on two or more. I know I do. But one approach that doesn't seem to come 
 up for discussion much is what I call critical mass bookselling - the topic of today's feature article.

           <br/>
           Other than buying low and selling high, what, if any, is your strategy for purchasing inventory? One possible approach - and a successful one for at least some booksellers - is to 
 purchase books (as cheaply as possible) with the best Amazon sales rankings. Not so many years ago I knew several booksellers who did this, maintaining inventories of about a thousand books, 
 and they did quite well, achieving turn rates of one quarter to one third
           <i>
            monthly
           </i>
           . When is the last time you sold one third of your inventory in one month? To be sure, this is 
 short-tail selling on steroids. But wouldn't it be nice to keep your inventory at this level and still make good money? What a time saver it would be! Or would it?

           In the process of searching a digitized text, how many times have you received a "no results" reply, even in situations where you know darn well the information you're 
 looking for is in it somewhere? I have, more times than I can count, and it often occurs in situations where there is no alternative source for the information - or at least 
 one that's remotely convenient. If you haven't already noticed, a significant percentage of digitized texts are comprised of poor scans - and are either unusable or nearly so. If you're researching a potentially valuable 
 book in an online bibliography, for example, this can be frustrating because you want very much to maximize its outcome. Fortunately, there is hope, and today's feature 
 article explains why.

           Say what you will about the effect the so-called Digital Revolution has had on the print book marketplace, I for one have found myself accessing digitized books and other 
 publications often of late - for research, mainly - and am thankful that I can. Though far from complete, at least some of the reference materials that booksellers once had to 
 darken doors of libraries to access (or spend big money to acquire) are now freely available in various digitized formats at the Hathi Trust Digital Library, the Internet Archive, 
 etc., not to mention numerous institutions. Better yet, unlike print content, these publications are readily
           <i>
            searchable

 book is not in collector's condition. A reading copy will probably look worse than a second-hand copy but better than a working copy." In turn, he defines a working copy as "the humblest 
 term in the vocabulary of condition." There's not much to add to this other than to note that ...

           It's funny how often learning a trade involves unlearning. One of the first things I "learned" as a bookseller was that Grosset &amp; Dunlap was a reprint house, and I labored under this 
 half-truth for perhaps a year or so before I unlearned it. Of course, Grosset &amp; Dunlap has issued countless reprints over the years, but, as booksellers, if we don't familiarize ourselves 
 with the many First Editions they published as well, we're likely to miss some important opportunities.

           When I first started selling books, I sold on eBay only. Then Amazon. Then other venues. As I added venues, I enjoyed a bump in sales every time, 
 and later, I began to sell books off-site, by other means (see #18), and experienced more bumps. But multiplying footprints isn't the entire story. If 
 you look back over the past twenty or so years, it's clear that ...

           When is the last time you heard another bookseller complain about not having enough books to list? When is the last time you complained about it? Never? If anything, 
 the story is more likely to be, "I have all of these darn books I haven't listed yet, and I keep buying more." And, so often, the spouse is complaining that books are taking 
 over the house. If this sounds familiar to you, and especially if you're experiencing a downturn, it might be a good time to look at some reasons for not listing a book 
 at all. There are many, and it can pay to heed them. Today's feature article discusses five of the most common.

           I have a question to pose: If you knew that the last book you listed will never sell in your lifetime, how would you feel? I concede that the process of listing some books 
 can be an educational experience in itself, and if this is the case, okay, time well spent. But how often is it? A more specific question: If you knew that only five or ten 
 of the last hundred books you listed would sell in your lifetime, how would you feel? I don't know about you, but I'd be thinking long and hard about the criteria I was 
 using for listing books, not to mention buying them. Time is too precious not to.

           For me, sales are usually somewhat quieter over the summer, and so it naturally becomes a time to do things that have been put off some. Like re-pricing. 
 I'm not a bookseller who re-prices much. Once a year at most, and even then it goes pretty quickly because not too much needs to be adjusted. Almost from the 
 beginning I've attempted to acquire inventory that doesn't need to be re-priced, though sometimes doing this is easier said than done. Often this means 
 listing books that are uncommon, much sought after or are special in some other way - signed books, for example. If you're re-pricing a lot, 
 have you considered why?

           So, how has bookselling been going for you lately? For many years I've made a point of reading and sometimes posting on bookselling forums to help me stay in touch 
 with what's happening in the trade. Also, via BookThink, I hear from many of you. It seems that things are somewhat more difficult for some of you now, but still - still - 
 there are those of you who are doing just fine. There are reasons for this. This is why BookThink is still here.

 in the morning so as to be first or near first in line. If it's a garage sale that's starting at eight and, to boot, states "no early birds" - well, you 
 don't have to play this game long to see that ...

           Spine roll, or spine cocking, is seen more often in softcover books than hardcover - and perhaps most often in comic books. For collectors it's a moderately serious fault. 
 To give you a feel for how serious, a rolled spine automatically reduces the comic book standard CGC grade, assuming no other issues, from 10.0 (Mint) to 4.0 (Very Good).

             BookThink's Proverbs of Bookselling Revisited
            </b>
           </a>
           <br/>
           Have you ever noticed how some booksellers seem to succeed almost effortlessly and others have to grind it out - and usually come up short? As much as I emphasize the need to acquire knowledge here - 
 and this is crucial - it's important, I think, to acknowledge that there's more to it than this. There's wisdom as well. Wisdom isn't what you know; it's what you are.

           The word "hack," which has numerous, often pejorative meanings, has taken on a somewhat more hip meaning recently: a quick, often clever solution to a 
 problem, as in, say, a hard-boiled egg hack, which might show one how to peel one without stripping half of the darn thing away with the shell. There are certainly 
 no shortage YouTube tutorials that demonstrate solutions for just this, perhaps my favorite being the so-called Ninja method. Well, booksellers have problems like 
 anybody else, so I thought it might be useful, occasionally, to offer some bookselling hacks in the BookThinker. Today's hack demonstrates a somewhat quirky 
 but effective approach to repairing a softcover book whose cover is, let's say, mangled.

           One of the first big buys I made years ago was a library belonging to a Professor of Spanish literature. No surprise, there were many Spanish language books, 
 and many of these were decades-old trade softcovers published in Spain and various Latin American countries in Central and South America. Most of the text blocks 
 were sewn, so they were pretty sound overall, but many of the covers were in various stages of disrepair.

           We've been publishing the BookThinker now for some 11 years. In cyber-time, this seems like an eternity. So much has changed since 2003. 
 But not everything has, and in antiquarian bookselling, given that it's a centuries old trade that's more about selling older things than newer, 
 it's no surprise that most of the changes we've seen in recent years have been associated with
           <i>
            what
           </i>
           we sell, not
           <i>
            how
           </i>
           we sell it.

           Like hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other booksellers, I work out of my home, toiling in relative obscurity. While it's nice to work from home - 
 I can work around my kids' schedules and other family demands - it can sometimes feel as if I'm working in a vacuum. I don't get to meet my customers and find 
 out more about their book interests. I don't often get the opportunity to develop relationships with other booksellers, something that is crucial for success 
 in the antiquarian book trade.

           <br/>
           On Saturday, November 8th, I participated in the 12th annual Houston Book Fair. It was my first fair. Set up was Friday. At CABS they told us that no matter how many book 
 fairs we do, we will always be anxious about at least two things: (1) low or no sales;(2) fellow dealers will think my stock stinks. To assist in ameliorating those fears the 
 faculty gave us a detailed list of what we would need to set up and strongly encouraged us to prepare a mock set up at home for our very first show. I over prepared and 
 am glad I did.

           At BookThink I've tried as much as possible to focus on "the how" of bookselling and not so 
 much "the what," though the what has certainly been addressed here over the years - sometimes, I admit, at the expense of the how. 
 Perhaps this is because so often booksellers new to the business ...

           It's been some time since I've previewed a new chapter in BookThink's Guide to Online Bookselling, but it seemed appropriate to do it today because this particular c
 hapter - Chapter 15 - could potentially make a big difference to booksellers who are having difficulty finding quality inventory at a good price. Believe it or not, books 
 that can be bought low and sold significantly higher on eBay are there for the taking every day -

           Anybody who knows anything about eBay knows that, if you can count on anything, you can count on change. Nothing ever stays the same, not even the logo. This was not a 
 venture that started with what you could call ... vision. Pierre Omidyar simply gave a bright idea a shot in the 1990's; it caught on almost immediately - fortuitously, I'd 
 say - it grew explosively, becoming so big so fast that it seemed at times hopelessly out of control. Those of us who were on board early will recall ...

           It's near axiomatic that the best reference books - and this also applies more specifically to book-related reference books - are inevitably those in which the author is both present and

 less promise for entertainment, and yet ...

           Today I'm reprising something I did early last month with book club sets. This time it's cookbooks - and not just any cookbooks; very common and very profitable cookbooks. 
 One cookbook is showcased in this issue's feature article, and nine more will be available by emailing me at editor@bookthink.com and requesting an invoice. 
 Lots of money to be made here....

 Military, sports, etc. I say "somewhat" reluctantly because, when I saw, early on, those

           As it is with authors, we booksellers have to start somewhere, and overnight success rarely happens. Years of apprenticeship is the more likely path, as is 
 selling lower-dollar material at the outset. However, even if you aren't ready to buy and sell the bigger stuff yet, there are some maybe-not-so-obvious things 
 you can do on the edges of the higher-dollar marketplace than can accelerate your progress. This is the topic of today's feature article....

           Everybody has to start somewhere, and typically, with the inevitable exceptions, those few who become famous for what they do don't do so overnight. Years of 
 obscurity often precede their making it big. As booksellers, we can cash in on this phenomenon -
           <i>
            if
           </i>
           we know what to look for and

           For many of us, book club editions, with few exceptions, don't figure into things. Sure, we might grab the occasional BCE of

 or more. These aren't blockbuster outcomes but ...

 difficult yet for otherwise would-be eBayer's who list many hundreds if not thousands of books on other, more user-friendly venues, none of 
 which require any photos. Yet. But it isn't just the photos that make selling on eBay daunting. Listing books without photos is itself a major time 
 hog. And it's a shame because, if you could ...

           Long time, no see. I've discovered that one of the difficulties of going solo now - producing content, coding, distributing 
 email newsletters, etc. - is that it doesn't leave much room to get these things done if something else comes up. And two things 
 came up in the latter half of this year - a month's-long project to add photos to every last book I had listed and an astonishingly 
 busy holiday season - bookselling, that is. I'd like to think they are related, and I'll elaborate on this in the following article.

           When I first started selling books in the late 1990's, I used eBay Auctions exclusively - and added no photos - and though many sellers listed items without photos in eBay's 
 early days, the introduction of affordable digital cameras and desktop scanners soon changed that. By 2000 or so sellers who didn't use photos were the exception, 
 and even I was busy snapping away ...

           A month or so ago I was at a sale liquidating the estate of a recently deceased, eightysomething widow. There were books in every room, thousands of them overall, and surprisingly, 
 most of them were relatively new. Topics were varied, but there was an especially strong emphasis on spiritual development with, happily, many occult titles present. There were also ...

           Here's an old saw: If you don't have your health, you don't have anything. And it's certainly as true for booksellers 
 as it is for anybody else. One of the more common stereotypes of booksellers is some old dude sitting behind a 
 counter with his legs up, reading, occasionally leaning forward to ring up a sale. But we all know that bookselling 
 is much more demanding than that ...

           You can learn a lot about people if you go to estate sales, especially if you're a bookseller, because books in particular, observed in a 
 group context, can reveal much about their owners. Also, in most cases, because estate sales typically function to liquidate estates of recently 
 deceased people, you can learn even more about ...

           So, let's say you've gotten in too deep on some Easton's, maybe paid $10 apiece for a box of ho-hum titles from the 100 Greatest Books Ever Written series, and closed eBay 
 auctions suggest that you will be working hard just to get your money back, even though yours are in fantastic condition. If this is the case, would you be interested 
 in a proven marketing method that will increase your outcomes to $25 to $40 for common Easton titles?

           Machine made paper produced in continuous rolls was introduced in the early 19th century and quickly replaced handmade paper as the publisher's preferred method of production. 
 At about the same time (though recent scholarship suggests it was somewhat earlier) so-called edition bindings came into being - specifically, mass-produced casings that were applied 
 to mass-produced text blocks. There are two important things to take away from this....

           First, buying and selling the Easton Press. If you're a bookseller, you've seen Easton's everywhere, and if you're like most booksellers, 
 you grab them enthusiastically because there is a ready market for them. It's an easy flip. And sometimes it's a big payday. But in recent 
 years values have come down considerably for many titles...

           <br/>
           Several silver processes have been devised and used over the years for photographic purposes, beginning in the late 19th century and extending well into 
 the 20th century. As prints made with silver-coated paper age, there is a tendency for the silver to become visible, often near the edges, and exhibit a metallic 
 sheen. The term for this is silvering, and, in an advanced stage, it can all but destroy a photo's value. And sometimes ...

           Identifying First Editions is an all-important skill for booksellers to develop, but we all know how maddening it can be at times - and sometimes how 
 impossible it seems when there are no published bibliographies of the author in question. Absent a bibliography, however, there are several other 
 approaches one can take to get the job done. Today's feature article explores one in detail that I've found to be very productive....

           Recently, I acquired a book by an author who was a household name in the early part of the 20th century but has long since been forgotten - James Oliver Curwood. 
 Curwood was not only prolific, penning some 26 books in 19 years; he was also popular. One novel in particular, The River's End, sold over 100,000 copies, and according 
 to Publishers' Weekly, it finished fourth overall on the 1920 bestseller list. Seven other Curwood titles also ...

           In early BookThink years I wrote often about selling on eBay because that's where just about everybody sold their books. This is hardly the case anymore. 
 As a result, I can't recall the last time I published a "Selling on eBay" article for BookThink. But, as I was looking over this year's sales figures, it occurred 
 to me that maybe I have been greatly remiss in not offering our readers a proven method for improving their sales ...

          Bookselling is less profitable today than it was a few years back. True or false? For the sake of argument, let's say it's true, and we wouldn't have to look far for reasons why. 
 The economy. Competition for inventory. Too many books for too few buyers. E-books. Postage increases. Fee increases. And so on. But even if these were valid reasons, 
 guess what? Tons of books are getting sold every day, still, and prices for some of them are moving north, not south.

           Today I'm going to offer something for discouraged booksellers (or booksellers who are doing fine but want to do better): 25 different things you can do in 2013 to grow your bookselling business. 
 Not all of these will apply to everybody because some of you are already doing them (or in some cases don't need to do them at all), but take a look and you might see something that 
 will make a difference....

 recently lost a literary treasure in Ray Bradbury. Science Fiction Editor Timothy Doyle interviewed Bradbury for BookThink 
 several years ago. Following is Tim's eulogy and the original interview.

           I've thought of Ray often over the years since I interviewed him for BookThink back in 2006. Coincidentally, I started reading 
 a book of his just a few days ago - Green Shadows, White Whale - so he has been especially on my mind recently. And whenever I've 
 thought of him, it was always with a warm feeling of pleasure that he was still with us, and still writing. Ray Bradbury lived 
 a fabulous life and will live on in his writing, but part of me can't help but feel empty and lonely knowing he is no longer with us ....

           Among dictionaries, there are but a select few that can actually be read with pleasure, as opposed to opening them only 
 when information about a word is needed. An example that many booksellers are familiar with is John Carter's classic,
           <i>
            ABC for Book Collectors
           </i>
           . It's not only clear, concise and conversational, but also Carter's presence is in evidence 
 throughout, often manifesting as dry wit. Years ago I ...

          One of the later chapters in BookThink's in-progress Guide to Online Bookselling will discuss simple

 All that's needed are a few clamps and blocks of wood. Today's feature article - an excerpt from this

          It seems to me, at times, that just about any bookselling question could legitimately be answered, "It depends." 
 It isn't just that there are so many exceptions to rules - though are there ever - it's also that it depends on
          <i>
           who
          </i>
          is asking the question. That person is best met where they are, I believe, not where they aspire to go to or where you 
 think they should be, so, theoretically, every answer would necessarily be different in some respect. And such 
 is the case even with questions that seem to get asked over and over again. Read more in today's feature article,

           Patterns emerge over time. The same questions, mostly from those who aren't booksellers, come up again and again. 
 When it happens on forums, sometimes these questions are patiently answered, sometimes they are dismissed with 
 a suggestion to search the forum archives (because the question has been answered so many times before) - and 
 sometimes the replies aren't so nice ....

 print-format book. There are many reasons, I believe, why print books will be collected for years 
 to come, but one fundamental reason became clear to me after reading a Heritage Press edition of W. Somerset Maugham's

           In recent years many arguments for and against the demise of print books have been advanced. Arguably, some 
 evidence for their demise is in: The growth of digitized books has exploded, after all, and many commodity booksellers 
 have experienced sharp downturns in sales. Still, the antiquarian book trade remains healthy. Some of us 
 believe that it will remain so indefinitely ....

           Dust jackets, in the two-panel / spine-panel / two-flap format they have evolved into, may seem simple enough 
 as objects go, but there are actually numerous design considerations that come into play, some of which apply directly 
 to what we as booksellers do. Take size. Well, it just needs to fit the book, right? Certainly in the top-to-bottom sense, 
 yes, though there have been instances when ...

          How to remove odors from books may not be the number one question booksellers ask, but surely it's in 
 the top ten. Ask it in a forum, and you'll get many different answers - baking soda, cat litter, Febreze, etc. - 
 and I've written here about the use of ozone generators. But sometimes Mother Nature can help the cause.

           Things usually arise when a need for them arises, and this is as true of dust jackets as anything else. 
 The need for dust jackets arose with the introduction of permanent but less durable cloth bindings in 
 1820, and their first appearance, so far as we know, occurred a few years later. Prior to this publishers 
 issued books primarily as ...

           <br/>
           I'm old enough to recall a time when it was common practice to toss out dust jackets - in fact, I 
 often practiced tossing them out myself. When I was teaching myself to write in the 1970's, I put together 
 a pretty substantial library of reference books, and the first thing I did when I acquired a new book 
 was to yank the dust jacket off ...

           If you sell books written in only one language, you will effectively eliminate the majority of this 
 planet's books from your pool of potential inventory.  Unless you can consistently acquire more quality 
 books in your native language than you know what to do with, therefore, it makes sense to at least 
 consider foreign language books when they become available for sale ...

          I'm sure all of you who have been in the bookselling biz for a year or more have compiled 
 a mental list of what I call bread-and-butter books - those books that you not only encounter 
 often but also sell quickly for worthwhile profits. Most of these books won't climb into three 
 figures but many sell in the $30 to $50 range and provide a consistent source of income over time ...

 make it easier for you and name the first two: Shakespeare (the Sonnets) and Lao-Tzu (

            Tao Te Ching

           ). Need 
 more clues? This poet's most widely read book was first published in 1923, selling just over a thousand copies. 
 Today, 89 years later, many thousands of copies sell weekly ...

 obsolesce quickly as new applications are inevitably developed, but if nothing else, this will at 
 least give you an idea of how close the tablet has come to replicating a desktop or laptop computer

          Technology marches on, and to some extent bookselling with it. I began my bookselling life carrying 
 a scouting book with me, and this almost seems quaint now, given the breathtaking capabilities of today's 
 smartphones. The march of technology has steadily headed toward faster and smaller. Faster is always 
 better, but is smaller?

           Not so long ago, in what now seems like the dark ages of online bookselling, most of us who were starting out as 
 booksellers were flying blind. Unless you had deep experience in the trade or had compiled a comprehensive scouting 
 book, there were no resources to help us to make buying decisions in the field. More often than not we were left 
 to our instincts, and mistakes were inevitably made ...

          There are many knowledgeable booksellers who are ready and willing to teach new or 
 less experienced booksellers a thing or two, sometimes many things - and most of us 
 take advantage of these opportunities. But we booksellers also learn much from collectors; 
 in fact, it's often collectors who are the most generous sharing what they know. 
 Moreover, collectors often author the best reference books ...

           Collectors often author the best reference books, perhaps because their passion for what they collect 
 inspires them to lavish as much attention on writing about their collections as they do on the collections themselves. 
 Such is certainly the case with Everyman's Library collector Terry Seymour ...

          I've said this before, but it bears repeating: Books that have remained in print over many 
 decades can teach us a great deal about bookselling. Typically, they exist in multiple 
 editions with a wide variety of bindings - and often with continuously revised and expanded 
 (not to mention translated) content ...

          The lowly book club edition ain't always so lowly. Here are some reasons why from Chapter 9 
 of BookThink's Guide to Online Bookselling: First, some BCE's are in fact the first appearance (sometimes 
 the only appearance) of a title in print - that is, the actual first edition, first printing, first you-name-it. 
 Though not common, coming across this exception can make your day. Example: The First Edition Society of the 
 Franklin Library has published dozens of limited first editions ...

           In BookThink's early years there was a running joke, primarily in our forums and entirely 
 at my expense, that I held and treasured a massive collection of microwave cookbooks. My own 
 fault, no doubt, because I often pointed out in articles that there was perhaps no class of 
 books that was more ubiquitous - or more consistently worthless. I suppose similar sport could 
 be had with another class of "worthless" books - book club editions ...

          The recent death of Apple founder Steve Jobs has had an impact that can be measured 
 in many ways, some obvious, some perhaps not so obvious. For booksellers, the death of 
 any so-called VIP has positive impact measured in dollars and cents. On eBay, publications 
 featuring Jobs, especially early in his career -
          <i>
           Macworld

          ,
          <i>

          <i>
           Wired
          </i>
          , etc. - 
 are enjoying strong sales, as we would expect. Not so obvious, perhaps, a publication 
 that at first glance seems to have no connection to Jobs whatsoever - Stewart Brand's
          <i>
           The Whole Earth Catalog
          </i>
          , published primarily in the late 1960's and early 1970's with 
 occasional reprises until the 1990's ...

 if you could trust anything about books, it was that the bad stuff would eventually fall 
 away and only the good stuff would survive - and be far more conspicuous by virtue of its 
 survival. That's how it worked, sure enough, and examples were not hard to come by: Melville was ...

 sitting on their porch watching the highlights of the water soften into night. No moon, no lights reflecting off the 
 water, only shadows from which the occasional rustle of night creatures were heard. There was a calm quietness, 
 like nature awaiting a storm, when suddenly, "What in the world was that?" An apparition ...

           Have you been hearing more calls lately? Recession calls, that is? The latest and 
 perhaps most unequivocal call for a double-dip recession arrived last week from the 
 Economic Cycle Research Institute. The ECRI has its critics, and some dispute its asserted 
 perfect track record for predicting recessions and avoiding false alarms, but it's 
 difficult to dispute Lakshman Achuthan's conviction ...

           Years ago, in the process of paying for books at a sale, an estate sale liquidator told me, 
 "You know, I can never figure out what books you're going to buy. You always surprise me." 
 To my mind, this was one of the highest compliments anybody ever paid me because it pointed 
 to one thing - specialized knowledge. It's fine and dandy to have and act upon your good instincts 
 when scouting for inventory ...

           In the last installment of this series, I talked about what to expect when you actually go on the house call. 
 I discussed my philosophy on coming up with an offer price, focusing on a collection where you have a good idea 
 of the resale value of the books. I also covered some of the factors that could influence your decision to buy or pass; 
 for instance, the ratio of good books to trash in the collection, and how much work would be involved 
 in dealing with the trash.

 Dachau and Buchenwald, which combined to produce nearly 100,000 deaths during WWII. That he was 
 Jewish made this all the more remarkable. As you might suspect, it's a painful chapter ...

           <br/>
           I recently received an email with the intriguing subject line "Wish to sell 400-500 SF books." The gentleman described 
 himself as a longtime collector and stated that most of the books were first editions and printed from 1960 through 1990. 
 The location of the books was approximately a two-hour round trip for me. While the email was quite brief and to the point, 
 there was a lot there to interest me.

 "The Stillness of Trout: How to Shop FOL sales." Funny thing, I haven't attended an 
 FOL sale since I wrote that article over seven years ago, but this month I was reminded of 
 it several times in several competitive situations. The first situation involved a widely 
 advertised estate sale featuring a library which was comprised in part of Easton Press books ...

 Godin coined the term "Permission Marketing" in his breakthrough text for e-commerce entrepreneurs. The book revolves around the idea that you should turn 
 customers into friends and then develop relationships with those friends which, will eventually generate repeat sales, assuming you are able to create a Purple Cow ...

            <b>
             MediaScouter

           , a popular book scouting service. To note - my Android phone is a Motorola Droid X. I bought it late last year, and it was a nice upgrade with a larger screen and faster processor than my previous Droid phone. For my own scouting I have been mainly using the Android Amazon application, along with a few other barcode scanner applications. The Amazon application is the fastest I've tried and generates the most helpful information for selling books. It pulls up the individual sellers and their descriptions (or lack there of) and gives me insight on whether or not I can take advantage of writing a better description (as pointed out by our esteemed editor in a recent issue of BookThink) compared to the other sellers, and therefore pull in a higher profit. I often sell books on average about $3 more and many times even higher with an exceptional description.

           of BookThink's Guide to Online Bookselling, I suggested that inexperienced booksellers study catalogs of mid- and upper-tier auction houses to accelerate the process of learning how to describe books. The better catalogs are accompanied by clear, color illustrations, and by referring back and forth between these illustrations and their textual descriptions, one can start to learn not only how to describe a book's condition but also its important physical elements - each with terminology that will suggest that you know something about books. And the latter is important because it establishes trust between you and potential buyers and, more importantly, allows you to ask for and achieve good prices. In turn, if you can achieve good prices, you can compete more favorably in the marketplace for inventory - pay better prices for it, that is. And so it goes until you wake up one day and realize that you've figured out how to make money at this!

           Chapter 6:
           <br/>
           Trust, The Sine Qua Non of Bookselling
           <br/>
           When I first started selling books, I took frequent road trips and looked for inventory in, among other places, used bookstores. Most bookstores weren't selling online then, and there were many opportunities for arbitrage. I recall visiting a Tampa, Florida bookstore one day - it was nineteenninetysomething - I found a few local history books, and I took them up to the counter to pay for them. I don't recall how we got on the topic, but I quietly mentioned something to the proprietor about having bought some books online. Well, this mild-mannered Dr. Jekyll suddenly transmogrified into a monstrous Mr. Hyde, and I stood amazed at the subsequent tirade that went on for minutes, not moments.

           Crime isn't pretty. If you need a light mystery romp or a hero with a magnetic personality, 
 this novel may not be for you. If you like crisp writing that moves along swiftly and prefer unvarnished reality when dealing with life's seamy side, you'll find it to be an enticing page-turner. The reader of
           <i>
            A Very Simple Crime

           is immediately swept into a world of dysfunctional personalities.

           Stephen King dominated the Fiction Top 10 with 3 entries among titles by Hemingway, Fitzgerald, McCarthy, Koontz, Rand and Howard. The nonfiction list was 
 populated by the mix of Warhol, the Bible, Jimmy Page, and Edward Lear with Picasso and George Harrison thrown in. Tolkien held 2 places on the Antiquarian and Collectible list. The other spots were held by titles dating from 1476 to 1790.

           In the previous article the Marquis 25 was selected - the top 25 collectible American picturebooks. Although some might argue whether a book or two belongs in this list, most would agree that all belong in the Top 100 Collectible American Picturebooks. The next logical step is selecting the books that almost made the Marquis 25 - what I call the "Nearly No Brainers." These have many of the qualities of the Marquis 25 but by comparison do not have all the necessary credentials.

 bookseller-designed database application was available to members only, but that will change beginning February 28, when it will be publicly offered as freeware.

           In December, the top 10 fiction category included authors ranging from Jane Austen to Neil Gaiman. In addition, regulars such as Fleming, O'Connor, Pynchon, 
 and Meyer made appearances. Coming in at #1 in the non-fiction group was Gen. Carl von Clausewitz 3-volume set
           <i>
            On War
           </i>
           , made particularly special because it 
 came from the library of T.E. Lawrence. A 1935 Japanese karate book came in second, followed by an unredacted copy of
           <i>
            Dark Heart
           </i>
           , the Taschen 
 publication
           <i>
            Kate Moss
           </i>
           , and 4 late-19th century volumes on chess, among others.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The Antiquarian and Collectible list was dominated by US sellers and contained both Best Offer and auction sales. Picasso, Wilfred Owen, Seigfried Sassoon, and Mark Twain 
 were included in the top 5.

           I didn't discover antiquarian bookselling or consider it a viable career option until I was well into my 30s. Had I known the world of antiquarian books even existed prior to then, I would have found a way to major in it in college.

           <br/>
           And so goes the exchange between super-agent James Bond and super-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld - a mid-century Holmes and Moriarty pairing that powered multiple 
 books and films in Ian Fleming's James Bond canon. It could be said that Fleming himself lived twice, once as a WWII British Naval Intelligence Officer, the architect 
 of both Operation Mincemeat and Operation Goldeneye, and once again, imaginatively, as James Bond himself, in 14 now-classic spy novels and story collections.

             DIKW and the Survival of Printed Books
             <br/>
             A Bibliophile's Considered Opinion
            </b>
           </a>
           <br/>
           I am a bibliophile: I love books. Most of you - I think I know BookThink's audience pretty well by now - also love books. We share this gladly. As bibliophiles, we are concerned about the survival of the printed book, not only because its departure, immediate or by attrition, will negatively impact our chosen profession of bookselling, but also because printed books enrich our lives broadly and profoundly in a manner that Google results can never.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           But it isn't always easy to articulate why. The Digital Revolution has inspired much conversation about this, but most of it has been and remains focused 
 on the interaction with books as physical objects - the feel of them in our hands, their aesthetic beauty as
           <i>
            objets d'arte
           </i>
           on a shelf, or perhaps the quiet, deeply receptive experience of reading text illuminated by reflected light, an experience that cannot possibly be replicated by the direct-lit assault from a blaring, pulsating computer monitor or e-reader (though Kindles have taken a first step to mitigate this).

            Yes, I'm late to the party. Fulfillment by Amazon has been available to sellers for several years now, and I just got on board late last year. The FBA concept is simple: 3P sellers bulk ship their books or other items to one of Amazon's warehouses, and when something sells, Amazon packs and ships it. Couldn't be easier. What this does is expose your inventory to market segments you previously had no (or indirect) access to - namely, customers who use Amazon Prime, Super Saver Shipping, not to mention Gift Wrapping. It also enhances your position in search, and most important of all, provides built-in trust. Customers who otherwise might be reluctant to purchase items from 3P sellers are not at all reluctant to pull the trigger under the Amazon umbrella. Fees are somewhat higher and apply to both sales and monthly storage, but in my limited experience these are more than offset by increasing my prices, which I can get away with because of the above competitive advantages. Also, I realize significant savings on shipping by taking advantage of UPS deeply-discounted rates to bulk ship to Amazon warehouses.

 potential to help supplement your online bookselling income.

            In this fast-moving novel Jilliane Hoffman paints a frighteningly real picture of the vast playground the internet provides for sexual predators and the vulnerable teens and children they target. Thirteen year old Lainey Emerson has gone missing, and FDLE Special Agent Bobby Dees is on the case. Head of the Department's Crimes Against Children Squad in Miami for more than a decade, Dees is haunted by the unsolved disappearance of his own daughter throughout the investigation, leading him alternately through a maze of hope and despair. It's a high-pitched suspense, skillfully written in a totally engrossing (but not gross) style of this difficult subject matter that will have you riveted to the pages of this book from start to finish.
