               We are a small agency with a long track record in web sites, development and CD/DVD interface design. But we've done just about everything.
              </p>
              <p>
               We work hard to understand the story and image you're trying to convey. And we're experts at making graphics, typography and color come together to deliver an impact considerably larger than you might think your budget will allow.
              </p>
              <p>
               We work with the latest technology and provide access to functionality that is normally beyond the budget of small businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
               We're small enough so when you hire us, you get us, not interns or juniors or account reps. But we're not too small. We work with a network of freelance designers, writers, photographers, and illustrators to bring even the most ambitious projects in on time and within budget.
              </p>
              <p>
               We also work hard to mesh with marketing and creative teams. One of our clients paid us a great compliment when he said, "You play well with others."
              </p>
              <p>
               We  understand small business challenges and we understand good web design and  development. We’d like you to call us.

               We  do website development. Now days most of the sites are developed in a CMS system that allows the client to directly access their site to make edits and add new content. We use commercial and open source CMS systems and then tailor them to meet your specific needs.
              </p>

               We  integrate social media marketing into your website. Facebook and Twitter are the latest web marketing tools. They can be a great advantage when used properly. We can integrate them into you web site and put you on the leading edge of web marketing.

               LineAngle maintains its own dedicated servers. They are in a secure data center in Dallas and provide 24/7 telephone technical support. But the best part is we host only our own clients, so you will not be sharing a server with three or four hundered other sites. No more having your site go off line because of some rouge website sharing your server.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our servers have huge dual hard drives that are backed up daily. We always have a copy of your site on the second hard drive. Our servers have 4GB of memory and are hooked up to one of the largest internet pipes in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
               All this means fast and reliable service. And, you call and talk directly to us. We handle all the technical stuff for you.

                Intermedia Exchange Hosting
               </strong>
               — While our hosting plans provide a very robust mail service offering both POP and IMAP accounts, we prefer a real hosted exchange solution. This allows the client to utilize clients on their phone, iPad, laptop, notebook and desktop that produce the same email account. Beyond that the service provides the best web interface in the industry for email.  True Outlook on the web. While this solution is not as cheap as just using a pop account on your domain server the advantages really pay off for a small business. A full Exchange solution with spam and virus filters, 3 or more email accounts, 25 GB of storage and someone elst to manage it for you. All that for $25 a month. We can assist you in setting up your domain to work with Intermedia.
