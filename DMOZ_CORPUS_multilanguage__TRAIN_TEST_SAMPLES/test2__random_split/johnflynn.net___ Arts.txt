                                                     "John Flynn isn't the only artist I admire that my kids discovered on their own. But there are similarities between him and the others. Two of the best writers I ever knew - Roger Miller and Shel Silverstein - had, in common with John, fertile imaginations, a Shakespearean love of words, and the ability to see funny things with a child's eyes. Their art, like John Prine's, is a wonderful combination of humor and heart that can move kids and grownups to laughter, tears, or both... The truth is in the details; the gifts are an ear for accurate dialogue, an eye for powerful imagery and anything funny, and a heart open to surprises and the possibilities of moving the emotions. John Flynn is one of a special breed of good-hearted artists whose reaction to the Human Condition finds kind, humorous expression. God bless them.‚Äù - Kris Kristofferson

                                                   My continued thanks to those who support New Beginnings-Next Step, Inc through donations at my shows and in the mail. As Executive Director my time and efforts have been increasingly monopolized by this work but in a very real way I feel it is exactly what I‚Äôve been doing all along with my music. I know that as a young parent when one of my kids was sick, though I loved all my children equally, my ear was always turned to the cry of that sick child. There were nights where Beth or I slept by that ailing child's door, or held it in our arms. I often feel that the Lord is like a young parent and I feel God most keenly in the presence of those who are asked to suffer greatly, as in the case of our incarcerated brothers and sisters.

Reviewers often write that Flynn 'follows in the footsteps of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger,' yet John's work for justice and fairness is something he weaves seamlessly into his concerts. He truly inspires his audience. His most recent concert here ranks among our favorites and we look forward to the next time."

Last night we finished cutting vocals on a song called Sing Me on my Way which features the voices of family, friends and heroes I've worked with throughout my career. Singing on the track are folks like Kris Kristofferson, Arlo Guthrie, Kathy Mattea, and Billy Swan, Jane Kelly Williams, Lizanne Knott, and Ben Wisch. Even my kids and my brother Mike (my first singing partner) join me at the microphone. I can't wait for you to hear it!

                                                    Someone in one of our men's prison groups recently complained about a new transgender inmate named Wheeler. (Not using real names here.) Although Wheeler identified as a woman, DOC classifies people solely on the basis of anatomy. Being new to prison, Wheeler was - quite understandably -having a difficult time adjusting. And she wasn't the only one.

                                                   One: Though part of Martinez's discomfort grew from simply not knowing what to say (and then covering his embarrassment), people can usually tell what's in your heart. Even a dog knows the difference between being accidentally stepped on and being kicked. So we should just do our best but not worry so much about slipping up and saying the wrong thing occasionally. We're all trying to figure this stuff out at some level. If there's no malice in your intent there will seldom be a real problem in using the wrong words. Especially if you bring to the moment an open heart. So if you don't know how a person prefers to be referred to or addressed, just ask them. (Regarding misgenedering, I've since been challenged on this point, but although I realize context isn't a magic wand, I remain comfortable with my position.)

                                                   A week later I found out that Martinez had, a few days later, invited Wheeler to join his afternoon card game. I simply can not express how profound a gesture this was.¬† Such a simple thing. And yet so very powerful. And what inherent risk it entailed for someone who has struggled with what others might think of him. I told Martinez how proud I was of him and asked if he‚Äôd received any blow-back. ‚ÄúHell yeah!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are always gonna be haters. Jokers call you 'faggot' and shit! I don‚Äôt care. I thought about what we talked about and decided that no one gets to tell me who I can and can't hang around with."

Although she didn't say much during her first meeting with us, afterwards, before going back to her pod, she said something to one of my volunteers that I will never forget. She said ‚ÄúThank you for making eye contact with me.‚Äù I don't think I had ever truly considered a world where this simple acknowledgment of your very EXISTENCE was something to take notice of and be grateful for.

                                                     Hi friends,
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     I realize that my notes deal more with my prison work than my music these days. Please don‚Äôt take that as a sign that I‚Äôm sticking my guitar case in the closet. Aside from releasing several digital singles in 2017 (These were topical songs which probably comes as a surprise to no one), I‚Äôve been writing and recording material for an album that I‚Äôm planning to bring out by late summer. One track- a new song which I‚Äôve taken to closing my shows with these days is called Sing Me on my Way and features an entire choir of old friends, including Kris Kristofferson, Arlo Guthrie and Billy Swan. (The list is still growing!) So don't count me out you guys. I've got some more songs in me. I'm gonna keep singing them and will be relying on you to help me spread the word.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     I‚Äôm excited to be heading to Kansas City next week to perform an official showcase at the International Folk Alliance. The list of showcase artists draws from all over the world and is actually quite impressive.

                                                     On the summer horizon, I was recently honored to be booked by the Guthrie Center in Great Barrington, MA to do a show on July 14, 2018 for Woody's birthday celebration! Of all the artists they had at their disposal, I was very touched to have bee selected for this special performance. And yes, you'll be hearing me sing some Woody that night!

On Sunday, February 11th, I‚Äôll be in Alexandria VA doing a show with the wonderful Anne Hills at the George Washington Masonic National Memorial¬≠

                                                     Although I haven‚Äôt been performing as much as I‚Äôd like these past few months, I‚Äôve been kept incredibly busy with my prison and returning citizen work. Yesterday we actually held our second weekly New Beginning‚Äôs group at Baylor Women‚Äôs Correctional Institution. This is the sixth group I've taken on (with the help of a great team of volunteers! It's also my first in a women's prison. We have about 20 women in the new group and their appreciation and level of participation has been very moving. (It literally took me years to reach this level of openness and courage with the men's group!) Although I went into this situation knowing that I‚Äôd be dealing with some new and different dynamics and issues, my sense that we‚Äôre not there to solve or fix each other, but simply stand with and listen deeply to one another seems to be being borne out. I‚Äôm grateful that I have a terrific group of female volunteers who accompany me into Baylor as the talk is- just as with the men‚Äôs prison- open and frank. (I think yesterday was the first time I ever blushed in a prison.)
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Sex remains such a huge stumbling block for us as a society. My friends Donald and Barbara Olsen, counselors from the Locus of Hope addiction treatment center, recently gave a wonderful workshop on sexual addiction to our Returning Citizen group. They helped us find language and begin to openly address the underlying reasons for which sex and sexuality can be misused and are often so deeply misunderstood. Seeing how our guys responded, both their reticence to speak and their hunger for the information being shared made me more aware of how we so often live as strangers to ourselves, let alone other people.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     It also reinforced for me the value of what we do in trying to provide a circle of trust and compassion where we can begin to risk opening up to other human beings.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Someone in one of our men's prison groups recently complained about a new transgender inmate named Wheeler. (Not using real names here.) Although Wheeler identified as a woman, DOC classifies people solely on the basis of anatomy. Being new to prison, Wheeler was- quite understandably-having a difficult time adjusting. And she wasn't the only one.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt looking for trouble, but that stuff really freaks me out.‚Äù Martinez said with almost practiced disdain. Plus, if you‚Äôre SEEN with people like that, then other people start wondering about YOU! All I know is he... she... IT... better steer clear of me.‚Äù
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Before I could say a word, another member of our circle came back at him hard. ‚ÄúKnock off the ‚Äòit‚Äô crap! Don‚Äôt use that kind of language here. You‚Äôre talking about another human being! What about what we talk about in New Beginnings? What about working on your own shit and not judging other people? None of us in here is perfect or has all the answers. If you think you do, maybe this isn‚Äôt the group for you.‚Äù
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     The room was momentarily filled with a charged tension but the disagreement that ensued was talked out and worked through-as is our way- with measured and respectful words. I saw each man, guided by his brothers in the circle, really attempt to listen to the other. And within minutes a truly amazing discussion evolved. By the time we began our closing meditation ninety minutes later, the group was in general agreement on several points.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     One- Though part of Martinez's discomfort grew from simply not knowing what to say (and then covering his embarrassment), people can usually tell what's in your heart. Even a dog knows the difference between being accidentally stepped on and kicked. So we should just do our best but not worry so much about slipping up and saying the wrong thing occasionally. We're all trying to figure this stuff out at some level. If there's no malice in your intent there will seldom be a real problem in using the wrong words. Especially if you express an openness to learning. So if you don't know how a person prefers to be referred to or addressed, just ask them.

                                                     Two- Prison is a place that, by its very nature, deprives an individual of a large measure of their dignity.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Three- Prison can be, for the toughest, but especially for newcomer, a very lonely and frightening place. (So how much more so for a new transgender individual!)
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     And finally- regardless of whether or not you‚Äôre comfortable with another inmate‚Äôs sexual preferences or identification- a subversive way to buttress and fight for your own (probably) damaged sense of self worth might be to do what you can to let each and every person you come into contact with (Correctional Officers included) know that you recognize them as being possessors of basic and inherent dignity as human beings. It may be something as simple as saying hello.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     I walked out that evening both marveling at the arc and honesty of the guys' discussion and wondering if anything would come of it.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     A week later I found out that a few days later Martinez had invited Wheeler to join his afternoon card game.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     I simply can not express how profound a gesture this was.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Such a simple thing. And yet so very powerful. And what inherent risk it entailed for someone who has struggled with what others might think of him.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     I told Martinez how proud I was of him and asked if he‚Äôd received any blowback. ‚ÄúHell yeah!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are always gonna be haters. Folks call you 'faggott' and shit! I don‚Äôt care. I thought about what we talked about and decided that no one gets to tell me who I can and can't hang around with... Besides‚Äù, he added, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a good dude!‚Äù
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     If you want to have your faith in the human heart restored, simply stand with the ones whose hearts have been broken. It works every time!
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Peace,

 																		Elliott* 
 																		(*not 
 																		real 
 																		name), a 
 																		long 
 																		time 
 																		member 
 																		of our 
 																		Gander 
 																		Hill 
 																		Prison 
 																		group, 
 																		is being 
 																		transferred 
 																		to 
 																		another 
 																		facility 
 																		this 
 																		week. In 
 																		his 
 																		final 
 																		session 
 																		with New 
 																		Beginnings 
 																		he 
 																		looked 
 																		across 
 																		the 
 																		circle 
 																		at a man 
 																		named 
 																		Claude* 
 																		who'd 
 																		only 
 																		been 
 																		attending 
 																		our 
 																		meetings 
 																		for a 
 																		few 
 																		months. 
 																		Claude 
 																		had come 
 																		to us 
 																		with 
 																		more 
 																		than the 
 																		normal 
 																		share of 
 																		inmate 
 																		challenges 
 																		(and I 
 																		remember 
 																		wondering 
 																		if we'd 
 																		be able 
 																		to help 
 																		him 
 																		much) 
 																		but week 
 																		by week, 
 																		we'd 
 																		seen him 
 																		grow in 
 																		confidence 
 																		and self 
 																		awareness. 
 																		He was 
 																		visibly 
 																		buoyed 
 																		by the 
 																		trust 
 																		and 
 																		affection 
 																		he 
 																		experienced 
 																		in 
 																		group, 
 																		and 
 																		instead 
 																		of 
 																		continuing 
 																		to be 
 																		held 
 																		captive 
 																		by a 
 																		long 
 																		list of 
 																		anxieties 
 																		about 
 																		the 
 																		future, 
 																		Claude 
 																		had 
 																		begun to 
 																		‚Äúeat the 
 																		elephant 
 																		one bite 
 																		at a 
 																		time'‚Äù, 
 																		breaking 
 																		down 
 																		big, 
 																		seemingly 
 																		insurmountable 
 																		problems 
 																		into 
 																		smaller, 
 																		more 
 																		manageable 
 																		portions. 
 																		Each 
 																		week, 
 																		Claude 
 																		would 
 																		confide 
 																		in the 
 																		group, 
 																		discussing 
 																		troubling 
 																		issues, 
 																		weighing 
 																		advice, 
 																		and 
 																		ultimately 
 																		making 
 																		simple, 
 																		reasonable 
 																		decisions. 
 																		As a 
 																		result 
 																		of this 
 																		Claude 
 																		was 
 																		seeing, 
 																		maybe be 
 																		for the 
 																		first 
 																		time in 
 																		his 
 																		life, 
 																		some 
 																		things 
 																		starting 
 																		to turn 
 																		around 
 																		and go 
 																		his way. 
 																		He was 
 																		experiencing 
 																		what 
 																		psychologists 
 																		call 
 																		agency; 
 																		the 
 																		realization 
 																		that he 
 																		had the 
 																		power to 
 																		affect 
 																		his own 
 																		life in 
 																		positive 
 																		productive 
 																		ways.

                                      Elliott 
 																		addressed 
 																		Claude 
 																		saying, 
 																		‚ÄúBrother, 
 																		before I 
 																		leave 
 																		here I 
 																		want you 
 																		to know 
 																		how 
 																		proud I 
 																		am of 
 																		you, and 
 																		how far 
 																		I've 
 																		watched 
 																		you come 
 																		in a 
 																		short 
 																		time. I 
 																		know you 
 																		have 
 																		many 
 																		doubts 
 																		about 
 																		yourself, 
 																		but I've 
 																		been 
 																		privileged 
 																		to see 
 																		you grow 
 																		so 
 																		much!‚Äù 
 																		At this 
 																		point 
 																		Elliott 
 																		unstrapped 
 																		a large 
 																		rugged 
 																		black 
 																		digital 
 																		watch 
 																		from his 
 																		wrist. 
 																		(Being 
 																		paid 32 
 																		cents an 
 																		hour, if 
 																		they're 
 																		fortunate 
 																		enough 
 																		to have 
 																		jobs, 
 																		very few 
 																		inmates 
 																		can save 
 																		enough 
 																		money to 
 																		purchase 
 																		watches 
 																		from the 
 																		prison 
 																		commissary.) 
 																		Elliott 
 																		presented 
 																		the 
 																		watch to 
 																		Claude 
 																		and 
 																		said, ‚ÄúI 
 																		want you 
 																		to have 
 																		this. 
 																		You told 
 																		me once 
 																		how much 
 																		you 
 																		admired 
 																		it. So 
 																		please 
 																		accept 
 																		it as a 
 																		gift 
 																		from me, 
 																		and 
 																		every 
 																		time you 
 																		look at 
 																		it, 
 																		remember 
 																		how much 
 																		I 
 																		believe 
 																		in you". 
 																		Claude's 
 																		eyes 
 																		brimmed 
 																		with 
 																		tears as 
 																		he 
 																		struggled 
 																		to find 
 																		and give 
 																		voice to 
 																		words of 
 																		the most 
 																		profound 
 																		gratitude 
 																		you can 
 																		imagine. 
 																		Other 
 																		guys in 
 																		the 
 																		group 
 																		saw him 
 																		losing 
 																		the 
 																		fight 
 																		for 
 																		composure 
 																		and 
 																		said, 
 																		"It's 
 																		ok, 
 																		man... 
 																		tears 
 																		are 
 																		ok.... 
 																		let 'em 
 																		come.‚Äù 
 																		They 
 																		did. (I 
 																		personally 
 																		hadn‚Äôt 
 																		waited 
 																		for 
 																		permission.)
