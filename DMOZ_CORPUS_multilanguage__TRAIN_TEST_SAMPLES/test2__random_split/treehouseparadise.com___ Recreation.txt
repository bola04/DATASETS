          SMOKE DISCLAIMER: Our Tree Houses are built in live trees, in the forest. Sadly there are occasionally forest fires in our forests.  In the event of a forest fire near us in which we are under any type of evacuation notice or orders, we will attempt to notify you. Sometime smoke from fires a great distance away blows in and obviously when fires are near-by we have smoke intermittent and sometimes most of the day. Usually in even the worst of circumstances, smoke wise, the smoke blows in and out and almost always the afternoons are clear with blue sky, beautiful sunsets and starry nights.  We are not able to control the smoke from forest fires and there are no refunds due to smoke under any circumstances. If you have a medical condition that is effected by poor air quality, our winter cancellation policy applies. If you choose not to arrive or to leave, you will be charged the full amount of your stay, or as per our cancellation policy. There will be no refunds.

                    July 30, 2017 - This was our third time visiting Vertical Horizons, and our first time in the Excalifir, the last time we were here it was still being built and we couldn't wait to come try it out. It completely exceeded all expectations. We could not have asked for more. This was the perfect place to celebrate our friends birthday. Not to mention breakfast was delicious as always. We can't wait to come back! The Wards and The Jackmans

                    8/29/2017 - Thank you so much for a memorable vacation. We started out be checking out the Caves. That experience was enjoyable by all of us, but the excitement from the girls as we drove up to the treehouse was music to this Mom's ears! Jodie was so kind upon our arrival. She helped us pick plums from her tree and my girls ate their fill. The breakfast was AMAZING! We spent day two on the river with Rael from Liquid Expeditions. So Much FUN! Loved every second. Looking forward to round two of breakfast in the morning! Tanks again- Nate, Lauren, Audrey and Eilen Sherman, Wisconson

                    August 12 and 13, 2017 - Jodie, Phil, Tara, and Michael, This was a return visit for us! Last time we stayed in a different treehouse, and we just have to say that this one is gorgeous! This has been another fun and magical stay for us. Thanks for letting us soak in this true paradise! You all make us feel so welcome, so at home. We will definitely be back again soon! :) Faith and Nicko

                    September 5th 2017 - Such good energy here! We decided to spend our time in the area, just chillin here and being. It's a dream come true to be here. I've always wanted to stay in a hardcore treehouse! This treehouse is beyond anything I have ever imagined. We are soaking in our family time, big time right now! Almost 23 weeks pregnant with our second cub. This is our last big holiday just the three of us! It's been perfect! Minus booking the wrong night online for our hotel in Seattle! Hah! But even that was meant to be! Tomorrow we shall continue on our venture! I will never forget this special place. And the surrounding area. Good Vibes, Peaceful, Chill. Much Love!

                    6/15/2016: This place is so special. More than just a beautiful place, pausing the hurried pace of a road trip so we can truly enjoy the peace and serenity, is nourishing to the soul. We came for the Treehouse experience and woven into that experience is the reminder that connecting with others will always change our lives in ways we never expect. Phil may make an awesome breakfast (and he truely does) but it's the amazing sense of community that is created which came as a surprize to us.  Having the same check in / check out days as other guests, we connected over breakfast, then chatted whenever we met during our stay.  It's something seldom experienced in our day-to-day lives. Thank you, Phil and Jodie for sharing this beautiful place. Thank you Michael and Dama, for being part of the team that made our stay AWESOME. This truely is PARADISE!  Paul and Colleen

                    July 2, 3, 4, 2016: This place is so amazing! The
               Calypso is so cozy and adorable. We keep the windows
               open at night to listen to the trees then we wake up
               and eat Phil out of house and home. We did go to Cave
               Juntion to do some hiking and splunking. Then we
               found a spot on the Illinois River. It was gorgeous!
               I normally don't like to do the same vacation twice,
               but I really feel I will have to come back. Thanks
               for having us Phil &amp; Jodie. Hanna &amp; Wade from

                    Oct 28-31 2016: First time to visit the treehouse!!
               Loved it from the time we pulled in to see 3 Doe's in
               the yard. What a beautiful, peaceful place! Every
               waking moment was delightful. Thank you Phil &amp;
               Michael for the wonderful breakfast, great coffee
               &amp; fresh fruit, homemade pancakes and local meats.
               Especially appreciate the clean bathroom showers!
               Thirsty towels &amp; nice soap &amp; good H2o
               pressure!! We enjoyed the local attractions, caves,
               big cats, drive to the coast, local eateries very
               enjoyable too!! See you next time. Sherry &amp; Tammy

                    October 14, 2016 - I proposed to the love of my life at 11:11pm on the upstairs balcony, beneath the light of the full moon, after slow dancing to our favorite songs. The next day, despite monsoon rainfall and hurricane force winds, we drove to Jedidiah Smith to hug Redwood trees. We saw deer, turkeys, and humming birds. Every night we fell asleep holding eachother, listening to the sound of rain and thunder. Treehouses may come and go, but the memories stay forever. This place is magical. P.S. She said YES!

                    June 12 - 14th 2015 ; Probably the coolest B&amp;B we
               have stayed at! Our friends will be so jealous. Next
               time we will have to go tree climbing for sure. I

                    9/10/2015: My wife and I arrived yesterday on our 4th
               wedding anniversary. I must admit the drive from Cave
               Junction seemed like something out of the chainsaw
               massacre. But once we made it here, we realized it
               was completely worth the drive!! The awesome setting,
               fun little animals, spectacular treehouse and great
               hospitality only scratches the surface of how cool
               this place is. Unfortunately we were only able to
               stay one night but will definately be returning.
               Thanks for the awesome memory. Jared &amp; Dana

               down right perfect. Thanks for everything, cant wait
               to be back. This experience was just what we needed.
               Thanks for reminding us about the real values that
               matter in this life. We are blessed to have shared

               totally unique and extraordinary. We needed a total
               disconnect and we had it here. Nature sleeping in a

                    July 24-26 2013 - Thank you so much for such a
               wonderful stay. The Shiitake treehouse was the most
               amazing place we have ever stayed at! We loved the
               beautiful settings, the landscaping and natural
               surroundings are awesome. The breakfast was
               phenomenal. Cosmo and Panzer were super sweet, and
               picking blackberries was great. This is such a great
               change from the usual vacation hustle and bustle.
               Thank you for the moments of peace on our vacation.
               Also thank you for your care of the trees:) - The

                    October 2013 / Thank you for a unique experience in
               the trees. The treehouse is clean, homey, and
               comfortable. I especially was impressed with the
               attention to making us feel like we were at home-
               Coffee, teas,real plates and saucers, etc. Blankets
               were warm, fresh, and snuggling was so cozy!
               Breakfast- ohh we ate too much!! Nice touches in the
               bath house too. We will have great things to say
               about our experience at Vertical Horizons to our
               friends.

                    MAY 1st 2012 Our 2nd Anniversary! - This was our
               first stay in a treehouse and was more amazing than I
               imagined before arriving. We had fun playing
               scrabble, and the breakfast was so delicious. Its
               just really quiet here. Cosmo is great at human
               relations! We really enjoyed seeing him around. This
               was a unique and wonderful stay that we wont forget.

                    August 2012 - We Walked up to our heaven in the trees
               on a warm summer evening. We felt at home immediately
               by our sweet host and hostess! We bonded as a family
               here and felt our childhood camp memories come back!
               Everything was clean and homey! Cosmo kept us safe
               and escorted us to our treehouse every time we came
               back. The breakfast was AMAZING!! I felt like we were
               dinning at the 4 seasons! We will cherish these 2
               days in Oregon forever and hope to come back soon! -

               The beds are so cool. I just can't get over the fact
               that this is a tree house not a hotel room, It's just
               amazing. I love the rope swing, my Mom loves the
               hammock and my Dad likes the blackberry bushes near
               where you park. Thank You! - Sharp Family

                    July 2011 - To the amazing crew at Vertical Horizons:
               We loved staying with you in the cozy Shiitake tree
               house this fall for our honeymoon. Not only was the
               treehouse a beautiful destination in itself, they
               were the perfect place to stay while exploring the
               area around them. Breakfast was off the hook every
               morning and was the perfect fuel for our adventures.
               Thank you for making our honeymoon truly a trip to
               remember. We look forward to staying with you in the
               future. Peace, love, harmony- Tara and Charlie - PS
               It didn't take long for our wedding photographers to
               realize we are a couple of tree huggers. Thought you
               might enjoy this photo.

               goooo- Here we are regretfully spending our last
               morning on the deck of the Cottage! If only we could
               roll back time and start over! Thanks so much to
               all... Phil, Jodie, Roxie, Wendy, Adrian, Cosmo,
               Sadie and all others. We are renewed and ready to
               tackle the trip home. Hard to believe your
               breakfasts,,, we (mom too) ate, ate, and ate. Already
               trying to plan another visit up. Vertical Horizons
               will always have a spot in our hearts and minds. -

                    September 2011 - Such a wonderful trip! Delicious
               breakfast, fun, outdoor games, tree climbing,
               friendly dogs, and most of all sunshine! The
               treehouse was beautiful and was so much fun. Being
               able to watch a mom deer with her baby was a perfect
               view from our deck. Thank you so much for making this
               unique experience unforgettable. The Petersons Jeff,

               interesting places. Your place here is truly WORLD
               CLASS. We've never been anywhere that offered us your
               manifold splendors and we hope to come again and
               again. Thank you for your Spectacular hospitality.

                    March 2011 - As if staying in a treehouse wasn't
               magical enough, our short stay here reached far
               beyond our expectations. Every little detail was
               appreciated. The only thing that we're bummed about
               is that we can't stay longer and explore more. But
               there will definitely be a next time and looking
               forward to many more times beyond that. Your sweet
               tree paradise will go highly recommend in our book.
               Thanks for everything and happy spring! - Kelly, Ryan
               and Iily - PS Ryan proposed to me last night and I
               can't think of a more perfect place for this sweet

                    June 13 and 14 2011 / Peaceful, serene, rejuvenating,
               welcoming. Our stay was all this and more. The scent
               of the trees and the warmth of the family (including
               the animals) make this a one of a kind experience
               that we will always remember and cherish as part of
               our honeymoon. Next time we're out this way from Iowa
               we'll be sure to come back. Thank you so much for the

               family should do this. Family Time! My family
               couldn't have been happier. Such quiet- the tree
               houses were so clean and beautiful. We will tell
               everyone we can do a lot of advertising. Food was
               great. Tree climbing awesome! Thanks so much. Tony

               in your little piece of paradise! We have spent the
               last 2 weeks "road tripping" up the CA/OR coast. We
               have done many activities along the way but this was
               one of the very best! The boys all said they wish we
               would have stayed here much longer (one of them even
               said they wish we would have stayed here the whole
               trip!) This was such a relaxing retreat for all of
               us! Everything was so much fun too. The horseshoe
               games, Disc golf, swinging, exploring, and staring at
               the amazing stars at night! (Don't miss that!) and
               the delicious breakfast. Thanks again for an awesome
               treehouse experience! - The West Family Jay, Kristi,

               tree houses are really nice! I think the shiitakes
               really awesome! I am so surprised that how high the
               house is! Also the beds are really comfy! I love how
               the house is set up, I like the ladder to the beds! I
               like that the windows are so clear, I didn't even
               know they were there! Sincerely, Ben Riggs age 10
               your tree house lover.
                   </p>

                    June 2009 BEST BIRTHDAY EVER! - It started off with a
               wonderful breakfast and then at night I loved going
               climbing with Jodie. Shes right, bubbles are 77 cents
               of pure joy! I love it here. Thank so much! Dayna (13

                    Sunday August 16th 2009 - Oh what an adventure, first
               the tires, then no way to get food :) oh well such is
               our life!! This place is beautiful I'm unable to
               express how excited I am to say I spent the night in
               a tree house! What a wonderful experience this has
               been! Tara will forever be cemented in our minds
               walkin around the corner of your humble abode (bottle
               of wine in hand) coming to save the day! Thank you!

               I've never had so much fun climbing a tree (hehe)

                    Girls Weekend # 4 (Sing to the 'Beverly Hillbillies')
               - Let me tell you all a story about Jackie, shes our
               gal, - For 15 long years, she's been our confidante
               and pal. - So, to celebrate her 40th whatever do we
               buy? - How 'bout a crazy girls weekend, in a
               treehouse, in the sky? - Resort, that is, cabin,
               adventure! - well, the first thing you know we met
               the dogs and such until, - Austin and Jodie came
               around, but where the heck was Phil? - We got a tour
               and found our house, Shiitake was the best! - But how
               to get our stuff from the car up to our nest? - Long
               hike that is, steep path, heavy bags! - Adventure was
               our goal and adventures what we got! We zipped and
               climbed, boated and 'caved', shopped and ate a lot! -
               Enjoy your time, this place is great, we wish that we
               could stay, - fond memories will have to last 'till
               we come back and play! - Next year that is,... -
               Family vacation! - Jackie, Julie, Staci CA.

                    Phil and Jodie 6-19-08 - I thought when my husband
               told me what we were doing that this was gong to be a
               working vacation. I couldn't have been more wrong! It
               took awhile to settle in, but it happened. Now I
               would love to stay longer. I love the walking sticks
               we made. My boys can keep them forever and remember
               staying in the 'Treehouse'. Thanks, K.C, Garrett,
               Grant, Gabriel, Valisha.

                    July 2008 - Thanks for the VIP treatment- Richard
               and; I enjoyed the treehouse, adventures, and your
               company. We can't wait for our girls to get a little
               older so we can bring them! Peace and Love Richard

                    August 2008 / Thanks so much for a wonderful Girl
               Scout troop 4068. They planned a trip to the
               treehouses and worked hard selling girl scout
               cookies, running programs for younger girls to earn
               their money for this trip. We visited the Newport
               aquarium, Oregon caves, did the zip line, and climbed
               trees. Today we are off for a rafting trip on the
               Deschutes. Tomorrow a tour through the safari
               &amp;amp; on home. We/they had a wonderful time here.
               Thanks for your wonderful food and guidance in rope
               climbing up to the tree top and blowing bubbles
               perched up in the trees. It was a great confidence
               builder and adding another notch to their life
               experience. They had fun reminiscing over a bon fire
               and banana boats. Stacy, Aggie, Amy, Zelda, Amber,

                    8-9-08 / What a wonderful location. We came with no
               expectations and were so delighted. The treehouse was
               beautiful- so well crafted and the entire area was so
               well maintained. Our 6 year old, Parker, now would
               like a tree house like this in our yard. Now the
               expectations are set. Thank you for sharing your
               piece of the world with us. It is an experience we
               will not forget. Dan, Emily and Parker
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Phil, Jodie and Austin, Food fantastic, Treehouse
               tremendous, Climbing way cool, especially at night
               with glow sticks and tree chairs! We had a great
               vacation! Thank you for the memories! Alan, Lisa,
               Gavin, Dalton and Liam

                    August 2008 - As our vacation is coming to an end,
               this is for sure one of the most awesome experiences
               we'll be talking about and remembering all the good
               moments I've spent in the 'Shiitake' and everything
               else you have going on for everyone to do. It is
               great to come to a place and everyone just doing
               things they like and enjoying the most. Our Son
               couldn't be happier picking up the fishing pole and
               spending hours out on the ponds. We all looked
               forward to your delicious and huge breakfasts,
               perfect for my kids (big kids) and us of course. We
               truly enjoyed the company of all of you including
               Cosmo and Sadie for hanging out with us. My daughter
               loved petting and playing with them. Phil, thanks for
               all the fishing tips you gave the boys. Jodie,
               Natalie and I enjoyed and learned things about rope
               climbing 'we had no idea about', "Good Luck" and all
               the best with your climbing. "OK!" you guys have a
               great place, thank you for making our stay so
               pleasant and welcoming. We hope to someday return and
               find its peacefulness, tranquility, friendliness and
               freedom. The Castillos Family CA.

                    1/13/2007 - Megan and I actually enjoyed our
               adventure. We are quite probably the first (and
               probably last) to have the pipes freeze. Our host,
               Phil, was quite resourceful though, and we managed
               just fine… We enjoyed 2 great meals as a result and
               got to just stay cozy here. We enjoyed our adventure
               and laughed alot. Thank you so much for the warm
               hospitality and the gourmet meals. We definitely were
               lucky, in our opinion. Helen and Megan Duvernay

                   <p>
                    Phil and Jody, Cave exploring, Hell gate river tours,
               bike riding, fishing, hiking, Frisbee golf! and more
               all of these activities in such close proximity… and
               then to come back to such a beautiful setting at the
               end of each day, to a camp fire, s'mores, sunsets.
               This vacation truly lived up to our expectations and
               we all leave with lifetime memories!! Thank you for
               your hospitality, Mike, Julie, Jackson Jeffery and
               Joseph PS Breakfast was awesome!!

                    July 7th -10th - Dear Phil and Jodie, Thank you so
               much for keeping our stay here a great one! The
               treehouse was awesome and the whole atmosphere is
               very 'enjoyable' Breakfast was great, s'mores were
               great, basically everything was "Great" we'll
               definitely recommend this tree house paradise to
               everyone considering how jealous everyone else is
               about the idea! This is one of the coolest vacations
               I've ever been on! Thanks again for making our stay
               unbelievable! The Voege Family-

                    6/6/06 to 6/10/06 - These tree houses are magical!
               Phil and Jodie you have created something that is
               "very special" here among and in the trees. Thank you
               for making us feel so comfortable and at home - in
               your home. The breakfasts were outstanding, the
               flowers and plants are beautiful on these well kept
               grounds. We are looking forward to returning to the
               relaxing and peaceful tree houses. Thanks again for
               your hospitality- Richard and Mitzi Maxwell -West

                    June 9th, / Phil and Jodie, The Shiitake has been the
               experience of a lifetime for me, especially. Since I
               was a young girl reading Swiss Family Robinson, I
               have dreamed of living in a real tree house. I am 55
               years old now and the closest I've come to an
               experience like this week has been my many visits to
               the 'Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse' in Walt Disney
               world. I've always loved it and have pretended that I
               lived there, even if only for 30 minutes. Really,
               Phil and Jodie, I'm in love with this tree house and
               the whole experience on your beautiful and expansive
               acreage. As if the tree house wasn't enough, your
               friendliness and wonderful hospitality have been
               beyond description. Breakfast has been delicious and
               exciting every day and the daily walks to Takilma
               Road very enjoyable. I can't wait to come back and
               will be dreaming of my tree house until then. Thank
               you! Love Marcy and Jerry Mandello, WPB, FL.

                    6/18/06 - Phil and Jodie, Breakfast was phenomenal!
               Our view was beautiful… Loved the seclusion (and the
               bathroom) Loft beds are comfortable and it was fun
               having a tree trunk right though the middle of
               everything- Thanks for building such an unusual "bed
               and breakfast" We had a great time! Good luck with
               "Rucifer" Sadie and the new hound. Must be fun to
               have so many animals. Steve, Tracy, Jared and Mike

                    July 6th, 7th 2006 / Wow this place is amazing. It is
               so cool how you got a house up here and everything is
               so well done. Breakfast was very yummy, I was getting
               tired of cereal everyday for the past months, it was
               great. I can't believe you built it yourself!
               Everything was awesome. Thank You Alex Brennan

                    7/12/06 - Phil and Jody Incredible!! This trip has
               been in the works for almost a year and the constant
               was, the tree house stop. I'm now the best Grandma in
               the world. My Grandson said this was the best place
               ever. You have thought of everything to make our stay
               so memorable. This is defiantly a repeat. Thank you,

                    7/13/06 - Phil and Jodie, People like you, with the
               vision and endurance to do something like this, make
               life more fun and exciting for people like me. What a
               great place! You have something very special here and
               I'll never forget my night in the treehouse. On a
               more practical note, So clean and your attention to
               detail, welcome note, flowers, decoration,

                    July 4th, 5th, and 6th, 2006 / Dear Jodie and Phil….
               It was a blessing being 'bumped' here to your tree
               house. It has been such an amazing adventure for our
               family. It really forced us to slow down and enjoy
               all of the wonderful surroundings: nature, the deer,
               etc. The kids loved the rope swing and being able to
               just run and play. They also loved having they're own
               space in the loft! We have been pleasantly surprised
               be all that came with staying here with you… The
               fireworks were amazing! The food was fabulous! And
               your hospitality wonderful! It was a great end to sit
               around the fire last night and visit about our
               adventures here in the trees… Thank you so much! The
               girls can't wait to come back next year! We will love
               to share your little paradise with all of our family
               &amp; friends! Sincerely, Kaye, Megan, Myah, and
               Nate. -Albany, OR

                    July 2006 / Phil, Jodie and Austin, Thank you so much
               for this one-of-a-kind stay! It was exactly what our
               family needed after a very busy school year. We loved
               the Cottage Tree house, your gourmet breakfasts, the
               horses, dogs, cats, Rucifer, disk golf, the
               surrounding activities… and especially your warmth
               and hospitality. Thank you. You have truly created an
               oasis for those of us fortunate enough to have found
               you. Take care and maybe we'll see you again. -We'd
               love to come back! Randy, Fay, Karly, Brittany and
               Jenna Goss -Edmonton Alberta, Canada

                    9/1/06 - The tree house was much more than we thought
               it would be. We really enjoyed Phil's Gourmet
               breakfast. It was also a thrill to have deer right
               outside our door. Thanks for the memories. The
               McPherson Family - Jim, Shannon, Zach, Gentry, Sean

                    August 2nd '06 / Phil and Jody, I really enjoyed
               fishing, the breakfasts were great, -Lana We, loved
               living in a treehouse for a few days! Jamie read
               about 'Heidi in the Alps' as she lay by the window in
               the loft, listening to the wind in the trees. The
               details in the tree house are superb. I love the
               number of windows and the fancy ones. The deer with
               her two fauns were a nice added touch too! You have a
               wonderful place and we're glad you are willing to
               share it. Thanks, Maya, Todd, Lana and Jamie Ferris

                    Thanksgiving 2006 / Our little family had a wonderful
               time in your tree house. Cozy and warm, beautiful
               weather -we couldn't have asked for more. Maybe next
               time we will have better luck with no ear infections
               -although finding an urgent care did add to our
               adventure and didn't slow us down much. The redwoods,
               Ashland street lighting, wild cats, -so much to do!
               Thank you for everything- Isak, Lilli, Bill and

                    July, 29th '05 / Had a wonderful time, the experience
               was indeed memorable. Enjoyed the peace and
               tranquility, and lazing about all day. Your
               hospitality and personal touches made the whole
               weekend wonderful. Will recommend to anybody to try.

               house experience was fantastic. You and Jodie showed
               our children your love of nature and animals. Your
               house represents the Hilton of tree-houses. Your
               breakfast and facilities are absolutely fabulous!!
               Your hospitality and flexibility made our trip here
               wonderful and adventuresome for our children. Thank
               you for our first and best experience in this area!
               Your restaurant, adventure "things to do and see"

               Your casual professionalism was just what we need at
               the end of a long, eventful (but wonderful) vacation.
               The food, the stories, the enthusiasm were all happy
               exclamation marks to one of our best holidays ever.
               With out doubt, too, your tree house will be the
               highlight of the trip. We happened on you by
               accident, but will return soon on purpose. The

               husbands 60th birthday, we both needed this kind of
               peaceful, serene R and R. Beautiful treehouse, great
               hospitality! Haven't had breakfast yet but judging by
               everyone's comments we are so looking forward to it.
               Thank you for a wonderful get-away! (Tom) A really
               great time in a beautiful area. Your treehouses are a
               plan being carried out to perfection. Thanks for
               making it so special. Oh Yeah, the breakfast left me

                    September 2005 / Our long wait to get here is over,
               and now, so is our three day stay. The wait was worth
               it. We have enjoyed the whole experience. Time went
               by too quickly. Nick and Rachel enjoyed all the
               animals and seeing the deer pass through everyday. We
               probably should have done a few things in the area,
               but no one wanted to leave. Thanks for everything-

                    Wow, the third guests! What a privilege! We loved it!
               Everything was wonderful the treehouse was simply
               adorable, very romantic; like a "doll house" We love
               the high quality craftsmanship and your attention to
               detail is superb! Great location, excellent food and
               very nice family. You will be very successful in your
               new business with the other treehouses. Loved the
               breakfasts!! We thank you for your hospitality. We
               are looking forward to watching your progress; we
               will highly recommend this place to our friends in
               Los Angeles; our kids loved the dogs, the fishing
               pond, the French toast and your warm and friendly
               attitude. Thank you for making our vacation a
               memorable one. The Lyons Family -

                   <p>
                    I have always wanted a doll house or a treehouse; a
               'cozy place' of my own. Now that I've had it, I don't
               want to leave! I would like to bring up a 'trunk of
               books, stock the fridge with yogurt, and stay for a
               month soaking up the quietness. Since we live on a
               busy street in Portland, you can't imagine how
               pleasant the absence of traffic noise is; just
               hearing the rustle of wind in the trees, birds
               chirping and deer brushing through the undergrowth.
               In the background there is a piano playing coming
               from the house- a wonderful backdrop- I think this is
               very generous that you have this hideaway and yet are
               willing to share it with strangers- and welcome them
               to your patio, and kitchen table. It's remarkable
               that you all are so willing to share yourselves with
               us. Blessings, The Chandlers

                    Our treehouses as kids were nothing like yours! This
               place is beautiful, peaceful; cozy; amazingly
               crafted, and so much fun. What a wonderful way to
               spend our belated 7th anniversary! Thanks to your
               warm hospitality, great company and deliciously
               prepared breakfast, we don't want to leave!! Looking
               forward to your new creations among the trees, Phil
               we plan on staying in each one. Thanks again Phil,
               Tara, and Jodie for a well needed getaway!

                    We have stayed four wonderful days here with the
               quiet early mornings so crisp, and the clear nights
               with limitless stars aglow have made our trip truly
               remarkable with the best breakfasts we've ever had,
               but mostly w/ your hospitality. The small things like
               maps and signs welcoming us are so special and
               heartfelt (are you sure you're not from the south) I
               will cherish our discussions on the local culture.

                    Phil and Jodie, Are you sure you're not from the
               south? This "Tree-sort' oozes with true southern
               hospitality, from the 5***** breakfast down to the
               warm welcome of the flowers and signs. Thank you for
               the quiet respite and pause in our crazy schedules.
               It was wonderful to visit with you at breakfast and
               hear about your dreams and schemes for the future -
               May you prosper and do well in every endeavor.
               Blessings to you both! We'll definitely spread the
