         <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: center;">
          <em>
           To a Fayetteville resident ready for an
           <br/>
           amazing experience with martial arts,
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
          Many years ago, I was like you. I hadn't thrown a kick or a punch. Martial arts seemed as foreign as the far eastern countries it came from. Yet, for some reason, I was drawn toward these arts. Something pulled me in.
         </p>
         <p>
          Years later—after lots of intense training—I became a master in my art. But that wasn't enough for me. In the same way I was drawn to learn martial arts, I felt a calling to teach it and pass on its timeless lessons to our community.
         </p>
         <p>
          Along the way, I learned how to give my students the best experience possible. Here's what you can expect when you walk through our doors:
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           The Best Instructors You'll Ever Encounter.
          </strong>
          <br/>
          A great teacher is essential for a transforming experience. Our instructors are hand-picked for their passion, expertise, and for their desire to teach the profound lessons of martial arts to all who would listen.
         </p>
         <p>
          They're eager to help you learn and grow. They'll push you to surpass your limits, challenge you to rise above challenges, and answer any and all questions you have along the way.
         </p>
         <p>
          They're patient, knowledgeable, and there for you.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           An Uplifting, Clean &amp; Safe Environment.
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Next, it's critical that our facility be clean, safe and a positive environment. After all, the best instructors can't make up for dirt, grime, broken equipment and an out-dated atmosphere. The entire studio is cleaned daily - and very rigorously too. We scrub the mats, sweep and mop the floors, wipe down the equipment and more.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you walk in, you'll walk into a clean space that breathes support and positivity. And you'll instantly know that this is a place for reaching goals and achieving success.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Community.
          </strong>
          <br/>
          And finally, community is the final ingredient. Our instructors and facility are the perfect environment for people to come together, encourage each other, and help each other learn and grow. Veteran members help out beginners in learning. People partner up for exercises, and motivate each other to try their hardest.
         </p>
         <p>
          And often, entire families train here. After all, we have kids and adult programs, and often parents train with adults while their children learn and grow with other kids.
         </p>
         <img alt="Academy of Christian Martial Arts Logo" class="logo" src="images/pages/logo.png"/>
         <p>
          On this website, you'll learn more about our programs and our school so you can decide if you feel we're a good fit. You'll have the option to try out our classes with an amazing, risk-free offer. That way you can come into our studio and make sure, firsthand, we're the right school for you.
         </p>
         <p>
          I can't wait for the opportunity to help you master the martial arts.
         </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           Our classes are result-focused and there are an array of fun activities and games for kids of all ages. Every age is perfectly catered for and the kids love these classes as they perfect their martial arts techniques and learn new ones.

           Krav Maga
          </h2>
          <p>
           Our Fayetteville Krav Maga classes are developed from the mid-1930s Jewish / Israeli history. In those years, anti-Semitic thugs dominated Bratislava and terrorized Jewish citizens. But a man named Imi Sde-Or, also Jewish, became their champion by defending them on the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
           Imi Sde-Or, in his many street fights, realized that boxing and wrestling had no place in the “real world”. He was an olympic contender in both, so no one knew boxing and wrestling better than he did. He took his experience on the street, combined it with what he already knew, and  developed Krav Maga; a unique type of self-defense that utilizes natural instincts for self-protection. Get fit and develop self-defense by joining our Fayetteville Krav Maga classes.
