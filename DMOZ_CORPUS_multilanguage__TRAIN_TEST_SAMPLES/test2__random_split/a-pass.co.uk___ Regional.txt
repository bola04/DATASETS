         After having lessons with previous instructors A-Pass was definitely the best. The company’s overall service was top notch with both the practical and theory side. The instructor was calm, patient and positive with me with regards to all my lessons. When I made mistakes I was instructed on how to correct them in a productive and non-critical manner that made me feel at ease about my lessons and really confident going into my test.

        <p>
         So at the age of 25 i had really given up hope of ever passing my driving test, after 3 failed attempts over the years and the fact my mum passed on her 9th attempt i definitely though i was doomed. But then i started lessons with A-Pass i was astonished at how relaxed i felt being behind the wheel again. My past instructors had made me feel nervous finishing each lesson dreading the next one. However with A-Pass this had all vanished, i actually looked forward to my lessons! I started my lessons in February and by April my instructor advised me to book my test…at first i though he was crazy, but each week we would drive round the areas that might be covered in the test to get me familiar with the area, this was really beneficial as when it came to my test i felt confident on the roads i was driving on. Each lesson was tailored to my needs, and my instructor was happy to recap anything, all i had to do was ask. So after 4 months i sat my test and passed FIRST TIME!!!
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Thanks you A-Pass!!

         After years of trying different driving schools and hating every lesson, I came across A Pass, I was so nervous I thought I would never pass but after a few lessons I was told that I was not as bad as I thought, previously I had gone through 3 instructors, none of which put me at ease, if anything they put me off more, at age 34 I thought it would take years of lessons but after 6 months I had passed 1st time, I was actively encouraged to book my test, I thought he was mad but turns out he was right, even my bad habits were changed with gentle correction each week, meeting A Pass has changed my life, I wish I had meet them first, can’t thank them enough.

         Honestly, learning how to drive can be demanding, especially when you drive before in another country. I felt reluctant at first to learn all over again but when I got my new job as an IT Analyst, it wasn’t easy waking up very early every morning to catch buses to work. – See? I have to drive, so I had to learn. Glad I met the right Driving Instructor – Mr. Mac who patiently gave his time and attention to me. I think he believed in me, so when I failed the first and second time, he wasn’t that bothered. The experience with him was wonderful, esp. with his drawing skills of analysing the roads, road markings, round abouts etc. sometimes I laugh inside me at his drawings…but indeed, they were very helpful. patience is a key, i learnt from him. Now I’ve passed – When I passed, my examiner said;” you seem surprise, you’re a good driver, why you surprise?” — I wouldn’t have been a better driver if not for Mr. Mac; A-Pass. Thanks guys.

         I have changed a few driving instructors with different companies over the past couple of years. From some of the well known company like AA to private instructors. I have had some really bad experience such as getting sworn at with foul languages in my first few driving lesson. It is also the main reason why I have left it until now to do the driving test.I have to do due to work. Anyway, I have signed up for Apass, didn’t know much about it as I believe It doesn’t matter how much you paid for your instructor and how big the companies are, It is really down to the instructors who teaches you as they are the one who are going to be there as a guidance and help you to go through each of the small steps until you passed your test. All I want to say is Jamie from Apass is an excellent driving instructors, He really put me at ease and taught me how to be a better driver, Yet, I have failed three driving tests in a row but It has nothing to do with how he taught me… it was all due to all the nerve and panicking and I messed it up. Anyway, I have passed my test today, Jamie is a absolutely amazing guy, He is in his early thirties but really patient kinda guy, put you at ease and wouldn’t shout at you even you made some serious silly mistakes in your lesson. So yeah highly recommend Jamie.

         When starting lessons, I found A-Pass to be very flexible and this was great as I did not have to worry about driving clashing with my school schedule. My instructor kept a constant record of the lessons and my progress throughout the process, which was incredibly useful as we were able to work on my weaker areas and perfect whatever I struggled with. A-Pass also showed me the various possible test routes and demonstrated the common mistakes made by other pupils so that I would not make the same errors. This was extremely valuable because it ensured that I was comfortable with every possible route before my test and was as prepared as I could’ve been. The best thing about A-Pass however was that towards the end, my instructor informed me that I was well prepared for the test and even suggested that I should reduce the hours I was doing each week to help me save money. I thought that this was very honest of A-Pass and doubt that other driving schools would go as far to help their students.

         In the end, I passed my test first-time with only three minor faults, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of A-Pass. I was first suggested and informed of A-Pass by a close friend of mine and I will be doing the same in the future as I had such a good experience. Thanks a lot to A-Pass and I strongly recommend that anyone looking to learn to drive use this school.

         My experience was pretty good on the whole. Instructor was good and informative (perhaps a little nitpicky but all for the correct reasons). By the end I was test-ready but still had time so he offered to lessen the hours spent on learning in order to save money.

         All in all. Good, competitive pricing and shows you everything you need to know. My only negative would be that I thought renting the car for the test was the price of two lessons .. however mine was almost as much as 3 lessons. However I did pass first time so I’m not too bothered about it right now! 😀

         Great experience with A Pass! Previously only taking 10 hours, I was bold to take just another 12 but I had a great response. My instructor was very patient with me and accommodated to my specific needs of how I like to learn. Overall amazing job, thank you!!

         Been taking lessons for a while now, definitely would recommend this school. Great help with theory, and teaching style is enjoyable, good price per hour as well and definitely has helped me prepare for my driving test, friendly and helpful advice from what I’d rate as a five star instructor

         Excellent service from Mak at A Pass Driving.  Got my daughter through her driving test in good time and really instilled confidence in my daughters driving ability throughout.
