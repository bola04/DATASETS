              Sir 
   David Attenborough said, "
              <em>
               Albatrosses have survived in the harshest 
   marine environments for 50 million years; more than 100 times longer than our 
   own species. However, these magnificent birds are unable to cope with man-made 
   threats, such as longline fishing. Europeans saw their first albatrosses only 
   500 years ago in the Southern Ocean, but in our fleeting overlap with these 
   birds we are threatening all but two of the worldâs 21 species with extinction. 
   It is awe-inspiring to think that some of the albatrosses nesting when I started 
   my broadcasting career are still raising young, half a century later. However, 
   with 100,000 of these birds drowning annually on longlines, the chance of an 
   individual albatross surviving to old age now, seems as remote as the ability 
   of many albatross species to exist beyond the end of this century. Albatrosses 
   should be free to circle the globe for millions of years to come â we 
   must stop this needless slaughter now to prevent an entire branch being torn 
   from the evolutionary tree. It is unthinkable that the only record we will have 
   of these birds will be the attempts of broadcasters, like myself, to share the 
   beauty of our natural world.

   boat when actively fishing and using a plastic shoot to drop baited hooks into 
   the water are highly effective in reducing seabird mortality. There really are 
   no excuses for not making this standard practice worldwide (Added 8 Oct 2005).

         Transoceanic 
   Migrations - Interconnections between populations of Great White Sharks.
         <br/>
         <font size="3">
          An article in the journal
          <em>
           Science
          </em>
          (7 October 2005: 100-103) 
   described recent satellite tagging studies that reveal an unexpectedly long 
   and rapid migration by Great White Sharks across the Indian Ocean. One adult 
   female (nick-named Nicole after Australian actress Nicole Kidman) was tagged 
   on 7 November 2003 by a team headed by Ramon Bonfil, a scientist with the Wildlife 
   Conservation Society. 'Nicole' spent some time in South African waters before 
   embarking on a 6,900 mile journey straight across the Indian Ocean to western 
   Australia. During this time, the shark made a number of deep dives (up to 3,215 
   feet) but otherwise spent 61% of the time close to the surface. The satellite 
   device detached itself 99 days later (to allow for collection of the stored 
   data) a mile from shore just south of the Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia. 
   Remarkably, the same shark was resighted off South Africa on 20 August 2004. 
   Other animals in the study did not follow the same path but instead moved up 
   and down the East African coast, including Mozambiquan Territorial waters where 
   they are not protected. These results suggest that the different populations 
   of Great White Sharks may be significantly more interconnected that previously 
   thought and that depletion of one stock will therefore directly impact others 
   (Added 8 Oct 2005).

       have just announced an exclusive seabirding 
   adventure through the Western Pacific. Sailing from New Zealand, the cruise 
   will thread its way through the numerous islands of the western Pacific to Kagoshima 
   in Japan. For seabird fanatics this is the proverbial 'once in a lifetime' chance 
   to connect with a host of stunning seabirds including the newly rediscovered 
   New Zealand Storm-Petrel and numerous tropical goodies such as Tahiti Petrel, 
   Gouldâs Petrel, White-necked Petrel, Heinrothâs Shearwater, White-throated 
   Storm-Petrel and Grey Ternlet. The trip will culminate with a visit to Torishima, 
   the principal nesting site for Short-tailed Albatross. A number of landings 
   are planned and participants will encounter numerous hard-to-get landbirds including 
   the awesome Kagu on Noumea in New Caledonia.

      'Most humans have never 
   seen a
      <a href="http://www.oceanwanderers.com/Gryh.Alb.html">
       gray-headed albatross
      </a>
      or, for that matter, any albatross. And for good reason. The gray-headed albatross 
   breeds in grassy tufts set high on the cliffs of remote islands in the seas 
   just north of Antarctica. But the bird's true habitat is the tumultuous air 
   above those seas. In April 1999, scientists fixed tiny locaters to the albatrosses 
   in a cohort breeding on Bird Island, near South Georgia. The data retrieved 
   - a map of the migratory patterns of 22 birds - will help scientists understand 
   where albatrosses are most likely to cross paths with fishing boats, which often 
   hook and kill the birds with baited hooks floating just under the water's surface. 
   That could make all the difference to this species, which belongs to the most 
   threatened family of birds on the planet.'
      <br/>
      <br/>
      'This research also turned up some surprising glimpses of how albatrosses live. 
   It was already known that they could fly at astonishingly high speeds with Antarctic 
   storms at their backs, and scientists had guessed that the birds were capable 
   of spending great lengths of time aloft. But half the birds in this study flew 
   around the world - as much as 14,000 miles - and one of them did so in 46 days. 
   This implies an ability simply to live on the wing, to rest and forage while 
   making constant headway toward the east and, ultimately, their breeding grounds.'
      <br/>
      <br/>
      'As so often happens, the more we come to know about the life of any individual 
   species, the better we understand how extensive the human impact on this planet 
   really is. Few things seem more remote from our daily lives than the peregrinations 
   of an albatross in the southernmost latitudes. And yet those birds, when they 
   feed, are all too often the immediate victims of our appetite for fish.'
      <br/>
      <br/>
      'It's hard to say how many albatrosses are lost to legal and illegal long-lining 
   ships, which trail enormous numbers of baited hooks behind them. But some estimates 
   say they kill as many as 100,000 birds per year. The long-lining fishing fleet 
   is overharvesting the air as well as the sea.' (Added 20 Jan 2005)

      An estimated 300,000 seabirds 
   die from longlining each year. One goal of the project is to encourage more 
   countries to sign the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
   (ACAP). ACAP requires signatory states to take specific measures to reduce seabird 
   by-catch from longline fishing and improve the conservation status of the birds. 
   Initially, only Australia, New Zealand, Ecuador, Spain and South Africa signed 
   the agreement. The UK became the sixth country to ratify in April 2004. Ratification 
   by the UK included the Overseas Territories of the Falklands, British Antarctic 
   Territory and South Georgia/South Sandwich Islands but not Tristan da Cunha, 
   which is crucial and which is due to ratify soon. Most pirate fishing vessels

       The world 
   of seabirds is always full of great surprises. Earlier this year (25th January 
   2003) a group of pelagic birders led by Brent Stephenson and Sav Saville (
       <a href="http://www.wrybill-tours.com/">
        Wrybill 
   Birding Tours
       </a>

   storm-petrel (above). Hitting the books, they came to the heady conclusion that 
   this might be the supposedly extinct and certainly very poorly known New Zealand 
   Storm-Petrel
       <i>
        Oceanites maorianus
       </i>
       . Review of the type specimen at the 
   British Museum in Tring by Hadoram Shirihai and Bill Bourne strongly supports 
   this identification. There almost no information on the natural history of this 
   obscure seabird and there are only three specimens in existence, one at Tring 
   and two in Paris. You can learn more about this extraordinary sighting and view 
   Ian Southey's photos of all three specimens by visiting the dedicated page on

      So is the Whitianga bird 
   a one off? The last of its kind? Apparently not! The thrilling news is that 
   Bob Flood and Bryan Thomas, visiting birders from the UK, observed and photographed 
   a flock of New Zealand Storm-Petrels off Little Barrier Island on 17 November 
   2003. They saw 10 birds together, with up to 20 different birds visiting their 
   chum slick over a period of 2 hours. An article on this exciting new development,

       To view the many images on this site, set your 
   monitor to 'real colors' or 'thousands of colors'. The pages may load a tiny 
   bit slower but believe me it makes quite a difference to the image quality!
