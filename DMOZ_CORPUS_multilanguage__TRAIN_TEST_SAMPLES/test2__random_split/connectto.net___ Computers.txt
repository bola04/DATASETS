          Data compression allows web pages and email to be delivered at compressed levels, which increase the data limit of your plan. Compression DOES NOT WORK on streaming video nor streaming audio, so if you do a lot of that, you may need a higher limit plan.

       Each user receives up to 5 email addresses. You can use these for various members of your family or for whatever purpose you choose. Each mailbox is allocated 20MB of disk space.
       <p>
        You can use any standard mail program, such as Outlook Express, Eudora, or Netscape to receive your mail. Or you can use our advanced WEBMAIL technology at no additional cost.
       </p>
       <p>
        WEBMAIL has several advantages: 
 No setup is required. 
 You can get your mail from any computer and from any location. 
 WEBMAIL does not download your mail to your computer before you can review it. WEBMAIL only downloads the Subject and the name of the sender. You can delete unwanted mail without the wasted time of having to download it.
       </p>
       <p>
        WEBMAIL provides unprecendented protection against email transmitted viruses. Since emails are not downloaded to your computer until you request them, you can delete suspicious emails without any chance of infecting your computer. Other mail programs may infect your computer with viruses before you can even delete them.
