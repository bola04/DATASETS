      When you shake hands with Jack Vestal these days, you notice quickly that he has a really firm grip for a man soon to turn 100. If your imagination went into overdrive, you could imagine him squeezing tighter and maybe you’d hear the sounds of bones breaking.
      <br/>
      But he keeps the handshake firm, and friendly. Just as firm and friendly as the light in his eyes.
      <br/>
      At the cusp of becoming a centurian in his life, Jack nagivates the room in his home on Quail Valley with a walker, but with firm steps and a regal posture, his prose simple and direct. He is a stately man that, as he says “Has been there, done that.”

      With severe weather forecast for Saturday’s UIL Region Marching Contest at Memorial Stadium in Wichita Falls, the original schedule was altered to include bands normally competing that afternoon.
      <br/>
      Iowa Park’s Mean Green Marching Machine was to be the fourth band on the field, following 5A schools Wichita Falls Old High and Rider High School, and 4A Burkburnett.
      <br/>
      Prior to Burkburnett taking the field, the Class 5A results were announced, with the Coyote Band earning a Superior “I” rating, and the Raider Band a “II”.
      <br/>
      Those results provided an early indication that the three judges were going to wear a critical eye throughout the day.
      <br/>
      With that in mind, Saturday was a big win in many ways for the Mean Green Marching Machine, as the Hawk Band’s performance earned them a Superior “I” rating, continuing a legacy that stretches back 36 years

       – The bi-district playoff game between Iowa Park and Mineral Wells, originally scheduled for 8 p.m. Friday, has been rescheduled for 5 p.m. Saturday in Bowie.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Iowa Park’s top-ranked and unbeaten Hawk baseball team has accomplished two major goals already in the 2015 season – win the District 5-4A championship, and win it by going 9-0.
       <br/>
       Now comes “the funnest part” of the season, according to Coach Michael Swenson ... the state playoffs, when it is down to “win or go home.”..

      It is often hard to pin down why things go viral on the internet, like a video or photo. Often it is a random event captured by a lens that, once posted, takes on a life of its own. Before you know it, the image(s) have been seen by tens of thousands on Facebook and in emails. The best just happen by accident with perfect timing and the luck of good content, and can rarely if at all be pre-constructed.

      If the Iowa Park School Bond Proposal in the amount of $14.7 million is passed May 12, how will the bond be paid for?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      That is a good question, and the answer has a few elements to be addressed.
      <br/>
      First the tax rate. The estimated tax increase of this bond is .21 cents for a total tax rate of $1.34 (the current tax rate is $1.13). For a home valued at $100,000, this represents an increase of approximately $17 per month.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      However, if you are over the age of 65 or disabled, and successfully filed the appropriate application, school taxes are frozen on your home and will not increase as long as you own and occupy the home ....
