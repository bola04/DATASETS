    Pickle Ball in New Zealand
   </p>
   <p class="style1">
    I became fond of this game in 2014. In NZ, I've enjoy playing pickleball at various badminton centers, gyms and some  outdoor courts. Pickleball began to take off in NZ in 2015. It is now being played at a number of centers, as given on the Pickleball.org.nz site.
   </p>
   <p class="style1">
    I moved here in November of 2017. Living in Auckland, where the majority of Kiwis live, I was surprised that pickleball was only being played regularly at night in two northern suburbs. In 2018, that has been changing. We now play pickleball during the day in two indoor and one outdoor venue in central parts of Auckland. There is an email discussion list (completely non-commercial, 'bot and spam-free) to coordinate play among Aucklanders. Feel free to join in the conversation:
