        </span>
        is a well respected family business located near Tonbridge in Kent established for over 40 years, we are always keen to explain the advantage of purchasing antique carpets. The all important factors being condition, genuine age, and origin. Once they become worn and damaged the value decreases dramatically. We have customers world wide including top interior decorators and designers.

       <p>
        We specialize in mostly 19th century tribal and village hand woven pieces made with vegetable dyes all totally unique individual works of art,
