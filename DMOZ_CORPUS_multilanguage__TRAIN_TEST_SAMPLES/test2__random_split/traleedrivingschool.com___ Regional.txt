     Having practised as an Approved Driving  Instructor (A.D.I.) in the UK, I have established a driving school in  the Tralee area, which I know very well.
     <br/>
     <p>
      I aim to give the best possible value  to every person who takes driving lessons with me and to teach  driving skills to the highest standard. I aim to bring you to driving  test standard as soon as possible.
