           <br/>
           It is not true that the World Bank stated, “GIVE ME CONTROL OF A  NATION’S WEALTH AND I CARE NOT WHO MAKES ITS LAWS.” In fact, historians are  still searching for the original author of that quote. However, is the World Bank not  dictating onerous policies for poor countries such as Liberia, for example,  since it came into existence in 1943? For example, was it not the World Bank  that guided Liberia in awarding 66 fraudulent concessionary agreements such as  the ExxonMobil concessionary agreement, according to Mr. Robert Sirleaf, son of  former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf?

           The Liberian economy is on life-support. The local currency  (LRD) is fast losing weight or power as a result of the growing demand for  foreign currency (USD). There is a huge rush for foreign currency (USD) by both  the private and public sectors. Real income, investment, and employment are  being negatively impacted due to rising prices (inflation), swelling exchange  rate, and global macroeconomic shocks.

           In the wake of the worsening  economic condition, the lowering of living standards, the scaling down of  investment, the implacable unemployment and permanent inflation that are taking  a toll on the mass of people in the homeland, the people have slammed the Weah  government for being insensitive. Some have virtually poured scorn on it,  calling it into question and thus submitting that it is an orgy of
           <em>
            deplorables
           </em>
           .  The condemnation trended on social media and it sparked a national outcry, and  the discussion became a cause célèbre.

           A few days ago, in South Africa--the Rainbow Nation—as  their late president famously tagged it—dignitaries and ordinary citizens from  around the world are joining hundreds of thousands of South Africans for their  highly anticipated Global Citizens Festival, in commemoration of the 100th  anniversary of the birth of their late President, Mr. Nelson Rolihlahla  Mandela. From all indications, the festivities are definitely star-studded.

           What  factor(s) continue to depreciate the Liberian currency against the American  currency? The rate was LD 54 to the US $1  in 2005; LD 131 to the U.S. $1 in 2017; and  now it is LD160 to the US $1 in 2018.  Former Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL), Mr. Milton Weeks, during  a Press Conference in 2017, asserted that the outflow of $144 million  remittances was the culprit. In 2016, former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  implied that a decline in the global commodity prices was the reason behind the  fall in government revenue, and by extension the Liberian Exchange rate...Adding to  the two factors, the International Monetary Fund listed ULMIL drawdown,  reduction in inflow remittances, a sharp reduction  in donors’ grants and the political uncertainty in 2017. Additionally, the IMF,  in its June 8, 2018, Report No. 18/172,  accused CBL of abandoning its  responsibility to stabilize Liberia’s exchange rate. “The  CBL has not attempted… at providing the funds needed to intervene in the  foreign exchange market to smooth the depreciation path of the LD against the  USD,” explained by the author of the Report.

           In the wake of the  geometrical progression of the exchange rate, compounded by the worsening  living standards in the homeland, a looming crisis is on the horizon in Liberia.  However, our friends on the campus in the geographic propinquity of Bernard  Beach are either on “jolly” or watching television soap opera or in the state of denial. At least the ordinary people, who learn  from experience, are seeing through the scheme and thus disassociating  themselves from the so-called pro-poor chorus. The once duped people now agree  with progressive nationalists that the Weah presidency is sliding the homeland  into political sclerosis and social disintegration.

           Everywhere in Liberia, the  social crisis has reached its terminal stage. There is massive unemployment  with no prospect of increasing the productivity of labor through productive  economic activities in key sectors of the economy. The living standards of the  mass of people cannot withstand the shock being produced by the general rise in  the prices of goods and services. The low supply of foreign currency in the  economy has made the Liberian dollars a mere paper on the desk of a public-school  teacher. Due to lack of productivity in the industrial sector of the economy,  almost 95percent of consumer goods are imported into the country from external  economies.

           It is hard to bid final  goodbye to a longtime friend,  undergraduate and graduate schoolmate,  Dean and professional colleague. Our relationship was contextual, self-reinforcing,  and professional.   William Shakespeare  reminds us in the Tempest that " What is Past is Prologue," meaning,  in the sense used here, that the historical context of one’s upbringing and school  days, determine the successes of his or her career in the future, a future that  I shared with my departed friend, who I came personally to know as Boy Boko or  Dave.

           Just like his predecessors, President Weah is faced with  the tasks to make a decision between of what Professor, Dr. Nicola  Fuchs-Schundeln called “Self-Interest vs. the Common Good.” For instance, did  the government award the concessionary agreement to Hummingbird Resources  because of Special Interest such as the World Bank, Liberia’s lender, and economic adviser? Or, will the government  protect the interest of Monrovia-Landlords against the interest of tenants,  will the government differentiate some desired bonus payments from bribery; will  the government prevent concessionary companies from polluting communities or  exploiting Liberia natural resources?

In his Statement, made over the weekend, Dr.  Tipoteh, an internationally renowned economist, said that the Hut Tax is regressive  and, therefore, it would increase the already longstanding and widespread  poverty in Liberia.

           The reelection of Turkey’s President Erdogan, falsely considered  to be free, fair, and representative of the will of the majority of the Turkish  population has dire implications both  domestic and foreign. Supporters of Erdogan suggest that the elections only  reinforce the democratic nature of the country and that critics of Erdogan must  now accept the public verdict. The fact, however, is that Erdogan stopped short  of nothing to create an internal social and political atmosphere to stifle his  opposition that made it possible for him to win an outright majority of the  electorate. This raises serious questions about the legitimacy of his victory  that has bestowed on him sweeping powers and made Turkey de facto one-man rule.  Nothing will stop him now from pursuing his abusive and blind ambition, as he  can now exercise absolute power.

           Pro-Poor  Policy of a government usually targets directly poor people’s economic plight,  which is due to the poverty they experienced in society. The goal of this  policy is to improve their living standard. However, the Hut Tax re-introduced by  the traditional Chiefs and Elders in Liberia resembles a reversed ‘Robin Hood’ –  intended to TAKE (Steal) from the POOR. Whereas, the Robin Hood and his Merry  Men of

           The most vexing  perennial and pervasive problem in Liberia is mass poverty. Mass poverty has  become a principal pretext for violence,  including war, as was seen in the Liberian Civil War. Out of this Civil War has  emerged the clear Mandate of the People of Liberia, indicative of lessons well  learned from the experiences during the Civil War. This Mandate remains: WE  WANT PEACE! NO MORE WAR!

           The current debate in  Liberia is centered on two loans that the infant administration of President  George M. Weah has entered with certain private entities to undertake the  construction of roads in the Southeast and in Eastern Liberia. Anyone who spent  16 hours to cover a rocky 500 kilometers – as I did a few times this year - will  wholeheartedly welcome any alternative. A drive on the bush road from Buchanan  in Bassa County to Pleebo in Maryland is akin to a trip into the abyss of time  past. For people in that region, the prospect of a modern road that would link  them to the rest of the country, trumps  any other consideration.

           In  a show of a bombastic display of PowerPoint presentation in a spacious room  packed with curious Liberians in Philadelphia earlier this spring, President Weah's finance minister Samuel Tweah implicitly  hinted that the much-heralded pro-poor  policy agenda of the Weah administration was an ad hoc one in that it was  scarcely conceptualized or put on paper. The Finance  Minister was responding to a question from the Philadelphia audience regarding  the policy agenda. He then said the administration would be issuing a comprehensive  concept paper or a white paper that would contain explanations of what the  agenda is all about--in June this year.

           Have you heard the adage, which says, “The Tail Wags The Dog,” meaning  the tail of a dog that drives flies away from a dog is the same tail that wags/slaps  the dog? Or, the law that affects a citizen is the same law that affects a government.  Without such a rule, the bank industry would enable criminals/drug dealers to  change “Bad Money” to “Good Money.” In the case of the $536M, the banking rule  that requires a depositor to provide a source  for a deposit of $10,000 or above is the same rule that requires a government and  its lender to provide the source for the $536M loan.

           There  is common Liberian saying that town trap is not for rat alone. Another common  Liberian saying is that if you point you  finger to someone, four of your fingers are pointed back to you.  The wisdom in these statements are playing themselves out right in our faces  in relation to how the government of President George Weah is proceeding with  agreements and concessions signed by the past government versus how they are  proceeding in concluding new agreements, especially the US$536 million ETON and  the US$420 EBOMAF loan deals.

           We don't have faith in the collective of membership of the Liberian legislature. The  whole legislature is a façade. Apart from the specious filibustering and boring  antic, the legislature has always been  subservient and played second fiddle to every Liberian leader. A rubber stamp  institution it is, thus making it anachronistic in the context of check and  balance. In true, check and balance, in the context of Liberia, is only on the  paper. The reality is different. The legislature is just burden taxpayers have to shoulder to make  Liberia appears like it has a democracy with three separate but equal branches.

           Is that Emmanuel Shaw, again? That was my reaction to a picture in  which the French President, Emmanuel Macron, and Emmanuel Shaw were standing  side by side and smiling. Both appeared as if they were former schoolmates  meeting at a class reunion gathering. But, this was not at a class reunion  gathering. It was at a reception hosted by the French president in Paris for  his visiting Liberian counterpart, President George Weah. Mr. Shaw, however,  was not there, as other Liberian citizens were, to pay their respects to  President Weah. Rather, Shaw was there as a member of the official Liberian  delegation that was headed by the president. Hence, one can conclude that Shaw  was selected by Weah to travel with him. Although it has not been announced  publicly, one will not be wrong to also conclude that Shaw is an official in  the Liberian government. For an administration that portrays itself to the  world to be “pro-poor,” Shaw’s  involvement in it, perhaps, with what appears to be unrestricted access to the  president, does not inspire confidence in the commitment to the “pro-poor” agenda. Why do I make this assertion?

           In a conversation with an Arcelor Mittal contractor, I was  told that Arcelor Mittal has had to cut back on production and exportation of Liberian  iron ore because of the fall of iron ore price on the world market.  That took me off guard because it simply just didn’t make sense.  Why would Arcelor dare do such an unthinkable  thing when it made more sense to pay a lower price for one's inputs (iron ore) into its steel production, especially when  steel price was going UP.  So I ask the  question, what is Arcelor up to?

           We have  learned over the time that man in his own capacity is subject to environmental  changes and those changes have either positive or negative impact on him and  the environment in which he lives. If a negative  change occurs it causes destabilization of man's habitat and dilapidates his nature and understanding of  things in the surrounding. In so doing, there is a need to relate scientific  understanding to natural phenomena in our daily life. In other places around  the globe, science has provided vast  pieces of evidence on how the many contributions of scientific research  positively affect human nature and society as a whole. Science and technology  have had a major impact on society, and their impact is growing.

Inflation is high – youth unemployment is heightening –  purchasing power is low – the real wage  of civil servants is being highly impacted by inflation – poverty has rendered  our people hopeless.  In this 21st  century, Liberians are the 8th unhappiest group of people on planet  earth according to UNDP 2018 World Happiness Report.

           It is  never easy for any government to institute pro-poor policy; neither is it usual  or popular for an individual to do the right thing. That is why almost everybody  overstates his/her value, experience, worth, etc. A homebuyer overestimates his/her  monthly earnings to convince a bank that he/she can afford the mortgage  payment. A big business includes non-business money (for example, a loan from a  related party) to increase its revenue; searching for a loan, a government inflates its assets; it accepts anti-poor policy  dictated by money-lending institutions,  or it under-reports its unemployment rate.

           All over  the world, politicians seeking office make promises. This is presumably done  with the tacit conviction that such promises will bring about improvement in  the current status quo and alter voters’ beliefs about the policies the  politician will implement if elected as  well as the capabilities of the politician. However, as we have seen elsewhere  and in Liberia, promises can only be credible and worthy as long as reputation  has a value. Unfortunately, in a country like ours with high illiterate population,  staggering poverty level and minimal critical minds to objectively analyze and scrutinize,  politicians have learned to exploit these  missing links by using tribal affiliations, ‘cash violence’, patrimonial ties  and deception to ascend to political power.

           Then  come the nouveau riches donning gaudy costumes, acting like the new overlords  in the wasteland. Masquerading with high-sounding phrases in a spectacle of  empty braggadocio. Not aware of the fact that the leadership of the Homeland is  a poisoned chalice meant to expose their bankruptcy to the stubborn people who  have a bit of trust in them... They  are not new elites but Barbarians. They seem to be confused. Statecraft is not  their forte, but plunder and arrogance. The pandemic is lethal and fatal. They  seem lost in the wilderness. Their action is naïve. Their inaction is  scandalous. Their decisions are  kwashiorkor-ridden. Their conduct is appalling.

Bishop  Charles Clifton Penick was the third missionary bishop of Cape Palmas and Parts  Adjacent, Liberia from 1877 to 1883. He was a Virginia native and consecrated  at the Church of the Messiah, Baltimore, Maryland on February 13, 1877.

Truly speaking, a hundred days is an unfair  period to adjudge any emergent administrative regime failed or successful, not  even in jurisdictions that are more economically developed and stronger.  Certainly, it cannot also be done in the case of the Coalition for Democratic  Change regime that inherited a near-virgin state coffer from a 12-year  kleptocracy that struggled and failed to wrestle with galloping inflation and  massive corruption, which the leader herself described as a vampire

This accounts for a whopping 13.2 percent increment (US$2,850,095) even though  the government is still struggling to generate an uncollected revenue of US$332  million from the fiscal year 2017-2018. The nation remains aid-dependent and  loan-reliant while the Ministry of State for Presidential Affairs has budgeted  over US$21.5 million just in a period of 12 months.

When did Minister McGill get so interested in  securing a US$200,000 loan? Is it after becoming Minister for just 90-days? Is Hon. McGill a pro-poor Minister or a  pro-rich Minister?

The vulgar  minds suppose we are wishful thinkers, but beyond their noses and the  abstraction of common sense they understand not complicated processes and see  not the simmering contradictions, driven by a molecular  movement that lies beneath the surface. Such sterility precludes them from understanding that under certain conditions  everything changes into its opposite.

           The heralded prospect of Liberia rapidly expanding its economy  through industrialization; thus, urbanizing and increasing the number of  workers in the working class (employment) through the penetration of foreign  capital is a dream not to be realized now or in the distant future. The thing  is, almost every advanced capitalist country is experiencing the capitalist crisis  of over production/over capacity – which points to the epoch of senile decay of  a social system that was considered by many bourgeois economists like Francis  Fukuyama as an eternal system of organizing the productive forces of society.  The crisis of overproduction and its attending consequences is now making those  apologists of capitalism to eat their words in shame.

           Poverty  is endemic and multifaceted in all segments of Liberia (rural and urban). According  to UNDP (2015), the leading contributors to poverty incidence (54 percent) include the difficult living standard (51.4 percent), low level of education (25.6 percent) and limited access to health (23.0 percent). About half of the country’s 4.2 million people living below the poverty line of US$2 per day are unable to meet their basic food and  non-food needs (LISGIS-Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2014). Lack of  access to farming inputs, low credit facility and poor quality health and education remain the key drivers of poverty. Unstable macroeconomic climate also  fuels poverty, as  the recent commodity shocks heightened inflationary pressures via exchange rate pass-through effect.

           From a brief look at figures  in the draft budget, the Weah regime spends a colossal US$ 488 million on  recurrent expenditure, which means close to 87% of the draft budget is expected  to be spent on the government, leaving the ordinary people to suffocate in  despair. Meanwhile, payroll constitutes approximately 62% of it. A close look  at the figure contradicts the Weah government much-heralded  pronouncement about the reduction of salary, as the draft budget shows US$303.4million  sudden jump in compensation, which far exceeds the approximately US$ 280  million used for the said purpose under the  administration of his predecessor.

           Until the official framework of the current  administration’s well-sung “pro-poor governance policy” can come out of the  belly of ongoing retreats and PowerPoint deliberations, practical actions are  the only prism upon which the merits of the policy and the insincerity of its  proponents can be measured. Nothing is less than this. Not even the volume of  the expected Pro-Poor Strategy Paper or the ecstasy generated by its literary  renditions can substitute for deliberate practical revolutionary pronouncements  and follow-up actions from President George Manneh Weah and his administration.

           The  ‘Sultan’ of an illusionary Ottoman Empire—Turkey’s President Erdogan—is  pressuring submissive politicians throughout the Balkan countries to do his  bidding to restore the glory of the Ottoman period. For Erdogan, this is not  simply an unfulfilled quest; he has been targeting the Balkans for the past  several years (which he views as easy prey) to co-opt  into his sphere of influence by spreading his Islamic agenda under the guise of  cultural cooperation. He is investing heavily in infrastructure and religious  institutions, using businesses as leverage (while reaping economic benefit) as  part of his sinister scheme to consolidate Turkey’s grip on the Balkan states  to serve his neo-Ottoman design.

           Today, May 5, 2018, marks the 200th Birth Anniversary of Karl  Mark. Let us examine the  Work of Karl Marx and draw lessons from it that can be used to make living  conditions better for the Working People of the world. Here are  the  dismal living conditions of the Working People of the World:
           <br/>
           1. Half of the world's  population lives on less than USD2'50 a day.
           <br/>
           2. One-fourth of the  world's population lives on less than USD125 a day.
           <br/>
           3. 80% of the world's  population lives on less than USD10 a day'
           <br/>
           4. 80% of the world's  income and wealth is accounted for by 1% of the world's population
           <br/>
           5. The gap between the  poor and the rich within countries is widening and this gap between poor and  rich countries is also widening.

           Finance Minister Samuel D.  Tweah told a gathering of Diaspora Liberians in Philadelphia that the salaries of  civil servants should be sliced. It became a cause célèbre, triggering massive condemnation from  Liberians both on social media and in the local press. A unity in condemnation  this writer has not seen for a long time...Samuel D. Tweah was slammed  for being insensitive, and some virtually poured on him negative tags, calling  his conscience into question. The condemnation trended on social media and it  sparked a national outcry. Even the somewhat apolitical folks joined the deafening  refrain of slander, and the minister was reduced to a mere whipping boy. The  outrage was loud, and it confirmed the fact that the people act on the basis of  extreme necessity.

           Many people,  including Liberians, want to operate a business. Some people undertake the enterprise  for pleasure, while others carry it out to support their living. However, many  small and medium-size entrepreneurs always  avoid the prerequisites, to write a detailed plan, according to a chief  executive. He said public research shows that “…small business owners do not  put time and research into a business plan meant to keep them from making a fatal mistake.” Wrongly, they conclude that their enthusiasm and creativity are the  most important prerequisites; hence, they brush off advice to write a detailed  plan, he added.

           Recent decisions by the  Land Commission of the Republic of Liberia to provide Policy Recommendations  for land rights in Liberia, which centered on four basic areas: Public Land,  Government Land, Customary Land, and Private Land are laudable efforts.  However, to undertake Land Administration reform, especially in a country that  has seen and continued to see unpredictable consequences in land tenure and  land disputes, it is important to draw on best practices in Land Reform  Administration; certainly, it is important to consider and adopt factors that  affect the reform and the choice of the specific strategies adopted.

          Usually, in a democracy, the president or head of state of a  country has the right to appoint a cabinet to help administer the affairs of  the government. Mostly that right is inherent in the constitution of the state.  While the Senate can confirm or reject a cabinet nomination and serve as check  and balance, the president also has the right to dismiss a cabinet member at  will. Does public opinion matter in the exercise of that right? The answer can  be either yes or no... This article analyses the cabinet appointments of Liberian  President George Weah. The article looks at the personalities of the  appointees, their qualifications, and whether or not the officials can  implement Weah’s "Pro Poor Agenda". The paper also examines public  opinion regarding the appointments. The personality analysis is an attempt to  determine the fitness of political actors to their appointed posts. It can  predict their behaviors in public administration.

          Recent  public notices from the Government of President George M Weah through airport  authorities that trespassers and suspected looters caught at the secured  parameters of the airport will be “shot on sight” is a grim reminder of our  despotic and evil past, many Liberians prefer never to relive again... As  we approach another anniversary of the Military Coup of April 12, 1980, the  spectacle of several Liberians shot, execution style in the Executive Mansion  and around the Capitol City of Monrovia and 13 very prominent Officials of  Government lined up and publically executed on a Monrovia beach, looms large in  our minds with fears of history being repeated.

          ‘Better Late than Never’: The Execution of Michael Doe is a story  that has been in the making since 2005; all we needed to find if there were  additional eyewitnesses to validate the execution-style killing of our  relative, Michael J. Doe by General Prince Yormie Johnson at Hotel Africa. The phrase “better late than never” is an early English proverb  that was first recorded in 1200; it means it is better to do something when it  is supposed to be done than not to do it at all.

Against this reality, an all-out war has been declared by the  ruling clique, in alliance with its intellectual prostitutes and street thugs, against  progressive media institutions and elements that report the facts and interrupt  information to the Liberian people about the wholesale mismanagement of the  state.

          Whenever Kosovo is mentioned we are reminded of the 90s, when  Europe and the US provided shelter for hundreds of thousands of Albanians who  resisted the tyrannical Milosevic regime. A few years later in 1999, the US,  jointly with EU countries, launched NATO air strikes against the Serbs’  artillery position to end their atrocities. With the support of Western  countries, Kosovo became the newest state in Europe, and this year it  celebrates its 10th anniversary as an independent country.

          In life, as in history, it has been proven that there can be  no objectivity in the rendering of historical verdicts. Historians analyze historical  accounts based on their own class interest. For example, American bourgeois  historians will never heroically record the role of Brother George Lester Jackson  of the Soledad Brothers, for challenging the racist American justice system. In  their historical accounts, through self-censorship, they have presented him as  a radical black extremist who was jailed for theft and subsequently killed in  1971 when he tried escaping from prison.

          The  question is not only how and why the Governors violated the laws, but why former  President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  Liberia’s economic adviser, looked the other way. In fact, the IMF added, in  its November 13, 2017, IMF Report that, “Good  progress has been made in fiscal reforms,” meaning Liberian bureaucrats were prudent  managers. Well, this old adage that says, “Rules are meant to be broken” might help you understand why the former  President and, or the IMF did not take seriously the violations. However, unlike the  inexperienced rule breaker, “...the master rule-breaker breaks the rules... to get  something done…” good or bad, according to Mr. Dustin Wax.

          Has done all it can to ensure our natural  resources are optimized for the betterment of all its citizens? Have we properly leveraged our natural and human capital for development and  continued sustainability? Have current policies been designed to ensure macroeconomic and fiscal stability? There is no  exact formula for technical aspects of policy design, however there are best  practices that have been proven to work repeatedly; different countries may employ  the extraction of their natural resources with endowments and with  characteristics that suit that specific country, but a few things must happen  for any country to experience wealth in an equitable and sustainable way. The  question now remains: How does Liberia leverage its natural resources to create  a political economy with strong institutions that ensure socio-economic  development and a system that guarantees a fair  degree of equability across the board?

          One of the much-heralded  acts of justice injected into the renegotiated concession agreements of Mittal  Steel Liberia and Firestone Liberia was the replacement of discretionary  pricing by the concessionaires with “prevailing global/international market  prices” for our natural resources.  This  provision is supposed to correct the ills of transfer pricing and give Liberia  a fair price for the natural resources being exported from Liberia.  Following that revision, all other  concessions negotiated stipulate “prevailing global/international market  prices” for our resources.  This is  considered best practice and deemed fair  for both the concessionaires and the host country.

          I find that conditions in Liberia no longer  warrant a further extension of DED, but that the foreign policy interests  of the United States warrant affording an orderly transition (“wind-down”)  period to Liberian DED beneficiaries.  In consultation with my advisors, I  have concluded that a 12‑month wind‑down period is appropriate in order to  provide Liberia’s government with time to reintegrate its returning citizens  and to allow DED beneficiaries who are not eligible for other forms of  immigration relief to make necessary arrangements and to depart the  United States.

          Do these actions and, or inactions support the excessive  benefits? I don’t think so. However, President Weah can use the issue of  nonperformance to roll back these kinds of excessive payments. This  recommendation, which is in line with President George Weah’s pledge to reduce  his salary by twenty-five percent, is necessary if Liberia wants to end the practice  of the money culture before it becomes a way of life. An unknown Chinese  commented on attitude, according to Robert C. Johnson. The unknown Chinese  stated: “…Be careful of your habits, for your habits become  your character. Be careful of your character, for your character becomes your  destiny.”

According to the agency of  government that manages the fiscal affairs of the state, the recast of the  budget was necessitated by realistically aligning expenditure with revenue. According  to the Ministry’s Proposal for the Recast of 2017/2018 National Budget, “The  National Legislature approved a budget of US$563.5m for FY2017/18 to facilitate  Government’s operations and undertake needed public sector investments.

          As it is often said, when the struggles for the belle intensify,  even the integrities of men are swept under the carpet. Nowadays, the huge  appetite for material wealth coupled with the unflinching desire for  uncontrollable alcohol and womanizing have plunged some young brothers into acts  deemed unholy to the socio-sacred religion of public service. Our fellow  compatriots are primarily concern over wealth they can illegally accrue rather  than honestly and professionally discharging the duties and responsibilities of  the trust the people repose in them.

          Yes, I visited my hometown, Fessibu,  Zorzor District, Lofa County, after spending many years away from Liberia. Coincidentally,  the visit was after Liberians had elected President George Weah and rejected  former Vice-President Joseph Boakai, a son of Foya District, Lofa County.  Before I departed from Monrovia to Lofa, many of my relatives and friends had  jokingly stated that I was going to have fun and see many changes as war-weary  residents strive to rebuild.

          The recent violation  of Israel’s airspace by an Iranian drone  and Israel’s retaliation against Syrian and Iranian targets prompted many  observers to suggest that the growing regional tension resulting from such  incidents may precipitate a war between Israel and Iran/Hezbollah, and perhaps  inadvertently with Syria as well. I disagree with this prognosis. I maintain that  none of the players involved want to engage in a war that will inflict  tremendous destruction and casualties without realizing any sustainable  long-term gains. This, however, does not preclude an accidental war resulting  from an unintended incident or miscalculation.

          In an epoch of global competitiveness when progressive  societies are tapping on the expertise of the savvy and brightest to lead the  task for transformation, Cape Mount has been cursed with a degenerate  leadership which will kill every vitality left in the county. Our county has  been plagued with a leadership which is lacking in every iota of competence and  consciousness to lead the charge for a progressive future in which the county  will situate itself at the apex of indices of national comparison of social  indicators. This Reverse gear which has been activated will increase poverty  levels, widen inequality, worsen the standard of living, and increase the death  toll of the citizens by curable diseases.

In line with global  custom, good governance and contemporary politics which are hinged to public  accountability, transparency, and  openness, whenever a new government takes over, it is under obligation to  develop and share a realistic short-term vision and/or immediate plan with its  citizens, development partners and  donors.

         The advent of the Coalition for Democratic Change government  responds to longtime popular outcry, chronic loath for the old order and a  widespread hate for people and things associated with it. Like the April 12,  1980 volcano that uprooted the decadent settler hegemony, or like the December  29, 1989 popular people’s uprising which unfortunately turned into an inferno,  the December 26, 2017 victory was an intrinsic people’s revolution justified by  the huge divide between the impoverished majority, the governed or the  have-nots, and the minority elites,

         Though  Liberia has produced and exported high-grade iron ore in huge quantity since  1951, it is still importing steel nail and steel rod. Iron ore in the Liberian  economy accounted for nearly 30% of total export earnings in 2016, but what  difference has this percentage made on the livelihood of the people?

         Against  all standards of merit but in conformity with the afterthought of so-called “struggle  heroes and heroines being rewarded with lucrative jobs,” President George M. Weah,  in his quest to place mediocrity at the height of the public sector, appointed  Jefferson Koijee to the coveted position of mayor of the metropolitan city of  Monrovia... Amidst  mounting criticisms from the enlightened voices in the Republic about said misnomer, forces of reaction within the ranks  of the reactionary and revisionist Coalition for Democratic Change (CD),  bombarded social media with a defeatist, anthology of mumbo-jumbo, and labeled  decent patriots of the homeland as “envious, hateful, pessimistic individuals” without  discarding the core of our argument.

         Amongst the  many recommendations forwarded to our President, Mr. George Manneh Weah, I have  yet to see any proposal as to how best Liberia can generate the necessary revenue  to finance the needed programs. Currently, Liberia’s reliance on users’ tax  (i.e., such as import tax, which constitutes  50% of government revenue) is inadequate to fund the current budgetary  allotment, not to mention additional programs.

He couldn't have proposed anything contrary when his  government reflects in its truest sense the capturing of power by a wretched  masses of people from their long-time  oppressors, hence possessing a popular  character.

         Mr. Paul Wolfowitz, former  President of the World Bank, might be grunting if he thought that his hard work  would help President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to succeed in Liberia, making this success the  first success story of the World Bank. Mr. Wolfowitz visited Liberia on several  missions when the country was without  electricity; he helped in encouraging creditors to cancel Liberia’s US $4.5  billion debt; won over reluctant financial donors towards Liberia, and he provided promotional praises for President  Sirleaf. But, instead of a success story, Mr. Wolfowitz might learn that many  Liberians think that the World Bank is not a philanthropic institution created  to fight poverty.

         Liberia should be spearheading the inclusion of women in  governance and politics. Liberia gave birth to two Nobel Peace Laureates,  activists Leymah Gbowee and President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. The election of  Liberia’s first female Vice President came immediately at the end of the  African continent’s first female president’s tenure... However according to the

         The following is a  satirical would-be conversation between Prime Minister Netanyahu (Bibi) and  President Trump (Donald) during Netanyahu’s upcoming visit to the White House  on March 5th... [White House,  exterior. BIBI exits his motorcade, waving to the few dignitaries that were  invited for the occasion.]... BIBI: (to himself)  Will this be my last visit to the White House? (a pause) Oh well, I have  weathered many storms before, I will still outfox everybody else, God willing.

         It may now seem almost a century  since December  26, 2017, but still in  our subconsciousness George Manneh Weah was set out not to be the normal,  seasoned politician or intellect that we anxiously  wanted to maintain the status quo. But then soon after January 22,  2018,  we quickly wept away our tears and  accepted the fact that Liberia, indeed,   now has a very normal and highly innovative presidency of its time. With  only two major speeches to his credit thus far, the new President has shown  himself to be a master tactician – he is where nobody expects him.

         The policy experts involved in  the writing of Liberia’s Petroleum law (2002) perhaps overlooked important  aspects of the petroleum sector, including “Critical Safeguard, Oil Spill, and Environmental Sustainability”. The omission  of “safeguard in alignment with Safety, Health and Environment” as was proposed  by the Petroleum Law makes said document inadequate. “Safeguard”, which is a  cardinal initiative to mitigate risks to person, environment, and facility,  cannot be overlooked in the development of essential laws regulating the  petroleum industry.

         Subtle  whining is being echoed by the people in certain quarters of Monrovia in  regards to the lip service of the “pro-poor” leadership to deliver public goods  and limit public bad. Just in less than two months contradictions are rearing  their ugly heads in a somewhat unorthodox way, exposing the change mantra as a  façade. It is so surprising to some that the new leadership has speedily degenerated  in less than two months, in a way which has further exposed the political farce.

         Human Rights Watch wishes to congratulate you  on winning Liberia’s recent election. As you take up your new position and  consider your priorities for Liberia, we write today to urge you to put  justice, accountability and strengthening  rule of law institutions at the very top of your agenda. Specifically, we  encourage you to revisit the issue of justice for past crimes committed during  Liberia’s civil wars, notably by invigorating plans for trials of civil wars-era crimes in order to bring justice to  the victims, punish the perpetrators, and strengthen respect for the rule of  law.

         President George  Manneh Weah is wrong to refer to himself as the 24th President of  the Republic of Liberia. In many of his public utterances, including his widely  watched inaugural speech at the Samuel Kanyon Doe sports complex President  George Manneh referred to himself as the 24th President of the  Republic of Liberia. Exactly one week following his inaugural speech, President  George Weah propounded the same narrative in his State of the Nation address…  he stated: “I, George Manneh Weah, your humble servant, took the oath of office  and was sworn in as the 24th President of the Republic of Liberia”.  Interestingly, some members of his inner circle are also peddling this false  narrative, much to the bewilderment of historians.

This horrific mass murder of  young and old attests to the criminal negligence of our lawmakers and  president, who dispense with their responsibility by offering to the bereaved  families hollow condolences and fake prayers.

         Liberia is lagging behind countries that gained their independence over 100 years after Liberia gained its independence. This is because our leaders do not pay attention to educatuion nor have  agenda that will benefit the country in the long-run. The campus of the  University of Liberia which appeared to be a friendly zone for President George Manneh Weah during the  presidential election, became unsympathetic and rancorous with the burning of  tires, chanting battle cries and waving banners expressing their disenchantment  with Dr. Ophelia Weeks, President of the University of Liberia and demanding  her resignation. We witnessed similar demonstration or go-slow a few months ago at the Tubman University, another public institution of higher learning against the administration of the current president, Dr. Edward Wonkeryor.

         A corruption-free government could turn Liberia  into a modern paradise and an enviable nation of prosperity and equality for  all. It is time for all citizens to share in Liberia’s wealth regardless of  creed, class, ethnicity and political affiliation. As a youth activist, I have  vehemently stood up against a corrupt and nepotistic system for 12 years, and my  passion for a NEW LIBERIA remains unquenched. I am hopeful that this NEW  LIBERIA can be achieved under President Weah if only he can appoint and  commission a strong anti-graft TEAM.

         Amongst the  many recommendations forwarded to our President, Mr. George Manneh Weah, I have  yet to see any proposal as to how best Liberia can generate the necessary revenue  to finance the needed programs. Currently, Liberia’s reliance on users’ tax  (i.e., such as import tax, which constitutes  50% of government revenue) is inadequate to fund the current budgetary  allotment, not to mention additional programs.

One is leaving the presidency with the greatest  popularity in the international community as well as a great number of loyalists  and power brokers at home. The other could be on the verge to seize the reins  of the nation.

         The geopolitical  developments in the Middle East over the past fifteen years have created new  political and security dynamics engendered by the violent turmoil and profound  concerns over the Iranian threat, shared by Israel and the Arab states. Israel  is now facing a new critical juncture: continue with its oppressive occupation  and creeping annexation of Palestinian land, which stands in total contrast to  its moral responsibility and Jewish values; or seek a peace agreement with the  Palestinians in the context of an Arab-Israeli comprehensive peace, which the  Arab states seek now more than any time before because of their domestic and  foreign security concerns.

         The attention of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC)  has been drawn to widespread reports  on social and other media  referencing a So-called  “Black List” or “Rest List”  from the CDC. The incoming ruling party wishes to categorically  deny,  refute and disassociates  itself from  the  existence of any List targeting any group of Liberians for discrimination in  any  form or manner.

         Is the  debt of the Liberian government (i.e., Parent) to the Central Bank of Liberia  (i.e., Subsidiary) authentic, legitimate and transparent debt? If yes, should  it be excluded from the Current Assets of the Bank in determining the Bank’s  liquidity since the Accounts Receivable is not redeemable within one year? I  gave an answer to the latter question at the Governance Commission Seminar held  on 12/15/17, and also stated that the Central Bank owes US $42,000 million.

         As the mid-term political campaigns begin, perhaps we should  pause and think where this country is headed under the leadership of Trump,  with the House and Senate in control of the Republican party - a party that has  lost its soul and its way, failing to safeguard America’s national interest.  This is a party that strives to cling to power - which is not itself unusual - but  seeks it at all costs with no scruples and no moral compass. It seems that the  Republican establishment will do whatever it takes to promote their narrow  conservative agenda, which caters to the rich and powerful, while supporting a  president who has nothing to offer the country but disgrace.

         The  demand for the US dollar has contributed to the decline of the value of the  Liberian dollar since 2006. It declined from LD 62 to US $1 dollar in 2006, to  LD 108 to US $1 in 2016, and in 2018, it is LD 126 for US $1. The exchange rate  decline is now being exacerbated by the liquidity crisis. Nowadays, due to the  shortage of cash, commercial banks are reluctant to cash government checks or  provide credit lines to government contractors, according to the President of  the Liberian Banking Association when he served as a panelist at the Governance  Commission Seminar on 12/15/17.

I had an opportunity to have met Sonnie on  January 12, 2017 and I became appalled by her worsening condition especially  after being abandoned by those who inflicted such casualty on her. Sonnie, a vendor of sandwich bread, said to me in  a pathetic tone when I first met her “I have no one to fight my case. They  really hurt me for no reason. I am going blind and they are doing nothing about  it.” Momentarily,

         Liberia's post-conflict  democratic governance period left the people of Liberia deprived, desperate and  destitute. Liberians believe that the vast resources of the country were  squandered, plundered, and pillaged. As a result,  they rose-up during the election to hold Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the Unity Party  accountable, and overwhelmingly elected George Weah, president and Jewel  Howard- Taylor, vice president. The Liberian people frantically wanted  change at any cost due to their bitterness, anger  and disappointment.

         From his pen at the  center of the Roman-African Church, St Augustine of Tunisia/Hippo, asked, “When  justice is taken away, what are kingdoms but a vast banditry?” These words by  an African Catholic Bishop even flowed through subsequent centuries to become  the basic pillar in the thought of the Protestant Reformer, Jean Calvin. St  Augustine’s concern during the formative stages of the Church has become the  same concern that some well-meaning international agencies and some Liberians  have.

         On December 26, 2017, the change the Liberian people  desired was given to them through the decisive victory of the Congress for  Democratic Change (CDC), headed by Senator George Manneh Weah. Now, what is  required is the smooth and peaceful transfer of power in ALL democracies,  especially, the Liberian Democracy. Why should this one be any different? Why  turn a simple peaceful transfer of power into something so complex which  involves the outgoing president and the incoming president to form a committee  in which two of them serve as co-chairs? When I last checked, this process,  which requires an Executive Order 91 to transfer power is first of its kind in  70 years.

One of the fundamental admirations  for democracy is sustaining our democratic institution so that it will enhance  the well-being of its people. Liberia is far bigger than all our tribal, individual and political  differences. Putting Liberia's interests first must not be a challenge to us as  one nation, and we must be able to tolerate both negative and positive  arguments in negotiating those differences that have caused us to be divided.

Dr. Tipoteh made his Statement on  the Way Forward over the weekend after reflecting on the increasingly numerous  expressions of concerns about Elections 2017. At the outset of his  Statement, Dr. Tipoteh reminds us about his decision to step out of the  Presidential Race because the 2017 Elections would not be fair. He said that  the Election would not be fair because the National Elections Commission (NEC)  did not have a credible Voter Registration Roll, without which it is  universally considered that it is impossible to have any fair election.

Initially, I thought Israelis would pour out  into the streets celebrating this ‘historic’ moment, but other than small  chatter here and there, and some expressions of jubilation, not much else  gripped the nation. On the Palestinian side, relatively small demonstrations  broke out in the West Bank and Gaza, which continued in the following days with  limited violence, and condemnation of the US declaration was heard from most  Arab and Muslim capitals. This is pretty much where things stand today.

         Liberians, rightly so, are  reacting to the comment made by Ms. Christine Elder, the U.S. Ambassador to  Liberia. Ms. Elder had asked political leaders to abandon the legal proceedings  of electoral irregularities of the October 10, 2017 presidential elections and  move on to the run-off. Liberia should move on to the run-off since  international observers did not report any significant irregularities that  would impact the results of the 10/10/2017 elections, and that the main  complainant got only 9% of the total votes, she added.

         Liberians  are known for saying, “I was born here and will die here”; “The love of Liberty  brought us here”; some are even saying “The love of Liberty met us here”. All  these assertions speak to the membership of individuals to the modern  democratic state or what is referred to as ‘citizenship’. Irrespective of  social, ethnic and political backgrounds, all Liberians citizens possess and  deserve a wide range of civic, political and economic rights as Liberian. But  there are increasing number of Liberian citizens who do not enjoy these rights  hence do not feel a sense of belonging to the Liberian State.

         My  take is that the Supreme Court of Liberia may have to ask the NEC: why did it  refuse to turn over public records from the October 10 elections in  its (NEC) possession to justify how it (NEC) apportioned votes for the  candidates? The Court may not even rule on rerun or runoff election. The Court most likely  will order the NEC to turn over ALL records from the October  10 elections asked for by LP/UP. Legal scholars refer to the LP/UP appeal to the Supreme Court as either a  "Mandamus"...

         Transition  is the active vocabulary of Liberians in the politically cycle, as a result,  the word has become a threadbare cliché due to overuse and sometimes deliberate  misuse. It is almost eight decades since our country made such democratic  milestone. Whether it will happen in this year is something to be seen, as the  outcome of the process has been contested, thus leaving many to wonder whether  the legal process will conclude in time for the runoff to be held.

         Karl Marx was  right when he postulated that it is not the consciousness of men that determines  their existence, but on the contrary men’s social existence is that which  determines their consciousness. He further taught us that the existence of a  social reality which will lead to man’s progressive consciousness (a  consciousness that enables men to develop art, science, culture, religion or  philosophy) is dependent on how the socioeconomic system of a society develops  its productive forces and organizes its means of production.

         Indications are rife that  a George Weah ‘s ascendency to the summit of state will be a colossal nightmare  and catastrophic faux pas, as he is a conspicuous contradiction to everything  leadership represents in this current approach of globalization. The CDC  project will stagnate us in the cesspool of political sclerosis and the  cul-de-sac of economic profligacy gleamed on the world like the mene tekel  upharsin of Belshazzar. Whether the colonized  acolytes of the Coalition for Desperate Crooks like it or not, on the one hand  the shibboleth of change is perfunctory, on the other hand; it is a jingo that  is only in the periphery, falling short of addressing the structural imbalances  in the state.

         Perhaps, the  long-term endgame for LP/UP---and now this recent ruling by the Supreme  Court--is to drag out the legal proceedings so that the runoff or rerun  elections take place long after President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf leaves office  on January 18, 2018. We are happy with the recent Court's ruling and let the NEC keep dragging its  feet by prolonging the hearings and refusing to turn over to UP/LP pertinent  documents that would validate their claims of fraud and vote-rigging.

         What  a gross disrespect to us! If the U.S. had cared that much, then the United States would not have  tolerated the 12 years of corruptions with impunity under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,  her family, friends and corrupt elite. Thanks for your advice that is, perhaps, propelled by the lobying efforts of Riva Livingstone (President Sirleaf's lobyist who is currently in Liberia):; but we do not need  it! That’s our message to you, Ambassador Elder! There  is a saying in Liberia called: “Hurry, hurry burst trousers”; and that “Patient  dog eats the fattest bone”. These are parables our parents and old folks taught  us when growing up in Liberia. The Almighty God too, used similar advice to the  people of Israel when they were impatient to reach the Promised Land.

         to the development (January 26, 2015). These two  descriptions were coined by Her Excellency Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf the  President of Liberia and the 2011 Nobel Prize Laureate. The former one was when  she was swearing into office in 2006, while the latter was when she was  delivering her annual message to the Joint Session of the Legislature, 2015. Besides, these two negative metaphors clearly indicate dangerousness and  harmfulness of the corruption to the national development especially within the  context of Liberia. Moreover, this article goes further to conceptualize  corruption as a cancer that eats up sound and constructive policies,  agenda and transformative goals for the nation.

         The unspeakable  atrocities that are happening in South Sudan are unfathomable, not only because  of the scope of savagery in the war between the Dinka and Nuer peoples, but  also because it defies every tenet of our civilized being in which we take so  much pride. Civilization, however, has hardly penetrated the first layer of our  thick skin. We assume that our unprecedented advancements in technology,  medicine, space exploration, engineering, literature, and all forms of arts  have equally deepened our moral and ethical conviction. No. We have in fact  become increasingly immune and unmoved by the savagery which is unfolding  before our eyes in so many countries.

         January 2018 is fast waning.  The sun is sliding behind winter’s gray shroud: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will hand  over the baton of leadership to her successor. This peaceful transition, if  uninterrupted or not halted by ongoing political intricacies regarding the October poll, which some say was marred by  fraud and gross irregularities, maybe the first experienced in over seven  decades. Johnson Sirleaf... leaves  behind a trail of records that are both rapturously commendable and heavily  detestable. A more corrupt, poor and hungry nation with abundant resources and vast  inequalities.

         Liberia is in the Guinness Book of World Records for conducting the most  fraudulent and rigged elections in modern recorded human history, and the 2017  elections could be a repeat of that history.In the 1927 presidential elections pitting Charles DB King against one Mr. JR  Faulkner, there were 15,000 registered voters of Americo-Liberian stock only as  natives who constituted 95 percent of the population were denied the right to  vote until around 1960, even when natives were, again denied their right to form  opposition political parties. So in 1927, Mr. King, the government said, got 234,000 votes out of the 15,000  registered voters.

         Among  my many predictions here, I said that Senator George Manneh Weah could create  the “macron effect” – that 39-years old young man – Emmanuel Macron – who  turned the tables on the French political Establishment to become the elected  president of France last may. Well, from our current orchestrated political  stalemate, it has been firmly installed in the minds of the majority population  (including even the staunchest supporters of VP Boakai) that the popular  Senator has already won the election – and come what may.

           Liberian Lawyer Blasts ECOWAS and  Gets it Wrong: The Case of Pearl Bull

         ECOWAS and AU leaders were not in Liberia to “interfere in the  judicial system of Liberia”, but to ease tensions and curb potential future  crises. There is a good reason why this is a reasonable and necessary position  for these stakeholders to take: The last time Liberia went into the  self-destruct mode, the crises spilt over into neighboring countries. It cost  our neighbors tens of millions of dollars to contain our escalating war, and it  even cost them the lives of a number of their soldiers who were on  peace-keeping missions. Most importantly, displaced Liberians became refugees  in these neighboring countries at a tremendous cost to the hosts; some  Liberians still remain abroad as refugees.

         There are those who find complete satisfaction in what they  know and how they expect things to be in line with what they know.  These are the ones who, in their stagnancy of  thought,  miss out on the richness of  going beyond the horrizon, not acknowledging that knowledge,  as life, is is a never ending journey of  exploration and discovery.

         It  is unfortunate that Liberians in the Diaspora cannot vote for leaders of their  beloved country. This is unfortunate especially when one notes that, during the  last few decades, Liberia experienced the most turbulent periods of its  existence—a military coupe and subsequent military rule, a brutal civil war, and  a devastating Ebola pandemic. With these horrific experiences, it is important,  indeed uncompromisingly compelling, that the future of Liberia be entrusted in capable  hands; otherwise, the nation will be plunged backward for decades, if not  another century. Thus, it would have helped for Liberians in the Diaspora to  vote for their leaders. Since this is not the case, I hereby declare that, if I  could vote, I would vote VP Boakai.

         George Weah must have been a  great leader on the field to win those prestigious awards, such as “African  Footballer of the Year, European Footballer of the Year and FIFA Footballer of  the Year”. The competition is high at that level that one must be extraordinary  to compete and win handedly like that; we must all agree... But to  simply transfer those accolades of leadership from one arena to another is  incomprehensible and unacceptable. The skill sets that are necessary to propel  one in sports leadership are not the same required for governmental leadership;  they are two different playing fields. Yes, there may be some overlapping  qualities, yet a clear distinction is required. It is necessary for a candidate  to clearly articulate how he intends to use one set of skills from one  leadership role to another. That is what has been lacking with the Weah campaign.  When an opportunity presented itself for Mr. Weah to convince the rest of us  why his acquired leadership skills in the sporting arena would be justifiably  and successfully transferable to the government leadership arena

         When we refuse to build a nation of leaders with  vision and integrity, we have no choice but to accept a generation of  liabilities. When I saw what youth in Ghana and Kenya are doing in terms of  pursuing productive ventures while I was there about a week ago, I was  overwhelmed with fear and uneasiness for youth in Liberia. The future of Liberia is uncertain. Our nation is  trekking on a journey to nowhere. Unfortunately, nothing genuine is being done  to find concrete solution to this predictable and perilous end. We could  encounter severe consequences and painfully pay for our silence if we continue  to ignore prevailing realities.

The poor will be poorer, dilapidated towns will continue to crumble, and crime  will rise; but worst of all, our underprivileged children will be weaker,  suffering from a lack of medical care and malnutrition with little or no  prospect for better and brighter tomorrows.

         In my thinking thoughts I  reflected the trend of events in the current 2017 Presidential and  Representative elections, and the obscurity and cacophony wrought in the perspectives  and minds of both laymen and pundits in various circles. So far in spite of the  accolades for managing a ‘peaceful process’, there is a diluting litany of  accusations, claims and counter-claims leaving the layman to wonder if we have  a play-play elections commission, play-play elections process, or will produce a  play-play new government. Either one or all could be true considering the  issues of the recent process and how the November 7 process could unfold  leading to an unanticipated inauguration on January 16, 2018.

         George  Mannah Weah is a soccer superstar, who is admired by Liberian youthful  Liberians. He made millions of dollars as a compensation for playing football.  Over the years, since his retirement and without utilizing any of the available  vehicles of investment and revenue generating activities, he has become  cashless, a broke man. He has suffered from the celebrity curse, which has  afflicted many NBA stars in America. They played basketball and made millions  of dollars only to mismanage the funds, leaving them to live in poverty.

         The razzmatazz is in  full swing and the politicians are undercutting each other in the last bid to  decide the winner of the election, as the presidential election goes for a  runoff between the ruling Unity Party and the Coalition for Democratic Change.  The two sides obtained the most votes in the first round of the polls, but  neither side bagged the fifty percent plus one threshold of absolute majority  to attain a win. Adherents of each side are purveying that their side will win,  which has engendered a convoluted whoop-de-doo on social media as  well as in the print and electronic media.

         Byron Tarr’s older brother Phillip Tarr and I graduated Bassa  High School together in 1960. Somehow our paths diverged and the younger Byron  entered my orbit in the late 60s. As Byron and I received our terminal degrees  in the United States in 1972 we began long and intense conversations about  Liberia’s past, its present and future prospects. A bond was established then  and it remained firm through the vicissitudes of Liberian national life since  then, broken only with his passing earlier this month. Funeral Services were  held at his home village of Zondo, No, 4 District, Grand Bassa County where his  remains were interred on Saturday, October 21, 2017.

         [Weah's]  record as a senior legislator has been indifferent at best, if not downright mediocre. He is inarticulate to the point of incoherence and boycotted the two presidential debates before the October vote for that reason. He has a very short attention span in meetings with diplomats and officials, including his party's executive, and is impatient with written briefs. Weah long ago depleted his fortune but his campaign was well funded: he flew from town to town in a chartered helicopter from
         <strong>

         Unity  Party is in a free fall due to the factional battles within its ranks. With  such fast degeneracy, the lack of coherence in its central command, porosity of  strategy due to massive leak, coupled with the no money syndrome, a George Weah  presidency engineered by the witch plutocrat Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is on the  horizon.

Portraying himself as an accomplished man he goes on to draw my late wife into  his line of fire with bogus claims of my not owning a house in Monrovia or  anywhere else and by his yardstick I am "useless".

         </strong>
         Based on results  from the National Elections Commission of Liberia, with 95.6% of precincts  reporting, it is mathematically clear that the Congress for Democratic Change and the Unity Party will meet in the second round  in November.  This is so because in the first round, no candidate threw the knockout blow.. As one observer puts it,  even votes from the great beyond will not help Cllr. Brumskine, Cummings, Urey, PYJ, etc.  to make it to the second round.

Over the years, since his retirement and without utilizing any of the available  vehicles of investment and revenue generating activities, he has become  cashless, a broke man. He has suffered from the celebrity curse, which has  afflicted many NBA stars in America. They played basketball and made millions  of dollars only to mismanage the funds, leaving them to live in poverty.

So, it does not make sense for The Perspective to be complacent when it becomes obvious that those who administered those war crimes against our people are now controlling and manipulating the ensuing elections”. Well, imagine our disquiet yesterday when unsubstantiated reports reached us from some sources in Monrovia that a plot for NEC to announce the results in favor of CDC is being set in motion, as we go to press, by some propelling invisible hands

But the  question is: how are these in any way reflected in the development of a country  so rich in natural resources, yet underdeveloped and impoverished?

Unlike most  news organs, ours had never endorsed a political party or any standard bearer,  but we view this watershed moment as a public service in helping voters make  informed decisions with the aforementioned collective aspirations in mind. Post  – war Liberia was already a fractured nation, so when one adds growing class,  ethnic, and partisan schisms, there is no doubt that the people deserve a  unifier like Joseph N. Boakai (JNB); someone who is unassuming, endearing, mature, responsive,  decisive, honest, and wise, attributes necessary in guiding consensus to  lead the nation towards unity and progress. And those are the leadership  qualities we saw in JNB which make us convinced he should be at the  helm to bridge a divided nation.

         On October 10th, Liberians of all walks of life and  political persuasions will set out to elect the next president of Africa's  oldest republic. Liberians  of all ethnicity, regions, religions, social status and generations will join  together to elect the next president of the country. The elections will bring  Liberians face-to-face will building and transforming the country into a vast  workshop the offers massive employment opportunities to our youth and create  wealth and opportunities that will be shared and redistributed equally amongst  all Liberians. The result of the elections will  test the maturity of our democracy after 12 contentious years of Ellen Johnson  Sirleaf, Liberia, and Africa’s first female president, and 14 years since the  end of the brutal civil war.

         Joseph Nyumah Boakai will win the presidential election for  two fundamental reasons--honesty and humility. These essential elements of good  leadership are very scant in Liberia. Governmental authorities have been  characterized by bigotry and arrogance since the founding of Liberia in 1822.  It is in this direction that the unassuming nature of Joseph Nyumah Boakai can  be clearly distinguished from most of the competitors for Liberia’s Presidency. The birth place of this patriot is the remote village of  Worsonga, Lofa County. He struggled to the top by simply being an honest man. Uncle  Joe, as he is popularly called, has held several positions in government and  the private sector where he exhibited respect for everyone regardless of social  status. Both his superiors and subordinates look up to him for guidance on  critical issues even though he always insists on being in the back.

         To hear an audio  version of this article, click here. The concern that Iran will pursue the  development of nuclear weapons once the current Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action (JCPOA) deal expires in ten years is legitimate. But addressing these  concerns cannot be achieved by nullifying the current agreement, which would  only strengthen Iran’s resolve to acquire nuclear weapons. Instead, the US and  its allies (along with Russia and China) should build on the existing deal so  that once it expires, Iran would not simply rush to acquire nuclear weapons but  weigh the benefits of not pursuing nuclear weapons against any strategic  advantage it could potentially reap by acquiring such an arsenal.

         Buried, and barely  covered, thanks to a bombastic Trump UNGA Address, is President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s  Farewell Address to the United Nations... In brief,  the President revisited what Liberia faced following the civil war, a  monumental task, that in all fairness, she embraced totally as her own.  President Sirleaf’s efforts in bringing Liberia back on the map are stupendous,  herculean, deservingly earning her the unenviable distinction, “Iron Lady”.  It is only sad that all the efforts during the  twelve years were undermined by bribery and corruption, which ironically, she  had declared “Public Enemy No1” on the first day of her administration.  There is a very bright side, however.

         Does President Sirleaf intend to  cheat in the October 10, 2017 elections? If not, then just what did she hope to  achieve from the visit to her home on Sunday, September 17, 2017, of the Deputy  Special Representative of UN Secretary-General, Yacoub El Hillo, NEC  Commissioners, Sam Joe, Boakai Dukuly, Sarah Toe, Chairman Jerome Korkoya,  Executive Director, Lamin Lighe and all nineteen Elections Magistrates,  for discussion on elections matters with just  about two weeks left to  elections. This  development has raised questions about the integrity and independence of the  NEC and heightened public suspicions about what former Grand Kru Senator Blamo  Nelson has described as President Sirleaf’s intention to cheat in these  elections.

         In the midst of the current 2017 elections season, I have  read many flippant remarks about the imminent peaceful transfer of presidential  power as
         <strong>
          a first
         </strong>
         in Liberian  history. No doubt the memory of the bulk of the present “youth bulge”  generation is conveniently limited to the recent past. But then I read an  interview by the celebrated author Helene Cooper that went like this: Interviewer: “Sirleaf is stepping down this year. How does  it feel to see her presidency ending?”

         The title of this review may sound messianic in a way, and  it is meant to be so. The book about Joseph Nyuma Boakai is written like a  story out of the Book. The story of Nyuma is like the story of Joseph, a name  the subject will pick up some time in his life, as he transited from one village  to another, from one town to another, in search of a stable home. Like Joseph  in the Book, his life is a succession of hardship and uncertainty, built on a narrative  of sufferance, endurance and hunger.

         These  elections are a watershed in the history of our country. The elections either  consolidate the fragile peace the country is experiencing, amidst the poverty and  unemployment, or retrogress it in the cesspit of backwardness. Keen on which direction  the country moves hinge on the collective decision we make as a people of this  space named Liberia. These elections are critical as our collective destiny is  tied to the outcome of the process.

         The Iraqi Kurdish  referendum vote for independence, scheduled for September 25, is more than  likely to pass by an overwhelming majority of the Kurdish population. Sadly,  however, not a single country (with the exception of Israel) expressed its  support for the Kurds’ impending historic decision to finally realize their  decades-old dream of establishing a state of their own. Although the passage of  the referendum will not automatically lead to statehood, it represents a  crucial step forward that opens the door for negotiations with the Shiite-led  government in Baghdad to reach an agreement.

         Following 14 years of civil unrest, Liberia appreciated a  fragile peace from 2003 until its democratically-elected government took the  wheels in January 2006. As a nation, we moved on and rose above our hurts despite  our frustration and anger; we settled on the foundation of reconciliation to  put Liberia's interest ahead of ours.

         With a crowded field of over  twenty Presidential candidates and just about twice as many legislative  candidates, no can rule out the possibility of legal challenges arising before  the Supreme Court whose credibility was severely eroded by its recent decisions  on the Code of Conduct. But just why President Sirleaf has allowed or  encouraged such blatant violation of the country’s electoral laws to persist,  although being fully aware that Korkoya, as a U.S. national is legally  incompetent over the elections, is the question she must answer to posterity.

         We do not need President Trump to tell  us that he can make America great again. America is already great. The problem  is that we are squandering our greatness by pursuing foreign and domestic  policies that debase our moral authority and the values that made America great  in the first place. We must change course, but for that we need leaders with  vision, courage, and determination which is sorely lacking. The best and the  brightest who can in fact chart a new path have become disillusioned with  politics, making the prospect of renewal increasingly difficult. It is time for  every American patriot to raise their voice and remind one another of what  makes America a great nation and what it stands for.

         So, who actually started or  reignited the dreaded Natives versus Congua divide in this election?  I  certainly did, and Mr. Joseph Nyumah Boakai have been blamed by Liberty Party  presidential candidate Charles Walker Brumskine of making this ugly divide in  our history a campaign issue.  I will set the record straight.Mr. Brumskine is like the  proverbial man who lives in a glass house and throws stones at by-passers, and  cries wolf when the by-passers return his favor.This hypocrisy by Brumskine  needs to be exposed after he and the Congua have thrived on this divide at the  expense of the native majority since the beginning of our nationhood nearly 200  years now.

           What Are The Implications Of A “Single Currency” For The Next Government  And Liberian People?

         <br/>
         In  the midst of uncertain general elections an important law has been passed by  the House of Representatives to make “Liberia a single currency country.”  Astonishingly, hardly anybody or even the  Presidential candidates said anything on the timing or the possible impact of  such a crucial law on the  economy  and lives of the Liberian people. Yes, I am  no economist, but I think there are some very pertinent questions to be aware –  if the next government is to avoid a harder economic landing.

         Senator Varney Sherman has drawn  the "Red Line" in the sand telling President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to  literally get lost that the presidential campaign of VP Joseph Nyumah Boakai  " does not need her support" means it is going to be a bloody fight  to the finish. So be vigilant till the end. This is what many of us who support Mr. Boakai have been saying the last few  years. But the honorable and respected Mr. Boakai will not come out ranging as  Senator Sherman. Others must do the dirty work for him and Sherman is quite  suited for the fight. It is one thing for Ellen to dabble in her lip service and lukewarm support for  Mr. Boakai, while at the same time, she is still encouraging the exodus of  party hierarchies to leave the party. This disdain and contempt for Mr. Boakai  by Ellen is so apparent for all to see.

         I find it extremely hard to call you “President Trump” because  sadly for America, you neither act like a president nor speak like one. You  neither have the moral authority that a president needs to project, nor the  courage of one. You have neither the vision of an enlightened president, nor  the diplomatic savvy of one. You have neither the capacity to lead the nation  as president, nor the competence of one. You have neither the credibility that  the president must enjoy, nor the ability to get things done. You have neither  the stability that the president must demonstrate, nor the consistency of one.  You do not have the country’s interest at heart like a president, nor the grasp  of what America’s role in world is all about. Here is why:

         Corruption is a  serious threat to the Liberian society. Like a vicious disease it tears away at  the systems and institutions that should work to address national development challenges  like illiteracy, health-delivery care, unemployment, among several. Society is  being robbed of scarce and valuable resources that can be used to undertake  substantive development transformation by some individuals in positions of  public trust. Howbeit, the threat of corruption is not delimited to individuals  in positions of public trust, it slithers through society with almost every  known established institutional structure including the family, being  suspicious and needing some form of query.

           American Passports and Green Cards with “Dry Face” Easily Infiltrated a  Leaky Elections System: Prototype of an Audacity to Bamboozle a Sovereign Nation

         I considered recent confusion generated by claims and  counter claims regarding Liberians who are holders of American passports.  Overtime, it has been alleged that these citizens of the United States of  America, instead of fronting for political positions in their country, have  surged on Liberia and qualified by the National Elections Commission (NEC) to  vie for presidential and legislative seats. While focus is on American passports,  there is another group who are “green card” holders in possession of US and  Liberian voting cards; they are either in government, or in the race. Suffice  these claims to be true, it can be safely declared that these people have “Dry  Face”; they are shameless, and brave enough to infiltrate the leaky NEC elections  system and bamboozle our sovereign nation.

         President Trump’s new strategy that would presumably win the war  against the Taliban in Afghanistan is doomed to fail, just like Bush’s and  Obama’s before him. At best, the reported dispatch of an additional 4,000  American troops as recommended by his security chiefs will prevent the total  collapse of Afghanistan and thwart the Taliban from winning. Given the complex  nature of the conflict, however, the status quo will not change in any  significant way.

I retrospect the  divisiveness wrought by the Americo-Liberian supremacy doctrine that birthed  confusion, malice, wars, and the resultant gross mistrust and lack of transparency  that have become ours. Despite this retrospection, my pain was soothed by the  mere fact that through all the vicissitudes or changes of our history, whether  it was war or peaceful assembly, political filibustering or arm twisting;  whether it was corruption and squandering of the nation’s wealth, nepotism or abuse  of human rights or respect for rule of law

Jonathan Gant, Global Witness campaigner said: “The LRA, if  passed, should recognise that communities own their land and ensure local  communities – and only local communities – have the power to say where their  lands are and how they should be managed.” Global Witness believes that any Act that does not protect the  ownership and management rights of rural landowners should be rejected by the  legislature. If the legislature passes a law that does not protect these  rights, the law should be vetoed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

         Much has been written about Syria’s civil war which has engulfed  the country for the past six years, but sadly the mounting death and  destruction in Syria has long since become mere statistics. The international  community grew comfortably numb to the horror, the likes of which we haven’t  seen since World War II. Both internal and external players have been nurturing  their vested interests by prolonging the deadly conflict, hoping to improve  their position to serve their long-term objectives. The irony is that none of  the external main players - Russia, Iran, US, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia - and the  domestic actors (the Assad regime, Sunnis, and Kurds) will end up with such  lasting gains that outweigh the horrifying losses that have been inflicted on  the country and its citizens.

           Unity Party Campaign "Dream Team": Where Is The Platform?

          Editorial

         <br/>
         At last, a campaign team for VP Joseph  Nyuma Boakai’s bid for the presidency in the ensuing 2017 General Elections has  been constituted. Considered in some quarters as his dream team, it comprises  high - profile Boakai supporters, and we are told that more names may be added  to the list. In a word, this is a good start although it is apparently a little  too late.         But, we would have imagined, what Liberians and Boakai  well-wishers want is not a mere list of names comprising, perhaps, a  combination of credible and corrupt individuals alike lining up for a job fair.  Liberians are longing for a plausible cum achievable platform, an expressed set  of core goals about how the VP is going to tackle the country’s numerous  socio-economic and political problems if elected a successor to President  Sirleaf.

         I had been wondering why an American official made a statement  recently that the United States does not support anyone candidate in the  Liberian elections. Now I guess it was to pre-empt the Madam that as a  “democratically” elected President she should not be going around like some  dictator telling her “colleagues” who will inherit her throne. Instead, she  should have been reassuring them that the Liberian voters were mature and wise  enough to elect the best leader to succeed her and rule the country  effectively.

         conversation  regarding dual citizenship reminds me of the Liberian proverb, “Teeth and  tongue may fight; they cannot separate”. Indeed, how many times during their  occasional battles in our mouths haven’t we felt an excruciating pain? You see,  when God created man, by design, God intended each part of His handmade to work  together. One may ask, why? The answer is found in that aforementioned proverb.  And, for example, organs such as the mouth, cheek, tongue, teeth and throat  need each other like links on an assembling line in a manufacturing plant. Thus  in order for them to perform as Our Almighty Father stipulated they have to  cooperate

         Iraq, once the cradle of  civilization, has and continues to experience one of the most horrific violent  conflicts in modern history that defies any semblance of civilized humanity. It  is hard to imagine the mammoth death and destruction that has been inflicted on  the Iraqi people by foreign powers and domestic terrorism. Yet, the country can  still overcome the horrors of the past 14 years, provided its leaders correctly  reassess the changing regional and domestic dynamics and agree to allow all  Iraqis, regardless of their sect and cultural orientation, to choose their own  political and civil structure.

         Visitors to the Frick  Collection in New York City will likely be familiar with the magnificent Self  Portrait (1658) of Rembrandt that hangs in the main gallery. The artist  presents himself as an imposing father-figure, like some patriarch of old. His  dress is formal, and utterly distinctive – a gold apron, a red sash – while his  prominent and imposing hands proclaim his trade. And yet beneath that  intimidating, almost royal, exterior is an unmistakable vulnerability, a  strength borne of having suffered life's calamities, and emerged from the awful  trials that the world inflicts upon one and all.

         Eight  score and ten years ago, Liberia was conceptualized, conceived, and birthed as  the land of freedom, liberty, and dignity of man. For the freed black American  slaves, it symbolized release from the scourge and the bondage of human slavery  in the American South. The American Colonization Society (ACS) established this  new nation, the second black Republic in history, on the West Coast of Africa,  bringing the autochthonous into the realm of western civilization.

         The most vital and clear-cut pathway to propelling transformative social change and  inclusive growth in Liberia is through youth development and sustainable  agriculture. It is no secret that agriculture is the backbone of our economy  with over 80% of our people living in  abject poverty, earning less than US$2 per day, and relying primarily on  small-scale subsistence farming as their primary source of income, food, nutrition  and survival.

         It has been ten years since Hamas defeated the Palestinian  Authority in Gaza and assumed control over the territory. Today, the  socio-economic conditions in Gaza are so horrendous that if nothing is done  immediately, the whole area is bound to explode in the face of Hamas, Israel,  and the international community. When that happens, you can count on Israel’s  and Hamas’ leaders to blame the other for allowing the situation to deteriorate  to this perilous point. Both sides are equally guilty of an egregious betrayal  of their own people.

I hesitated once in addressing my  audience when this question, “Would you consider yourself to be a good  politician for Liberia?” was posed to me.

         The National Code of Conduct (CoC) - a 22-page  document - should have been this regime’s Magna Carta to moralize Liberia’s  political life now and the future. It should have been signed by every  government official, framed in gold and hanged along with the picture of the  imperial President behind the desk of each state  official and in all public places for  posterity. But, like all the hundreds of national documents and agreements  drafted with millions of dollars evaporated in thin air - while the nation is  abandoned to bleed and suffocate in mass poverty, hopelessness and disorder -  it too was forgotten since enactment in 2014.

         Another Independence Day is just 48  hours away, but what is there to celebrate? Independence Day is not just about  celebrating age, but celebrating fulfilled promises. Our sovereignty as a  country goes far beyond
         <strong>
          THE DECLARATION  OF INDEPEDENCE.
         </strong>
         It epitomizes how far we have come as a nation in terms of  achieving genuine prosperity, reconciliation, peace, justice and equality. It  commemorates socio-economic parity and eulogizes political freedom. Is Liberia  different from what it was 170 years ago? The fact after almost 2 centuries is  that Liberia and Liberians are free on the PAPER, but not free in RELITY.
         <strong>
          Independence is not merely about  celebrating age in poverty and misery, but celebrating longevity in prosperity,  equality and justice for ALL.

         Despite the few riotous reactions to the opinions in Part One, there is  something crystal clear beneath the dark armpit of the UP architecture: Unity Party  as it was before the Nuquay pick, along with all the euphoria for a Boakai presidency  from within and without, is never going to be the same again. Crisis has set  in. Disgruntlement never thought off is seething about. Harmony has shrunk and  ongoing efforts to downplay the aftereffects of the Nuquay selection and to  heal the resultant internal disquiet and instability will hardly return the  party to status quo ante.

         Sixteen years have  passed and we are still fighting a war in Afghanistan which is not only the  longest in American history (at a cost approaching one trillion and the blood  of thousands of brave soldiers), but one which is morally corrupting from which  there seems to be no exit with any gratification but shame. It was necessary to  invade Afghanistan to destroy al-Qaeda following 9/11, but once it was defeated  we should have departed, leaving behind some residual forces to clean up the  mess.

One Hundred Thousand United States dollars  (US $100,000) obtained from American citizens taxes was given to the ACS by the  U. S.

         Nothing  eloquently exposes the hollowness of Unity Party’s sermonized pledge of forming  a coalition of new progressive forces, others call it rainbow forces, towards  building an inclusive government than Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai’s  vice standard-bearer pick. The political sermon paraded by proponents of the  party before the deadline-choked pronouncement of Margibi County’s Emmanuel  Nuguay was that a new Unity Party was being built to replace President Ellen  Johnson Sirleaf’s “exclusive and vindictive regime” - a regime they believe hardly  forgives its critics and which keeps traditional political foes on the national  leadership margin

         The Truth  and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) process and its recommendations did not  identify these perpetrators at the time because of limited time and resources. Notwithstanding,  the TRC Report recommended further investigations, which are now currently  ongoing, into the activities of perpetrators who lied to the TRC, avoided the  TRC or were completely unidentified by the TRC. And under these  recommendations, any persons, perpetrators, groups or individuals found to be  in the same position or standing before the TRC process as those already named  or identified by the TRC, are subject to the same findings, determinations and  recommendations of the TRC...

         It is hard to imagine  that along with the catastrophe that has been inflicted on Syria for the past  six years, another calamity is unfolding in Yemen of damning proportions while  the whole world looks on with indifference. What is happening in Yemen is not  merely a violent conflict between combating forces for power, but the willful  subjugation of millions of innocent civilians to starvation, disease, and ruin  that transcends the human capacity to descend even below the lowest pit of  darkness, from which there is no exit.

         Foreign  control of Liberia’s economy, especially essential businesses is not only a  threat to the social and economic development of our citizens, it is a significant  national security risk that if left unaddressed, will continue to deprive and  subjugate Liberians, thereby reducing them to be mere spectators of  developments in their country. This is a violation of their basic rights.  Liberians must own and control their economy that would allow them to succeed  in their country and ensure the safety and prosperity of the nation. I am not  against foreign investment, who would be? But it has to be done in a way that  embraces our foreign partners while at the same time ensuring Liberians’  ownership and control of the overall economy.

         While 34 out of 38 members of the House of  Representatives voted in favour of granting a national counterproductive tax  break favouring a Lebanese business firm, some senators have rejected the  president's request to grant such an anti-country tax incentive to her foreign  crony. We want to not only commend the resilience of those leaders who stood  against the Madam Ellen's kleptomaniac but we are also urging those senators to  remain firmed on their decision to ably protect the interest of this land and  it's people and graduate from protecting foreign monopoly capital against  ordinary Liberian entrepreneurs that are left struggling.

The interest of every  patriotic leader is to leave behind a legacy full of dignity, pride and public  honor. Time is running out for Africa’s first female President to salvage her  legacy after almost 12 years of democratic rule and 14 years of ceaseless  peace.

Such is the case with  Liberians, especially eligible voters. Can any Liberian-owned hotel be given  even 1-year tax holiday in Lebanon even after investing US$20 million? Can any  Liberian construction company get even US$1 million contract to pave a 1-mile  interior road in Lebanon? Can a Liberian businessman be given the leverage to  import even toothbrushes to Lebanon? Liberia has become a mafia state under  Nobel Laureate EJS.

Erdogan does  not understand that he cannot wish the Kurdish problem away—a problem that will  continue to haunt him and the country for countless more decades unless a  solution is found that respects their cultural and fundamental human rights.

         In search of a flourishing  democratic space with new hope which propels our nation towards an irreversible  dais of equality, justice, economic freedom, national unity and peace, I  profoundly bring you thoughtful compliments ahead of Liberia’s 170th  Independence Day celebration. With just 21 more days for  Liberians in country and abroad to memorialize yet another Independence Day, I  thought to cautiously evoke your conscience as a prominent statesman whose  voice and action could change a lot in Liberia. With confidence and optimism, I  hope you embrace this communiqué in good faith.

As part of those 20 promises, these were Madam Sirleaf’s words to all  Liberian voters during the campaign period in 2011...

         Many thanks to you all for your contribution to this  important debate. Well, brother Sylvester Moses, I assume that Mr. Andrew Worth  does not share your view that many countries have instituted a mixed economy.  For instance, the United States provides welfare programs for the poor and it  also assists big businesses through cash contributions during financial  meltdowns (i.e., 2008 financial debacle) or it initiates and, or finances  research, which ends up generating huge profits for companies such as  Microsoft.

         Over the years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been characterized, and  for good reasons, as the most intractable and irreconcilable conflict since the  Second World War. The status quo erodes every day the prospect of a solution,  but the changing geopolitical winds in the Middle East have created a new  opportunity to resume peace negotiations. The newly elected French President,  Emmanuel Macron, has a golden opportunity to take up the initiative on the  basis left by his predecessor.

         Is capitalism having a bad coverage? Well, many voters under capitalism are having  more doubts about the benefits of this economic system or “trickle down theory.”  In a 2016 Poll, Harvard University found that 51 percent of young American  voters rejected capitalism and have positive views about socialism, similar to  the conclusion of the 2011 Pew Poll. President Donald Trump, then U.S.  presidential candidate stated that, “America’s economic system is rigged;” U.S.  Senator Bernie Sanders stated that had Americans been under socialism the price  of a medicine would not have increased from $40 in 2001 to $40,000 in 2016. In  the 6/14/17 NY Times newspaper, he concluded that capitalism “is a dismal  failure.”

         Why give a 30-year tax holiday or  tax break to a Lebanese hotel – The  Farmington Hotel owned by Lebanese businessman George E. Abijaoudi when no  Liberian-owned hotel has even received a tax holiday for 1 year or even 6 months?  Why go into a US$59.5 million Pre-Financing Loan Agreement with a bogus foreign  company and at the same time serve as a guarantor with just 6 months to go?  With few months to go, there is a huge rush to bag millions without any respect  for established laws/rules and the sense of patriotism.  The LAST  THING lawmakers must do is to reject these shady deals, 4G agreements and  glaring economic conspiracy against the people’s interest.

         Last week I sent an open  letter to Prime Minister Netanyahu, criticizing him in the strongest terms for  pursuing policies that prolong the occupation of the West Bank rather than  searching for ways to end it by resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based  on a two-state solution. I must hasten to say, however, that you, along with  Hamas’ leaders, have contributed your own share to the continuation of the  occupation that has deepened the plight of the Palestinian people.

         In furtherance of its resolve to remove Jerome George Korkoya as Chairman of the National Election Commission due to his illegal and dubious citizenship status, the National Democratic  Coalition (NDC) and other collaborating parties have finally dragged the NEC criminal suspect to court. We have prima facie evidence that the  current Chairman of NEC is an American, not a Liberian citizen. Dual citizenship is illegal and is criminal in Liberia. He lied under oath to be confirmed by the Liberian  Senate as Chairman  of  NEC. As a foreign citizen serving as the Chair of NEC, Korkoya  has also violated the much talked about Code of  Conduct, which he promises to enforce  to the  letter.  These, among other violations, make Korkoya a  criminal suspect

         Since you celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the victory of  the Six Day War, did you ponder what this triumph has done to the Palestinian  people and to the moral character of the state of Israel? I am not sure how  harshly history will judge you, but one thing is certain - I, like millions of  Jews around the world, deeply believe that no prime minister of Israel has done  more damage to the country’s future security and wellbeing than you have. The  sad irony is that for you, the facts on the ground are freely expungable in  your morally distorted universe.

         Let me venture into a seemingly  potentially catastrophic political terrain today: talking about highly  sensitive stakes and about desperately determined political blocs in the  crucial 2017 election. No doubt, everyone has his political dislikes and the  reasons for them in any elections. I do have mine which surely overarch and  resonate with many Liberians. The difference is, others dare talk about them  openly as I do now. Despite the swarm of political  parties toward election date and all the claims of one being different from the  other, a careful scrutiny narrows them all. And that comes out in two great  wars that will be fought but silently or subtly - not overtly.

The extensive exhibition includes nearly one hundred  significant works on loan from the Mugrabi Collection, which includes acrylics  and oils, as well as drawings, silkscreen prints, and ceramics completed  between the years of 1981 and 1987

         The rapid increase in rent or mortgage, which makes up a  significant portion (45%) of the high cost of living (www.citylab.com), is  making life difficult for citizens as well as governments around the world. And  the high cost of living, experts complain, creates an unfavorable economic  environment for good-paying job-investors. Instead of debating a reform policy  in order to reduce the housing cost, politicians look for a scapegoat.

         Sadly, President Trump’s  visit to the Middle East only confirmed my skepticism about what might come out  of it. Trump went to the region with nothing to offer to mitigate the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict and received no commitment from either Israeli or  Palestinian leaders to resume the peace negotiations in earnest, but he  received lots of platitudes and empty good-will gestures.

         Some sicknesses are physical and others are  psychological. And when you talk to theologians or pastors, Imams, and Rabbis,  they might tell you to add morality and spirituality to the list. Liberia is a unique and pitiful environment  because our real sickness is not that we are that bad a people, or that we  don't have a human mind and the five senses needed to think and solve our  internal social, economic, political and lack of development problems.

         Israel will soon reach  on June 5th the grim milestone of fifty years of occupation of the West Bank.  Many Israelis have become complacent and succumbed to the government’s argument  that the continuing occupation is necessary to safeguard Israel’s national  security. Others are lamenting the day, as they view the occupation not only as  a gross violation of Palestinian human rights, but a real menace to Israel’s  democratic nature and Jewish national character.

         In a period of 12 months (FY2016-2017), Liberia  is spending over US$10.2 million on just six (6) public offices, namely:

          President, Vice President, Speaker, Senate  Pro Tempore, Deputy Speaker and Chief Justice.
         </strong>
         The budget of these six  offices far exceeds the two biggest referral hospitals in Liberia: JFK Medical  Center (US$5.3 million) and Jackson F. Doe Hospital (US$2.9 million). Where  does the interest of the people lie? The budget of these six offices in 12 months  could pay 571 medical doctors per annum

         Cllr Brumskine, as we move  towards a very pivotal epoch (October 10, 2017) in our country’s existence, I  am one of those in the youth and students’ community that elected not to dive  into superficial political debates. This is because they are immaterial to the  poverty and misery of the mass of Liberians. In these ensuing elections, I have  always stressed that the debate in our political theatre should always  highlight candidates’ history of service and the ideas they bring to the table.  If this is inculcated in our political culture like in other democracies in the  region, it will augur well for us as a nation and people.

           The Tragedy of Liberian Media

         An American Politician, Christopher  Dodd once said, “When the public's right  to know is threatened, and when the rights of free speech and free press are at  risk, all of the other liberties we hold dear are endangered.” The media in Liberia remains an integral and indispensable  embodiment of our democracy. Allowing World Press Freedom Day to pass on  without honoring the legacy, courage and resilience of Liberian Journalists  would be a disservice.

         We are approximately one-hundred sixty (160) days plus  away to the issuance of the expiration verdicts to those political convicts whose  manifestos seem opposite to the plights of the people. The wide range of  disagreements and condemnations that have stretched through corridors of the  nation’s social, economic, and political hemispheres flavored the outcome of  these Elections to be crucial and above all a boost for our struggling  democracy. Yet, the vast of people are still in a state of dilemma as to who to  entrust with power come October 10, 2017.

         Friday, March 17, 2017  was one of those days the family had hoped that Gedimina Flomo (popularly known  as GG) was succeeding in the fight against death. We felt somehow  optimistic because GG, about two weeks ago, had escaped from the traps of  death. News about the death of GG had gone global through social media. Later  we learned that GG’s condition was critical, but was still alive. So, yes, when  GG’s physicians informed us about his improvement the night before, we had hope  that the Almighty God would save GG from death

This is because in nearly 170 years ordinary Liberians are yet to  experience the ascendency of legacy-driven individuals to positions of  power.  Instead, the political and economic predatory ones.

         Liberia may be famous for its  barbaric 14-year civil war, but it’s also known with the exception of Ethiopia as  the oldest and the first independent nation on the continent of Africa. The  latter usually comes with high expectations for first time visitors and  tourists to Liberia. Those expectations are immediately dashed upon seeing the  underdeveloped state of the Roberts International Airport (RIA) road while in  route to the city.

The landmark ruling sends a      clear message that those who profit from war will be held to account, and      sets a significant legal precedent in recognizing that trading arms for      natural resources is a war crime.

         Gus van Kouwenhoven, a businessman of Dutch origin, succeeded in buying up or otherwise acquiring 5 concessions in Southeast Liberia (Grand Bassa, River Cess and Sinoe counties) in the late 1990s, totalling a good part of the SE Liberian forest block. With these large holdings in hand, many other concessions (mostly inactive?) were seized to put together a concession stretching from just north of Buchanan east across River Cess county and into Sinoe county (perhaps up to the boundary of the Sapo National Park according to one report). No maps of the concession area are publicly available, however, it varies between 2,500,000 acres (900,000 hectares) to 4,000,000 acres (1.44 million hectares). Mr. van Kouwenhoven reached a "management agreement" with FDA for this forest area; again, this agreement is not publicly available and may not withstand contestation in court.

         Again, the Sirleaf government,  through cunning machinations, has bought itself some time from falling under  the quantum weight of the triumphant march of the masses of Liberians onto the  stage of history. It now shamelessly celebrates its perceived victory over the  people’s struggle for economic freedom, thus confirming its anti-democratic  credentials.

         The Ebola crisis is often presented as an epilogue to a broadly successful and inspiring feminist political career. However, Ms. Johnson Sirleaf’s early history as a crusader for reform has been tarnished by a decade of rule in which her judgment and integrity have been repeatedly called into question. Official corruption continues to be a constant source of local headlines and outrage. It doesn’t help that her stepson runs the Liberian National Security Agency, another son is chairman of the Central Bank and yet a third ran the national oil corporation.

         Liberians,  once again, are hoping that a change in leadership after 2017 their country will  address Liberia’s issues: generate adequate revenue, finance electricity to  entice good-paying-job investors, finance social programs, fight corruption,  etc. Yet, the candidates are focusing on the issue of personality or ethnicity  rather than the issue of adequate revenue, for example. Why does Liberia, with  significant deposits of natural resources such as diamonds, continue to rely on  excise taxes (i.e., money taken away from the pockets of citizens) to finance  its budgetary documents?

         Col. Coleman, on January 4, 2017  precisely, a young and industrious Liberian woman whose name is Sonah James, 26  years old, was severely brutalized by some officers of the Police Support Unit  (PSU) around Buchanan Street, central Monrovia. Sonah, a vendor of sandwich bread,  had come from selling after the County Sports Meet on the Antoinette Tubman  Stadium (ATS) when this unfortunate incident occurred. While en route to her  residence almost 40 feet away from Buchanan Street, she was raided, knocked  down and whipped with a rattan in her right eye.

         Indeed,  the notion of “Vote-Rich Nimba County” is the expression of reality. It is the  statement of the number of eligible, voting-age citizens in the county.  But, the notion of
         <strong>
          “PYJ,

         as the
         <strong>
          Messiah or  Savior

         of the County and its citizens, who controls the votes of Nimba  County ” is something else - debatable at best, and a myth at worse.

         Liberia has a lot to learn from  Tanzania especially under the administration of a patriot par excellence,  President John Pombe Joseph Magufuli.  The United Nations made no mistake to have named Magufuli as the best President  on planet earth just in a period of 12 months of his presidency. This global  and prestigious accolade came as a result of
         <strong>
          “Less Talking”

         and
         <strong>

         This is  a catch 50/50 situation facing our people. But the great deal maker Trump can  reach a deal with Liberia. Just keep reading. The Liberian refugees didn’t ask  to come to America but were forced to leave Liberia because of the few  power-hungry politicians who lived in America only to study/plan the  destruction of their own country through war. They've gained political power  through the barrel of the gun and only to enrich themselves while our people  wallow in grinding poverty and misery.

         The growing tension between Turkey and its Western allies, which  was further heightened during the Obama administration, is narrowing the space  for cooperation between the two sides and in fact is progressively worsening.  Erdogan’s hope that he and President Trump would improve their ties as members  of NATO has dramatically diminished. Washington and the EU still deeply  disagree with Ankara on a host of issues, which are unlikely to be resolved on  a mutually gainful basis any time in the foreseeable future.

         The  National Democratic Coalition (NDC)            calls on Liberians everywhere not to be  disinformed by Cllr. Charles W. Brumskine and the Liberty Party about the  sociopolitical realities of Liberia. In addressing rumors that President Ellen  Johnson Sirleaf prefers and is quietly supporting Cllr. Brumskine to succeed  her as the next President of Liberia, the Liberty Party political leader, Cllr.  Brumskine, mischaracterized Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai and wrongly depicted  him as someone employing the “Congo–Country divide” in politics in Liberia! Sadly,  Cllr. Brumskine, who was once a strong supporter of Charles Taylor whose record  is unhidden regarding the destruction of Liberia and his plan to destabilize  the sub-region, tacitly likened Vice President Boakai to self-serving  individuals

         As we approach the sixth  year of Syria’s civil war, the whole international community remains completely  inept and has failed to join together in the search for a solution that could  end the horrifying slaughter of thousands of innocent civilians each month.  Sadly (but for obvious reasons), each of the countries and other groups  involved, including Russia, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the US, the Assad  government, and the rebels, are focused solely on what best serves their own  national interests.

         On January 16, 2006, when Ellen Johnson Sirleaf became  President of Liberia, she raised the hopes of many Liberians of a new day in  Liberia and inspired the confidence of  the International community when she declared “war against corruption as public  enemy number one.” The President dashed the hopes of the Liberian people  and the international community, further in government’s commitment to fighting  corruption when she failed to reappoint former Auditor General John Morlu.

         I followed recent developments regarding  the March 3rd Ruling of the Supreme Court on the Code of Conduct and  your subsequent press statement in public media of your determination to uphold  and/or enforce the Code of Conduct as a constitutional prerogative to which the  NEC is obliged. What has drawn my attention, Mr. Chairman is how you intend to  enforce the Code of Conduct in ways that will not plunge our country into an  abyss of chaos, political instability and civil crisis.

Policy based on common assumptions and popular sentiments can  become a recipe for mistaken prescriptions and misguided interventions.”

         It is a hoary and a trite  concept that presidential election is won by the collective value and message  of the team (presidential and vice presidential candidates). A single  candidate, no matter the marquee status and position in society, cannot match  the well-suited and strategically positioned combination of two individuals  with seamless attributes for overall success. In 2005, it was not only the international  acclamations and “iron lady” traits that won the elections for Madam  Sirleaf.  It took the president  considerable time to invest in the thoughtfulness of choosing someone who could  fill out and connect the missing links to her grand cavalcade as Africa’s first  democratically elected female president.

With such an increase in old age, coupled with the fact that one in  five live on less than a dollar a day, Africans should not only institute  social programs such as retirement fund, rather effective retirement funds that  will help to alleviate poverty amongst the elderly, the UN advised.

           There had been, and is, rigid reality of a

            Divide
           </strong>
           – Socio-cultural, Ethnic-indigenous - between Liberians. It is the core of  Liberia’s socio-economic and political under-development since 1847. No level  of academic and intellectual verbal rationalizations can wish away this  reality.

         In most of  Africa of which Liberia is of no exception, education is most probably  considered as the leading qualification for national leadership. Overtime, this  mentality has proven false and futile. In some countries, even the most  educated or academically qualified have failed miserably and performed  dismally. Liberia is a perfect case to reference under President Ellen  Johnson-Sirleaf

         Although Prime Minister Netanyahu is known for his focus on the  Palestinian and Iranian threats to Israel’s national security, in recent months  he has increasingly sounded the alarm over Iran in particular rather than the  Palestinians. As the defeat of ISIS in both Iraq and Syria is all but  inevitable, Netanyahu’s main concern now is that Iran will insist on  maintaining a strong foothold in Syria by establishing a significant military  presence as recompense for its continuing support of the Assad regime  throughout the civil war

         The  stakes have never been higher in Liberia’s recent political history. For the  first time ever since the death in 1971 of President Tubman and the smooth  peaceful accession to power of his vice president, the country will be  witnessing what is expected to be a peaceful transition of power from a 12 year  ruling incumbent to a new democratically elected successor.

         It  is over for Dr. Mills Jones and others who are trapped under the weight of the  Code of Conduct (COC) law. In the 2023 presidential elections, we will be  talking about precedent set under the COC law and the finality over the law  based on this ruling by the Supreme Court of Liberia on March 3, 2017. And so  we move on to the potential next hurdles: the 10-year residency clause and the  dual citizenship role of contestants.

This validates literally the “call to arms” that we tribal  people need to unite to contest the presidential elections in October. Ellen  and the Americo-Liberians/Congua see Liberia only as their money-making  plantation.

He uses religion to present himself and his political agenda as if it  is being sanctioned by a higher authority, surreptitiously uses Islamic symbols  to indoctrinate the population with religious precepts, and promotes Islamic  studies in schools in order to cultivate a new generation of devout Muslims  loyal to him.

In  addition to the many New Year’s resolutions, it is the year in which Liberians  are expected to go to the polls to elect a president along with 73  representatives for the next six years. The process that has commenced with a  voters’ registration exercise has seen many first-time voters forming long  queues just to exercise their right as Liberian citizens. While it is true that  many are reluctant and do not see the need to vote, others have mustered the  courage to effect the change they believe will continue the country’s path to  upward mobility

From amendments made to  the Liberia Revenue Code of 2011 by the National Legislature about two months  ago, taxes on goods and services were increased. Thus, the cost of production  of goods like water, juices, and alcoholic beverages, as well as  telecommunication services in the economy is now very high. Tariffs on goods  imported by our mothers and fathers have been increased. To free a container of  goods from the Free Port of Monrovia is extremely expensive.

         Why must a  poverty-stricken nation like Liberia spend over US$170.8 million in 4 years on  just 103 Lawmakers alone when education is a mess?  It is somehow difficult to determine which  branch of the Liberian government is the most corrupt and the most unpatriotic,  but one would reasonably crown the Legislative branch with such  characterization. Undeniably, Liberia has one of the most corrupt and unpatriotic  Parliaments in the World.

         Should I have waited and kept my mouth shut until Charles  Brumskine and VP Boakai pick their VPs? Then the damage would have gone beyond  repair. So, our fellow native Liberian politicians, please hear me. But what I  don't understand about these native political figures is, why must they run to  political parties headed by Congua only to lobby for VP positions? Why? Are  they not good enough to head the ticket and ask Congua or whoever to be VP to  them?

         Should President Trump fulfill his campaign  promise to relocate the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, it would  have major regional and international repercussions. The Trump administration  is currently reevaluating the implications of such a move and no final decision  has been made. Given the sensitivity and far-reaching consequences, if he  nevertheless decides to relocate the embassy it is critical that he  concurrently takes a balancing act to prevent the potentially disastrous  fallout.

That governments around the world that depend on American free money  needed to adopt new measures to be financially self-sufficient in running their  countries.

         President Dwight Eisenhower, in his farewell speech, on 01/17/1961,  warned Americans about many issues such as protecting special interest. In  Liberia, the warning about special interest came by way of three separate  violent actions: the Rights and Rice Demonstration on April 14, 1979; the military  coup on April 12, 1980; and the fourteen-year civil war launched on December  24, 1989.

From his reconsideration of CIA ‘black sites’ to his insistence on vast voter  fraud, to his inhumane ban on immigration from Muslim countries, Trump seems to  be intent on normalizing discredited policies, adhering to blatant falsehoods,  and waging an assault on human dignity.

         Unfair practices of the National Elections Commission (NEC) contribute to the  election of bad persons, persons who are corrupt and do not have the interest  of the poor people at heart.The unfair practices of  NEC are seen in allowing foreigners to run as candidates in elections, allowing  foreigners to vote in elections, placing the wrong names of candidates on  ballot boxes and determining a favored political party in advance of the 2017  election, when NEC announced publicly that the All Liberian Party is a  civilized party. All peaceful efforts must be used to change NEC because the  present NEC is not capable of organizing Fair Elections, especially in 2017.

         Yahya  Jammeh has finally left The Gambia – of course with so much credit to the resolve  of ECOWAS that the will of the Gambia people must be respected. Is this Africa  coming of age or is this just an aberration for a continent better known for  its failures and misadventures? Jammeh started out with the old dictator  refrain of non-interference and chest-pounding of his ability to fend off any  invasion by ECOWAS’ forces.

         Perhaps  already gone with the winds, but few weeks ago the outgoing  US President, Barack Obama,  was outraged when he  accused the Russian President, Vladimir  Putin,  of “manipulating” the US  presidential elections. A high treason, no doubt, and  his   reaction was immediate and retaliation commensurable.  And for us   who have been  subjected to  manipulations since eternity,  I believe  we could learn a lot from this script of these two World Powers, and take cue  to re-direct our national future.

         As a new  national election season gets underway in Liberia, all parties, citizens and  stakeholders must realize that a lot is on the line; perhaps it is fair to say everything  is on the line. The upcoming election and the administration chosen following  the EJS era will probably be the most important to glue together the nation’s  tapestry, especially its fragile peace that hangs in the balance. That is the  optimistic perspective. However, on the other hand, if we blow this chance and  choose recklessly, there is a potential to plunge our nation back onto the edge  of the abysmal pit of self-destruction. George Santayana, a Spanish-American  philosopher, essayist, poet and novelist left the grim reminder on the wall:  “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

         In part one  of this article, we discussed Merriam-Webster Dictionary’s word of the year,  surreal, and its impact on our collective sensibilities. It will not be a  stretch to proclaim Donald Trump’s successful presidential campaign as the most  surreal event in the world. Yes, although only a domestic election, is it not  written that “When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold”?  Besides the word surreal, we shall also examine two other words: ‘post truth’  and ‘xenophobia’, chosen by Oxford Dictionary and Dictionary.com, respectively.

         Time  is the ultimate rewarder of the deeds of man, whether good or bad or whatever  there may be besides these two. Solomon, the wisest human in bible history, hit  the cord of this maxim harmoniously when he writes in one passage in the  Ecclesiastics that “for everything there is a season, a time for every activity  under heaven.”

         "Turning and turning in the  widening gyre, the falcon cannot hear the falconer; things fall apart; the  centre cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, the blood-dimmed  tide is loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned" (William  Yeats).

         The  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf administration is setting the stage for civil  disobedience in Liberia. And if the administration is not careful, the  economic, social and political issues facing Liberia will again reached a  boiling point, which could become a matter of life or death for many innocent  people. During the last few months of 2016, the Christmas holiday shopping  season was a nightmare for over 80% of the Liberian people. The government's abrupt  austerity measure to raise revenue on the backs of the people so as to avert  budgetary shortfalls created by neglect, mismanagement, corruption and  carelessness was seriously unnecessary.

         For the past  several decades, lexicographers and other linguistic organizations have  observed a tradition of naming a word, or a group of words, as word(s) of the  year. This year, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary has chosen the word “surreal”  as its word of the year. A short definition reads: “very strange or unusual” or  “having the quality of a dream”.
