          for doing such a great job at our Wedding Reception, the dance floor was always busy and everyone had a great time. He judged the crowd very well with his mix of music and we continue to receive great feedback from our guests. I must say that the booking service through yourself was very professional and we always got a quick response from any queries. We will certainly not hesitate to recommend Buena Vista Entertainments in the future.

          <a href="/disc-jockeys-alan.asp">
           Alan
          </a>
          . It was epic. First and foremost I want to thank Alan who helped make it a fabulous day, he was professional throughout, we barely even noticed him setting up behind us. The music is such a big part of a night like ours and it was exactly what we were looking for, the right blend of our dodgy song requests and songs that actually got people up dancing. The best praise I can give a Alan is that the floor was full all night with lots of people commenting on how good the music was. Alan was also very accommodating with my mad-cap silent disco ideas which fitted in nicely during the buffet break. Alan made the effort a few times through the night of seeking me out to chat and make sure that everything was going as we wanted, a really good touch. Id like to also thank Buena Vista as a whole, the whole process of booking and selecting a DJ was made stress free and straight-forward  you can tell you guys are pros! I would certainly recommend you to anyone looking for entertainment. Andrew

Everything worked together very well and all the guests were complimentary of the music at the ceremony and drinks reception, they liked all the pieces played and said it brought a touch of class to the occasion. Rowan was extremely pleased with his clean bandit piece. Superb! The guests were thoroughly impressed with the evening entertainment and both Rowan and I liked the ceilidh best. Iain was great at guiding us through the dances, a superb service from the whole team. I am so grateful to you for ensuring the bookings and that everything went as planned. It was a pleasure doing business with you and found the process of booking, communication and payment trouble free and very responsive.

          We felt that you and your team were used to corporate events and managed to get everyone into the spirit of the game (which was no mean feat). You were  very friendly, organised and accommodating (when I asked to change the prize from 1 to 3). We felt that the level of the questions was well pitched. We all particularly enjoyed attempting to make balloon animals! Another aspect that we appreciated was that some of the funds are given to charity, which meant that whilst we were having fun we were also helping others.

          for an excellent performance on the night who more than lived up to our expectations.  They played very musically and not at all raucously (as some of our members had feared); they mixed instrumentals with dances; and Caroline performed one beautiful song (she'd been a bit hesitant when I asked her to do so earlier, but I think she should be encouraged to do so more often).  Caroline was an excellent caller and drew many of our often quite elderly members to the dance floor.
 
 All in all it was a very good evening, which was enjoyed by everybody who attended.  Please therefore pass on our appreciation to "Ceilidh Band 2". We'd certainly give them an excellent reference, if ever requested.

          performed at our wedding in Hilcroft Hotel, Whitburn, Friday 18 April and I just wanted to thank you all for a great night. Everyone has commented on how good you were and I really believe it made our wedding! We have also been asked by several people for your contact details which I have passed on.
  
 I'd also like you to pass our thanks on to Chris who dj'd that night. He was absolutely brilliant and managed to play the majority of the list we had produced and many more favourites.
  
 Thanks again for a great night.

He was really friendly and accommodating and everyone had a great time.  He was good fun and nothing was too much trouble! The booking process was really straight forward and selecting the first dance, last dance and other tracks we wanted worked really well. Thanks for arranging this, it is much appreciated.

          we knew it would be a great time for everyone. But the night itself was phenomenal and vastly surpassed all of our expectations. When we walked in, the room looked great  all the kit and sound effects that the lovely Martin did really added to the ambiance and Yasmin was the ideal lovely assistant. The game and questions were perfectly pitched to a very mixed crowd, ensuring everyone knew an answer, or at least had a fair chance of knowing an answer (like the morse-code S.O.S. of the Titanic!). The way you managed our rowdy bunch and at the same time involved our little niece, while keeping things moving and maintaining the extremely high fun level, was beyond impressive. I have not seen our family and friends laugh that hard, for that long, in ages - we all thought our cheeks were going to fall off! Everyone was talking about it for the rest of the night and the next day as well. We cannot thank you, Martin and Yasmin enough. With such a small number of people, the entertainment can make or break a weddings fun-factor and ours, thanks to you guys, was off the charts!!! Kelli Wiersema

We can't tell you how much we appreciate you playing EVERYTHING that we asked for, it made for the most perfect night and the only complaints were from the auld y'uns whose knees didn't permit them onto the dance floor, that we spent the entire night on the dance floor!!!

He was simply perfect for our event, he mingled beautifully with the crowd, wasnt overly pushy and due to the speed in which he creates the images, it was painless and seamless. Everyone said how friendly, efficient and professional he was.

They were the perfect band for this occasion and the majority of our crowd seemed to like them and enjoy the music (of course there will always be a few who don't like 'loud' music but I never received any negative comments from anyone). They were very accomplished musicians and vocals were excellent and would highly recommend them, and Richard. I believe a few people left asking for details of the band.

          did for us at our wedding, it really was first class and helped the day go so smoothly  looking back we honestly dont know how we would have coped without Richard's support and it was a great weight lifted off my shoulders that someone was there early in the day to help me and all the arrangements. Richard also added such a lot of nice touches that we noticed  always being there to help out or to attend to things and having two glasses of champagne ready.
 So a big thanks to Richard for an excellent job well done and also to Dougie for introducing us to his services.
