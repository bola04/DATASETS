       Coty's crew from Your Local Movers did a great job moving our family on June 18, 2016. The crew showed up on time and were completely equipped. They worked hard all day with only a lunch break and got our 4 bedroom house contents move in less time than the estimate. I will definitely hire "Your Local Movers"again.  Great Job. Thanks!

       The guys were so thoughtful, courteous, professional and detail oriented. They knew that we were exhausted from a long move from the United States and made this experience of moving our personal belongings from our garage to a storage facility easy. They anticipated our needs. My husband who never tips for services like this gave them each a gratuity! We will definitely use them again. Thank you your fair pricing and service.

       The team was helpful, prompt and efficient. They really made moving day go smoothly. It was raining pretty hard during the move and they were aware of keeping 
             both houses clean while they worked. They didn't complain once and were very respectful of our space and belongings. We will definitely reuse and recommend them 
             in the future.

       In January 2014, Cody and Connor moved a heavy stove to my home in Kitsilano.  They were prompt, courteous, and professional and were very careful to avoid any damage.  They set the new stove up properly and removed my old stove to take to recycling.  Their rates were very affordable.  I would most definitely call on them again for any future moves.

       I use to do a lot of staging and Your Local Movers were the go to  moving company for me.  I now have my own Interior Design Company and I  still call on My Local Movers at least once a month or more.  My father  has been a partner for over 55 years in Alberta for one of the largest  privately owned furniture moving companies in Western Canada so I know all about  furniture and how to move it.  The guys are on time, polite and don't  waste time which is important to me and my clients.  I would and have  recommend this company to any and all my friends and clients who ask me for my  personal choice of the best moving company in the lower mainland.

       Have used these guys professionally to help clients with set-up and remove staging furniture, as well as for my own  personal moves. They are consistently punctual, incredibly conscientious and always work quickly. They have helped numerous clients after my recommendation and have never heard anything other than rave reviews. Highly recommended and the only guys I'll call.

       On September 25th, Local Movers moved  35 years of house contents to Kits storage (a lot of stuff).  They were courteous, fast, very careful and affordable.They will soon move us to our new home in Whistler.  We highly recommend them.

       We hired Your Local Movers on Feb 28th, 2013. Coty and the other fellow who moved us were excellent. We had called 2 other larger local moving companies who gave us massive quotes to move our 2 bdrm apartment. We were relieved when Coty gave us his rate.  So affordable! They are clean-cut guys who do the job quickly and with a great attitude. They moved us on the wettest day of the year and they were so careful to make sure not one speck of dirt entered our old place and new place. We will definitely use Coty and his crew again in the future. Thank you Coty for making our move so easy!!

       On January 10, 2013 we hired Your Local Movers to assist us with loading our apartment into a moving truck in Kitsilano. The two gentlemen who assisted us were friendly, fast, and very efficient. My partner and I were considering doing the entire job ourselves, which in hindsight wouldve been a big mistake. We under estimated the time it would take to complete the job and the vehicle we rented (not from Your Local Movers) was too small. We were moving to a different city, and thanks to Your Local Movers, we made the ferry on time, and all our belongings arrived safely in one trip! Thank you very much for excellent work, your expertise saved us alot!

       I really can't thank Your Local Movers enough. I've moved a lot and it's always a stressful process, but the move I had to do last autumn was stressful on a 
             different level... it was unexpected, urgent and emotional. I had found myself in an unsafe living situation and needed to get out-- FAST. These guys were 
             efficient, professional, and good-natured. They put me at ease, and were incredibly flexible and understanding for a move that wasn't quite as straightforward as
             what I'm used to. Another big problem? I didn't have a place to transition to right away and my storage plans fell through. YLM actually helped me to find a 
             storage solution for a month and a half until I was able to move them into my new apartment! These guys went above and beyond; I would recommend them to anyone. 
             Thank you, Your Local Movers!
