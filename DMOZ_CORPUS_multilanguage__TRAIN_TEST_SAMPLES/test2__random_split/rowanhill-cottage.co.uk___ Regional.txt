     Rowanhill lies beside the very minor road serving the crofting area of
         Moss about two miles from the centre of the thriving village of
         Acharacle which is served by two hotels, a post office and tearoom, an
         excellent village store with all provisions, a bakery, fish and chip
         shop, and an Outdoors shop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rowanhill cottage is ideally placed for guests to enjoy fishing on Loch
         Shiel and in the River Shiel, also to enjoy the many other fieldsports
         in Lochaber and Ardnamurchan.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sandy beaches at Ardtoe are about 30 minutes drive and the beach at
         Dorlin with the commanding presence of Castle Tioram is only 10 minutes
         drive from Rowanhill Cottage.
     <br/>
     Castle Tioram is the fourteenth century stronghold of the MacDonalds of
         Clanranald with a wealth of Scottish history behind its crumbling
         ramparts burnt in the Jacobite Rising of 1715.

      "We went to Loch Ness. Yes we did see Nessie. The weather was very
           mixed and this lovely cottage held us warm and cosy through the rainy
           days"

     The Peal Family, July 2014:
     <br/>
     <em>
      "Well equipped comfortable Cottage.
      <br/>
      We enjoyed seeing an amazing variety of wildlife: pine martens, a pair
           of white-tailed sea eagles, a wild cat, a pair of red-breasted divers,
           and a golden eagle. All the neighbours have been very friendly. The
           walking is fantastic."

      <br/>
      "Loved the cottage, very comfortable. Lots of walks to beaches and
           mountains."
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      <br/>

           Another happy pooch unwilling to go home."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Blue skies and sun from 4.00am to 11.00pm all week. golfing at
           Traigh, cycling to Silver Sands, walk the Silver Walk and Castle
           Tioram, canoeing in Loch Shiel to the Green Isle"
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "So much to see and do. It was the wife's first visit to this part of
           Scotland and now she does not want to go home - we'll be back"
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Another wonderful visit. Rowanhill just perfect. Peaceful, relaxing,
           all the wonders of nature around."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Excellent accommodation, everything we needed was here. Surrounding
           walks are great, the dogs loved the beach at Kentra Bay."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "The Penmans came from Canada and said Rowanhill was worthy of 5
           stars. All loved this house and did not want to leave. We all leave
           with happy hearts and a feeling we were at home."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "A lovely cottage in a beautiful location!"
      <br/>
      <br/>

           rain."

      " An ideal place to explore the local area and the beauties of
           Ardnamurchan and Mull where we were lucky enough to see a Golden
           Eagle".
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "We really appreciated having wi-fi for checking weather forecasts,
           etc.
      <br/>
      Elk the dog is too depressed to leave. We had to lift her into the
           car!".
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Many thanks for the use of Rowanhill. Its comforts were again much
           appreciated. The garden was just at its best, and the surrounding
           countryside looking fantastic - a really good holiday".
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "We had a fantastic week at Rowanhill Cottage. The place was clean and
           tidy and in such a beautiful location. The fishing wasn't the best due
           to the sun splitting the sky for the full week but plenty of trout
           were caught and we also saw some magnificent wildlife including otters
           and sea eagles.
      <br/>
      Great place and great accommodation. Hoping to be back again next
           year".
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "We had a lovely holiday at Rowanhill and hope to return again in the
           not too distant future. The cottage was really comfortable and so well
           equipped - very homely. We explored much of the area, and although the
           weather was mixed, were able to take in the beautiful landscapes and
           scenery of Ardnamurchan and it's surroundings. We would love to visit
           again in a different season".
