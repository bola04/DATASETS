       A new century had come to America, but it 
         had yet to bring it from the age of darkness. People still lived by the 
         flickering light of flat wick oil or kerosene lamps. The dawn of the century 
         was about to change the lives of many people and one company would be 
         at the heart of bringing light into those lives. "The Mantle Lamp 
         Company of America" (later to become "Aladdin Industries Inc.") 
         was about to bring America forth from its darkness with a unique product--the 
         Aladdin mantle lamp.
      </div>
      <p align="left">
       Aladdin lamps were unique in the use of a round 
         wick to provide an even non flickering flame, and a rare earth mantle 
         that glowed to produce the light of a 60 watt light bulb when heated by 
         the flame from the kerosene lamp. The difference between the light of 
         the Aladdin lamps and any other oil or kerosene lamp was so great that 
         the company offered a one thousand dollar reward to any person who could 
         show them an oil lamp that could equal its light. The reward was never 
         collected, and by the early 1930's seven million Aladdins had been sold!
      </p>
      <p align="left">
       Aladdin was also one of the pioneers in modern 
         sales techniques and would allow customers to trade in their old oil lamps 
         on new Aladdin lamps. They were also one of the first companies to use 
         radio as an advertising medium in the Midwest. They paid Henry Field, 
         who owned the Henry Field Seed Company of Shenandoah, Iowa along with 
         a 1000 watt station KFNF, five hundred dollars to talk about their lamp 
         on his "Evening Letterbasket" program. Included in the program 
         was a cash offer of twenty five dollars for the best ten word slogan submitted. 
         The response was 2200 letters and 800 of those didn't even submit a slogan--they 
         just wanted more information on the lamp! Later radio stations to carry 
         adds included WLS Chicago, WHO Des Moines, and WSM Nashville. As radio 
         grew so did Aladdin's coverage until it covered the nation.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
       Aladdin lamps were manufactured in a wide variety 
         of styles. The first were made of metal, either brass or nickel plated 
         brass. There were several models of the metal lamps including table lamps, 
         bracket lamps, and some very unusual hanging lamps. The 1930's and 40's 
         saw lamps made of colored glass, and included the now much sought after 
         ruby crystal and cobalt blue, tall Lincoln drape Aladdin lamps. Another 
         lamp that became the best selling lamp in Aladdin's history was the Alacite 
         tall Lincoln drape. Alacite was a unique trademark of Aladdin and resembled 
         ivory in its color and texture. Moonstone glass was also unique to Aladdin 
         lamps and was so named because the glass itself seemed to glow like the 
         pale moon. The glowing quality of moonstone is as popular with collectors 
         today as it was with customers in the 1930's.

       Aladdin lamps have become very collectable today, 
         and for anyone interested in them, the following links will give you an 
         insight into their development, along with pictures to help you identify 
         the many different styles. I have devoted this site to the kerosene (oil) 
         lamps, although Aladdin also manufactured many unusual electric lamps 
         after the advent of electricity. For anyone wishing more information you 
         will find a link within this site to the Aladdin Knights web site which 
         is devoted in its entirety to collectors of all types of Aladdin Lamps. 
         I hope you enjoy this site, and that it may be of some benefit to you 
         as an owner, or collector of Aladdin lamps.
