            Some of the time I get on a call with a business rep/business dev… just to discover they don’t know anything about our organization. Some different circumstances they cite prominent clients – that have nothing to do with us.
           </p>
           <p>
            In one extraordinary case, a business rep was pushing an item that straightforwardly contends with something that we offer. Did I tune in to that rep? You wager I did! I got their value rundown, rebates and attempt to sell something… precious research, for nothing and in 30 minutes!
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s an extraordinary case, yet it mirrors a general issue: absence of care and research into the prospects you’re approaching. You may think outbound deals is about numbers and hit-proportion, and so on. I vary. It is tied in with being important.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another extremely normal case is when individuals include me LinkedIn. I find in their profile they’re in deals, and that they offer something that could conceivably be significant to me. However, they don’t much try composing a little note. With no introduction, it is evident you’re including numerous individuals unpredictably. Mass = untargeted. Untargeted = immaterial.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do this: Be important. Invest a little energy inquiring about your prospects previously you call. A couple of minutes on LinkedIn and on their site will enable you to tailor your pitch on the fly. Demonstrate your prospects that their business is important to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            2. Procure trust and concentrate on the long haul
           </p>
           <p>
            I’ve purchased utilized autos previously (the best esteem!) and I didn’t have a terrible ordeal. Nobody likes managing the cliché “Utilized Car Salesman”, however once in a while I feel I’m conversing with one.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are quite recently a few strategies that will just not work with most senior people you approach:
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagining you know my CEO (yes, individuals have attempted that!).
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagining (undermining!) that on the off chance that I don’t purchase today, you can’t ensure I’ll ever have the capacity to purchase from you. Believe me… I know advertisement stock isn’t precisely hard to find!
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagining you recognize what my necessities are on account of you simply sold an arrangement to one of my remote rivals. We may contend, yet our requirements are typically totally extraordinary.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a consistent idea there: imagining.

           <h4>
            <strong>
             Radio, newspapers and magazine specialists will frequently give free help in developing an advertising strategy. Things like demographic information, money-saving ways to produce your ads etc.
            </strong>
           </h4>
           <p>
            <strong>
            </strong>
            Place your ads in off hours or in unusual locations for less. Many times you can still reach your target market with these spots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead of a one-time big splash ad, be consistent with frequent small ads that work. Monthly magazines sometimes have unsold ad space at the end of the month they will sell at a discount.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have an 800 number, put it in every ad for immediate response and feedback.Try advertising consistently in the classifieds. These ads may draw more customers than more expensive display ads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you barter for the cost of ad production? Maybe the newspaper needs painting in exchange for an ad about your paint store. Piggyback advertising are the ads you receive with your Mastercard bill. Is there someone in your town that sends out a lot of bills? Can you put a small flyer in with their bills and split the postage? Or pay a small fee?
           </p>
           <p>
            Split advertising costs with the people who sell to you. Vendors and manufactures are always looking for exposure. Let people know you carry their products and have the vendor pick up part of the ad cost.
           </p>
           <h3>
            <strong>
             Are there up front advertising discounts for cash?
            </strong>
           </h3>
           <p>
            Consider advertising in regional issues of national magazines. The costs are lower and you can still reach your target market. TV Guide is a good choice. It stays around for at least a week. Time, Newsweek, and US News and World Report may stay in local doctors offices for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Share ad costs with neighbor business. Video stores and Pizza parlors are natural partners. Have coupons to each others stores or share the cost of flyers. Try reducing the size of your ad (not in the Yellow Pages) or length of your radio spots. A 60 second spot is not twice as much as a 30 second spot but you won’t get twice as many customers for a 60 over a 30. Going with small ads or shorter spots will allow you to do more ads which normally pulls more customers. It’s better to be there every day with small ads than every month with one big one. Develop tight production controls to minimize the need to reject finished ads. The message is more important than the messenger. Don’t try to produce ads that win awards, produce ads that sell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who are your very best customers? Aim your ads to talk directly to people like them What will suppliers give you in the way of point-of-purchase materials. Posters, stand ups, handouts, etc. Some have excellent display racks you can use.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some national chains like Coke and Pepsi provide outdoor signs for businesses. There are also indoor lighted signs you write on with special markers to advertise your special offers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you sponsor a community event? A fun-run, golf tournament, or other event that will be well publicized in the community. Your name may not be prominently displayed but sometimes the positive exposure in the community will bring in new customers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Small businesses can seldom afford saturation advertising. You must be selective in the media that reaches your customers. Pin your ad reps down and make them show you exactly how their media reaches your target audience.
           </p>
           <p>
            Exploit the media you choose to the fullest. If your message is verbal, you don’t need TV. Use radio, billboards and newspapers to the fullest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider direct mail. A letter and brochure before customer contact can increase business. An IBM study concluded that selling time can be reduced from 9.3 to 1.3 total hours with direct mail advertising. A Sales and Marketing Executives International Study showed salespeople went from eight orders per 100 cold calls to 38 orders per 100 when direct mail was used.
           </p>
           <p>
            Try an editorial style ad. These are ads that look like actual stories in the newspaper. They will have “advertisement” at the top of the article. Develop a good headline, and 50% more people will read the article than would read an ad of the same size.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can’t match larger competitors dollar-for-dollar but, you can use unusual approaches (like the Avis idea above), color, music, slogans, humor (be careful here), or media selection to win your market away from the big guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            Due to the high costs of conventional advertising on, radio, TV, newspapers, many cost conscious business have been forced to look for lower cost methods. Can you advertise on parking meters, taxi boards, balloons, blimps, and grocery shopping carts. Community bulletin boards, movie ads, and weekly newspaper shoppers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Key your ads. Put something in the ad that will let you know which media it came from. On coupons, put a code that will record the paper and date of the ad. In radio or TV, have them mention the ad to get the discount. Ask every customer how they found you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plan for a rainy day. During the year put a small amount aside each month for emergencies. You never know when you’ll need to react quickly to whatever the competition is doing. You must be able to capitalize on breaking national events or news regarding your industry. If negative things happen in your industry you may need to respond quickly to make sure the right message is presented.
           </p>
           <p>
            Always give the customer more than you promised and more than they expected. This is tip number 27 of the 25 we advertised. Maybe this last one is the one you needed.

            This concentration has conveyed numerous at each level to go up against a political mentality as a substantial approach to battle for the confidence. We see it in the compositions and hear it in the recordings/podcasts of religious pioneers around the nation. It’s not widespread, but rather there is a reasonable move in the lion’s share towards partaking in more political battlegrounds. This move accompanies dangers. In the event that individuals enable the political fights over religion to supplant the individual, familial, and social fights that should all be battled also, we will lose ground in the more imperative field for winning higher-profile triumphs in the political one.
           </p>
           <p>
            We’ve generally kept up that the partition of chapel and state is a basic obstruction to keep up. It’s not a dread of religion crawling into government. Our worry is that administration will have excessively impact over the congregation. Similarly as America’s organizers battled to keep up religious flexibilities that couldn’t be detracted from individuals by the administration, so too do we trust that the present conditions warrant a similar battle.
           </p>
           <p>
            The powers mounted against us would love to see the unwavering end up noticeably fascinated in political fights. The universe of governmental issues back and forth movements. Triumphs can be turned around rapidly and political slant is temporary. Simply take a gander at what occurred with Obamacare. This was an immense endeavor that took innumerable worker hours to make, a huge number of dollars to set up and “offer” to the American individuals explains Pastor Josh

            , and specifically influenced countless individuals in numerous ways. Presently, it’s very nearly being wiped from presence in under 10 years. That is governmental issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is this: fights battled for the confidence on the political front yield transitory outcomes. Saying this doesn’t imply that that they’re not critical or that we shouldn’t battle them, but rather it appears as though laws and government have turned into the point of convergence. This ought not be. Political arrangements are band-helps. On the off chance that we don’t win the social fights and move the mentalities of Americans, especially youthful Americans, to grasp a Biblical perspective, each political triumph will in the end be upset. Indeed, political triumphs are regularly utilized as arousing cries to electrify the resistance.

            Your business card is frequently a potential client’s initially contact with your organization; you need to connect with them and urge them to discover more about you and what you do. One of the most ideal approaches to do this, is with an all around composed, easy to comprehend card. Take after the tips underneath to make particular, proficient business cards that packs a punch!
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Who, What, Where, Why?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            1) It might sound self-evident, yet the first (and most vital!) thing to consider when outlining your business card is the data you need to pass on. Ensure your name, work title and organization name or logo are obviously shown. Contemplate which contact subtle elements to incorporate – you have to strike a harmony between sufficiently giving purposes of contact, without making your card look jumbled. From our experience, your site, email address and telephone number are basic. Numerous organizations never again incorporate an address on their business cards, so in case you’re battling for space, you might need to expel this from your outline.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Make it Readable
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            2) If you have a considerable measure of data to show, you might be enticed to contract the extent of your content. Be careful – little content can frequently look coherent onscreen, yet transform into a messy smear when printed. When in doubt of thumb, don’t go littler than 8pt. Likewise, remember about the textual style itself: keep it expert and basic – don’t be enticed to utilize Comic Sans, or a point by point calligraphic text style which is difficult to translate.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             QR Codes
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Another method for sparing space is to make a QR Code for your card. They give a slick method for including a considerable measure of data on a business card, without making it look jumbled. It’s likewise a simple approach to make a connection between your printed and online substance – by examining the code, individuals can consequently be sent to your site. There are a lot of free QR code generators on the web, so getting mechanical doesn’t need to use up every last cent.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Beautiful or Plain?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Bright hues – when utilized accurately – can make a a cheap

            emerge, and look unmistakable. This strategy is regularly utilized by outline and inventive organizations, with the point of seeming crisp, energizing and unique. Nonetheless, don’t think little of the energy of effortlessness. A plain high contrast configuration can be as essential and striking as a beautiful card – and can frequently be viewed as more “jazzy” as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Embellishing
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            5) If you’re worried about a highly contrasting card looking dull, have a go at emblazoning the words. Emblazoning makes a raised, 3D impact, which adds tastefulness and style to a business card.
           </p>
           <p>
            Embellishing likewise makes the card more material. Research with
            <a href="http://www.123printmeup.com">

            </a>
            printmeup has demonstrated that connecting with more than one sense at any given moment can enhance review of a protest, so individuals would probably recollect your business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shading Choice
           </p>
           <p>
            6) It’s savvy to keep your business cards in accordance with whatever remains of your organization’s marking. On the off chance that you have organization hues, utilize them. Obviously, in the event that you don’t have a specific shading plan to work with, you’ll have free rule on your cards. Be that as it may, be mindful so as to pick integral hues – conflicting hues can look cheap and amateurish on a business card. If all else fails, utilize an online shading coordinating device.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Visual Content
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            7) Pictures talk louder than words. This is valid for business cards. While you need composed substance on one side of the card, consider sparing the other for something more visual. Maybe you could utilize the space to show a picture of your item, or something identified with your business. Or, on the other hand, put your organization logo on the back of the card. Whatever you do, don’t abandon it clear – it’s regularly asserted that individuals don’t take a gander at the back of business cards, yet that is just not genuine. Simply consider how often you’ve been given a card, and flipped it over to check…
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Outskirts and Bleeds
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            8) Don’t utilize outskirts in your card plan. This is for an absolutely viable reason – regardless of how much consideration is paid, printing is never 100% totally exact. A flawlessly symmetrical verge on your screen may turn out disproportionate, on account of moment developments in the printing machine. Printers suggest leaving a 3mm Bleed – a territory an indistinguishable shading from the foundation – around the edges of your card, only therefore.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The Safe Area
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            9) Along with the drain, printers additionally typically indicate a “protected range” in the focal point of the card. Keep any essential data – like contact subtle elements – inside this territory, to maintain a strategic distance from it being cut off amid the printing procedure.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Paper Thickness
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            10) Consider the thickness of your business card. Thicker cards tend to feel more costly – making your business appear to be more expert. A business cards imprinted on paper more slender than 300gsm look and feel rather thin, which can make them feel tasteless and shoddy. Have a go at thinking about your card as you would a handshake – no one enjoys a limp handshake, so why might they like a limp business card?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Keep it Simple
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            11) You may be enticed to utilize a bizarre material for your business card. While this will absolutely be noteworthy, remember the reasonableness of your picked medium. Individuals regularly compose additional points of interest on business cards –, for example, where they secure the card. This is substantially more hard to do on metal, wood or even meat.

            The half-existence of promoting activity is zero. This implies the minute you quit spending money, the movement stops. The issue is that with run of the mill change rates of 1-2% you’re paying for 98 or 99 out of each 100 individuals to leave and never returned to your site. To battle this inborn inefficiency of publicizing, I have two key methodologies I suggest regardless of which strategy for promoting you utilize.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Methodology #1: Try to Get Permission
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Truly consider offering something in return for a guest’s email address. It can be a free trial, a free report, or perhaps a free book. Yet, picking up the methods and authorization to contact that client again will expand your change rate after some time by and large. There is extraordinary power in an email list.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Technique #2: Use Advertising to Test
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Utilize publicizing as a testing apparatus instead of a long haul stream of clients. Not very many new businesses can withstand the money cost required to transform promoting into an advertising movement with positive ROI. Regardless of the possibility that you make sense of it, promoting is an unpredictable advertising medium. Costs increment quickly in web based promoting as new rivalry manifests or prospects become exhausted of your advertisement and your active clicking factor drops. At the point when this happens, the greater part of the time you put resources into improving your advertisement crusade is *poof*…gone. So as opposed to depending on promotion movement as a continuous stream, utilize it for what it’s best at: the capacity to produce a large number of guests rapidly, and to be killed similarly as fast. This sort of movement source makes it incredible for split testing and client conduct testing utilizing apparatuses like Clicktale and Crazyegg. It likewise gives you knowledge into how certain movement changes over for you. With legitimately followed transformations and a promotion on Facebook, you can verify that men from 35-45 change over at a rate 15% lower than ladies of a similar age.

Frequently this is not the biggest market; it’s the one to whom you can advertise for the least cost.

This is madly profitable as you contribute the time and cash on the whole deal of site improvement. Knowing the watchwords that truly change over for your business, instead of the ones that you think will change over, can spare you heaps of money and numerous times of SEO exertion.

             The “Initial Five” Advertising Options
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In light of the above systems, how about we take a gander at the initial five promoting alternatives you ought to consider.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alternative #1: Niche Advertising
           </p>
           <p>
            As a startup, there are several general publicizing alternatives accessible, and thousands more specialty open doors. Contingent upon the specialty you’re taking into account you ought to have the capacity to discover a discussion, blog, magazine or site in which to spend some promotion dollars. The more tightly the specialty the better. Keep in mind that specialty destinations have a tendency to be less expensive to publicize on and drive more focused on movement, which has an immense effect in your change rate. (What’s more, in case you’re not focusing on a specialty since you need your crowd to be the “entire world,” will require significantly more than $300 in your advertisement spending plan). When all is said in done, on the off chance that you are advertising to a specialty you will know the locales to target. On the off chance that you don’t it’s a great opportunity to pound the asphalt and discover what they are. By “pound the asphalt” I mean pursuit on Google and contact individuals in the specialty to discover where they hang out on the web. Two legitimate specialty promotion systems I’ve worked with in the past are:
           </p>
           <p>
            InfluAds – With an expanding number of publicizing “groups” covering plan and UX, new companies and business visionaries, work and profitability and web improvement, InfluAds can work with spending plans as little as the $300-400 territory. They offer a base arrangement of allowed impressions, and if more activity is accessible amid a month at that point existing sponsors get it for nothing. Picture advertisements as it were.
           </p>
           <p>
            BuySellAds – Though they’ve generally centered around the outline and UX space, BuySellAds is spreading into numerous different specialties. This picture just promotion organize was the essential wellspring of activity for an outline situated site I possessed, and had the effect between a couple of hundred dollars every month in deals, and a couple of thousand. Promoting is obtained by impression or on a month to month premise from singular sponsors, which means each offers diverse estimating. In any case, the base purchase is extremely shoddy – in the $10-$20/month run.

            Smart, successful advertising requires more than talent. It requires discipline. You might have a very creative ad, but if doesn’t contain a clear message relevant to the target audience along with a call-to-action, it’s going to miss the mark. Or you might find yourself with a campaign that generates a lot of leads to the website, but very few convert to new accounts. Here are some solid guidelines to help ensure that you create campaigns that make the cash register ring.
           </p>
           <p class="subhead">
            <strong>
             1. Don’t be a follower.
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Too many advertisers get caught up in what their competitors are doing, assuming their competitors are smarter and in the know. That is rarely the case. If you want to be a success, carve out your own distinctive brand. Do your homework, know your strengths, understand your target audience, and make a brand promise that is relevant and meaningful. Most important, be unique. No one became a success by following everyone else.
           </p>
           <p class="subhead">
            <strong>
             2. Don’t overlook your website.
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Too many financial institutions focus their efforts on their ad campaigns, and ignore the fact that they have an outdated website. If your site needs an overhaul, don’t bother investing more in advertising until you fix it. In today’s world, even consumers who might choose you because they live nearby are likely to “check you out” online. If your website looks archaic, this could stop them dead on their tracks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Make sure your website is consistent with the brand you promote in your campaigns. It should have the same tagline, fonts, colors, message and brand personality. Ideally, it will be easy to navigate, explain your brand and products succinctly, and make it easy to apply for them. And don’t forget to regularly test your online application. Many financial institutions have invested money in online ad campaigns, only to lose prospective customers due to a complicated, time-consuming or broken online account opening process. Some even have links to dead online applications.
           </p>
           <p class="subhead">
            <strong>
             3. Don’t jump on every bandwagon that rolls by.
             <br/>
            </strong>
            The advertising world is changing constantly, and there’s always some new fad. But that doesn’t mean that every new thing that comes along makes sense for you. QR Codes are a great example. For a while, they were touted as the hottest thing to hit the advertising world. But how many QR codes have
            <em>
             you
            </em>
            actually clicked on? They’re helpful when you actually have compelling additional information or a big payoff, but they’re not for everything. Simply slapping a QR code on your marketing materials that does nothing more that point to your general homepage is not necessary or helpful, it’s just gimmicky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is Foursquare, a popular social tool that rewards visits to an advertiser’s

            You’ve taken the time to craft a thorough, well-organized, well-documented demand letter. You used every possible resource to make your claim as strong as it can be. So what happens when the insurance adjuster receives your letter, reads through it, and calls you to begin negotiating a settlement?

            Negotiating a personal injury settlement isn’t quite the same as haggling at a yard sale or bargaining with a car dealership salesperson. While some of the same negotiating techniques work, others fall flat in this context. Going into negotiations unprepared could mean leaving hundreds or thousands of dollars on the table. To get your insurance adjuster’s respect and full attention, you have to show that you know what you’re doing.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             1. Don’t Speak First
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The insurance adjuster will likely ask you – in more complex terminology, of course – how much you want. Most people without legal experience will blurt out a number. That’s exactly what the insurance adjuster wants you to do. From there, the adjuster will certainly negotiate down. Suddenly the number you were willing to accept is cut in half, and the adjuster is telling you that they really can’t go any higher. It’s this amount or nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            A little-known secret is that
            <a href="http://morenoandassociates.com">
             chula vista attorneys
            </a>
            like ours never want to be the first one to throw out a number. Just as you didn’t include a number in your demand package, don’t volunteer one to the adjuster, your opponent in the bargaining game. When asked, remind the adjuster that it’s his or her job to evaluate the case, and ask them what they think your claim is worth.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             2. Go into Negotiations with a Number in Mind
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember all that time you spent considering claim value? You might have been surprised that after calculating the value of your claim, and particularly your non-economic damages like pain and suffering, you never had the opportunity to include it in your demand letter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though the insurance company will only respect losses that you can document, the adjuster is a human being. He or she knows that you have non-economic losses, and that they warrant compensation, even though it’s in the insurance company’s best interests not to compensate you fully. The medical narrative you included in your demand letter painted a picture of how much pain and suffering you experienced. The adjuster got to see how many uncomfortable or downright painful medical tests and procedures you had to undergo and how long your injuries caused you substantial enough pain to require a doctor’s care. If you needed physical therapy, he or she was able to understand that your injuries impaired your physical abilities. Any prescription medications, like painkillers, illustrate the seriousness of your discomfort to the adjuster.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both you and the insurance adjuster know that the value of your claim exceeds the amount of your economic damages. That’s why it’s always helpful to go into negotiations with that complete claim value in mind. Your insurance adjuster will never offer you more money than you ask for, so keep your calculations in mind as you negotiate, and always start high.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suppose the insurance adjuster working on your claim won’t budge on the issue of naming a number first. You’re at a stalemate, and that’s not helping your case. If you wait too long and end up approaching the statute of limitations, you’ll have to file a lawsuit or end up with nothing. Lawsuits are so expensive to succeed in that you’d have to spend your personal money to handle one yourself, not to mention they’re so much more complicated than claims that you really do need a lawyer. (And if you’re too close to statute, no lawyer will want to take your case, anyway, because there simply won’t be adequate time to prepare.)
           </p>
           <p>
            If you do have to throw out a number first, think back to that claim value amount you calculated. Make sure you included every economic and non-economic loss when figuring out that number. Of course we’d all rather get more money than less money, but is the number you calculated something that you will realistically be happy with?
           </p>
           <p>
            If so, multiply it by two – or more. Then use this number to open the negotiations.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             3. Always Ask for More Than You Want
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A basic rule of all negotiations is to start higher (or lower) than the amount you really want to pay. Think about the process of buying a car. You are trying to get the best deal, so you start by naming a price lower than you really expect to have to pay. The salesperson counters with an offer higher than the price you named (and then he or she expects to get), but lower than any price he or she had previously stated. As you go back-and-forth, you approach a middle ground. The basic idea stays the same, but the roles shift slightly in the personal injury scenario. Instead of seeking the lowest-priced deal, you’re looking for the highest-value settlement.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             4. Adjust Your Haggling Strategy
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A major difference between your personal injury claim and a car sales situation is that your options are limited. If you don’t like a salesperson’s attitude or the deal they are trying to get you to accept, there is always another car dealership for you to visit. You’re not locked into doing business with this person, and he or she knows it – which might make the salesperson more willing to cooperate with you and negotiate fairly. In a personal injury claim, you don’t have such freedom. If your preferred bargaining strategy hinges on threatening to take your business elsewhere, this negotiation will force you out of your comfort zone.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             5. Never Reveal Your Bottom Line
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember when we said earlier that the insurance adjuster is your adversary? Now you finally get to see that relationship in action. If you’re naturally a very straight-to-the-point person who doesn’t like playing the game of negotiating, you may be tempted to tell the insurance adjuster simply, “this is my bottom line.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Don’t do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though you’re not in the same physical space, you and the insurance adjuster are on opposite sides of the bargaining table. Sure, the adjuster might seem like they feel the same way about the process. Just as he or she did at the start of your claim, the adjuster is again trying to gain your trust. If the adjuster didn’t like negotiating – or, more importantly, wasn’t good at doing it for the benefit of the insurance company – he or she would find a different line of work.
           </p>
           <p>
            So don’t let your guard down just because the insurance adjuster tells you that the company would like to resolve the claim as quickly as possible and that giving them your bottom-line number will speed up the process. It’s just one more trick. From your lowest acceptable number, the adjuster will continue negotiating down. It’s too late to change your mind and up the amount of money you’d accept. You’ve already given up your leverage.
