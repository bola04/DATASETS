     Kilcoy Kindergarten - Childcare and Nursery
    </h1>
    <p class="intro">
     Quality childcare and early education for your child.
    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose of Kilcoy Kindergarten is to assist parents with a childcare provision, which they may use, to enable them to continue to pursue their employment, interests, hobbies etc, in the knowledge that the care, safety and development of their child is not compromised. In turn, it is an opportunity for the children to mix with their peers and develop relationships. The Kindergarten is located over two premises in Kilcoy approximately half way between Inverness and Dingwall in The Highlands of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
     At Kilcoy Kindergarten we aim to provide security to all children and peace of mind to their parents. We support the children's development by ensuring a
     <strong>
      safe, stimulating and caring environment
     </strong>
     where they can play, grow and learn.
    </p>
    <p>
     We undertake to deliver the highest standard of childcare and education, in a most secure environment and

     Outdoor Play
    </h2>
    <p>
     We feel it is important that children spend a lot of time outside experiencing physical play. We have two outdoor decked areas where children can play under supervision in absolute safety. Different age groups are encouraged to play together with a wide range of outdoor toys and equipment. We also have our Forest Classroom and a large grassy area to run around.

    <h2>
     The Kindergarten
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Kindergarten has been developed especially for our 3 and 4 year olds. It is a bright lively environment where your child's social skills blossom with the help of our warm, friendly and qualified staff. The room has its own outdoor play area just off the main playroom allowing the children the choice of outside or inside play. We provide pre-school in partnership with the Highland Council. Here we follow the Curriculum for Excellence offering extended care for those parents and carers who work for more than 2.5 hours a day. The Kindergarten can accommodate up to thirty two 3 and 4 year olds with four full time members of staff.
