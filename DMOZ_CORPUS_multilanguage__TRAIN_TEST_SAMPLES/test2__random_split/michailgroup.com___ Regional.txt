                       Welcome to a new age in the travel / tourism and vacation industry. Customizable travel membership programs are designed where the client is the critical factor and not the people who try to dictate the industry. After years of being involved in the travel and vacation industry, we started to see that there are several major factors that are very important:
                      </p>
                      <ul class="coltxt_li">

                        <strong>
                         People love to travel
                        </strong>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        <strong>
                         People want value for their hard earned money
                        </strong>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        <strong>
                         People want first class service
                        </strong>

                      </ul>
                      <p class="coltxt">
                       With that being said, we also noticed that these needs are being overlooked. Sure, it’s a given that people love to travel, and yes all of the travel companies work on this as a hook. However, we also saw that under the current standards being portrayed to the consumer, perceived value vs. actual value in many cases are at opposite ends of the spectrum. This is one of the primary reasons we started to develop this program.
                      </p>
                      <p class="coltxt">
                       Based on our background and experience of being involved in the industry, we were able to:

                        <strong>
                         Evaluate the current method of programs available to the consumer
                        </strong>
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        <strong>
                         Define the critical requirements

                        <strong>
                         Address the critical requirements

                       The way that we were able to address the issue of critical requirements was in our ability to build and partner with vendors who are leaders in the industry as well as have a vision for development for the future. We have brought together a team of people and companies that look at things from the perspective of building and changing the industry.

                       Travel incentives are a great way for companies to promote   their business and increase sales by offering a free or drastically   discounted travel package to their customers. Typically travel   incentives are used as bonuses  to add extra value to a particular   product or service.

                       Although cash is still a viable incentive, the impression it leaves   on the individual who recieves it is limited. Imagine you recieved a   bonus of $500 for achieving the most sales on your team. Where does that   money go? In your pocket? Maybe the bank? Almost definitely it is going   to pay some bills. Do you see where this is going? As soon as the money   touches your fingers it is practically gone!

                       Now imagine a scenerio where instead of recieving $500 cash you   are presented with an MGi Escape Card that is good for 1 year.  You   decide to take a vacation to a beautiful 5 Star resort with your family.   With access to over 100,000 accommodations worldwide and prices as low   as $300 per week one could see that even one trip can double or even   triple the value of a cash incentive.
                      </p>
                      <p class="coltxt">
                       In addition to saving thousands of dollars, you and your family   will remember the experiences you shared together while on vacation.   And we all know that memories last a lifetime. When you return from   paradise you will be glad to know that you can book as many vacations as   you desire while your Escape Card is active.
