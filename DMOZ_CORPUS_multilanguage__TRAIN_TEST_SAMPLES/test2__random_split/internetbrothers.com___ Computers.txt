 						 encourage and motivate newcomers to this online passion. Take a stroll
 						 down memory lane as you learn what the web was like in those rough and

          You've heard of it, some of your friends do it, and you want
 								to try it. Digital cameras and photography; what's it all about?
 								It requires an investment; a new camera and memory for the camera;
 								a computer, if you don't already have one, or a better computer
 								if you have an old one; and software for editing your images,
 								although most digital cameras now come with minimal software.
         </p>
         <p>
          Getting into digital photography also requires a willingness
 								to learn new stuff. How does the camera work? How do the photos
 								compare to what I got with my old film camera? How do I print or
 								email the photos to show friends? How do I store my photos to show
 								the kids when they're grown up? Let's start with the basics.

          Digital Camera Techniques
         </h4>
         <p>
          Digital photography employs a camera just like film photography,
 								but instead of capturing the images to film, digital media stores
 								the photos for retrieval with a computer or for display on a
 								television set. Some digital cameras can be connected directly to
 								a printer device negating the need to view photos on screen. Some
 								printers and computers accept memory cards from your camera so the
 								pics can be printed or viewed without attaching the camera.
         </p>
         <p>
          Here, we provide a few pointers on what to expect from digital
 								cameras, photos, and why you should be interested. These are for
 								the novice or somewhat serious amateur photographer, not the
 								professionals out there who might use expensive digital camera
 								equipment and lighting. Shopping for digicams can be a daunting task.

         <h4>
          Seeking the Best Image Quality?
         </h4>
         <p>
          If you've been into photography for awhile, you know the
 								difference between single lens reflex (SLR) cameras and small
 								pocket-style cameras. SLRs offer a lot more flexibility. They
 								generally use better lenses, and you can attach a variety of
 								lens types from wide-angle to telephoto to zoom. They allow full
 								manual control of exposure and focus. When composing your photo,
 								you're looking right through the lens. These and other features
 								of SLRs allow you to be a more creative photographer, and you
 								might get better pictures.

         Exposure Bracketing with Your Camera

         <h4>
          Having Trouble with Lighting and Contrast?
         </h4>
         <p>
          The correct exposure is perhaps the most fundamentally important
 								aspect of taking a good photograph. It doesn`t matter how well a picture
 								is composed or how well it tells the story, if a photo is under or
 								over-exposed its value is lost. So learning to manage the exposure
 								compensation options on your digital camera shouldn't be bypassed. The
 								fact is it's very easy to do with exposure bracketing.

         <p>
          Tripods are great for taking long exposures and for getting steady
 								nature shots. Choosing a suitable tripod for your photographic needs
 								can be a tricky process. There are so many different brands on the
 								market and it is difficult to decide which is the right one for your
 								particular project. Different types of digital photography require
 								different equipment, and when it comes to selecting a tripod, there
 								are several factors to consider.

          So you've seen those cool QTVR movies on the web, and
 								you want to learn how it's done. Well, you've come to the right
 								place. Internet Brothers to the rescue again. We'll be talking
 								about creating panoramic movies here, the kind you can move from
 								side to side up to 360°, as if you're standing on the spot where
 								the panorama was captured, spinning around.
         </p>
         <p>
          The first thing you need to do is find a nice location. We've discovered
 								it works best if you're on top of a multi-directional vista, or
 								in the bottom of a valley or bowl. Think of a sine curve. But be
 								careful when you turn. We don't want you to start out at the top
 								and end up at the bottom. It's hard on your camera.

          Desktop Publishing: a term that makes professional graphic
 								artists and typographers cringe at the thought of lousy home made
 								amateur art work. The Internet Brothers believe that businesses
 								and individuals who need to create and produce printed materials,
 								whether they be promotional pieces or business forms, should consider
 								hiring graphics professionals. After all, a lot of training and
 								experience is required to design printed pieces that look appealing,
 								get the message across, and give a first-rate impression.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, with the advent of the personal computer, there has
 								been a proliferation of desktop publishing software enabling the
 								aspiring artist to create a wide variety of materials needed to

          Just as owning a propane torch doesn't necessarily qualify
 								you to do the plumbing in your house, having a computer and a
 								printer in the den doesn't mean you're ready to create a
 								professional-looking publication. The quality of your publication,
 								whether it is a newsletter, a brochure, a business card, or an
 								annual report, shapes the public's perception of your business
 								or organization. A professionally designed and printed publication
 								tells your potential clients that you know what you are doing.
 								A poorly produced publication indicates the opposite.

 								remain in place if appropriate to the content. The grid enables the designer to
 								organise and align content so that there is design consistency from page to page
 								and thus continuity throughout the publication.

          Good web design is much more than graphics, content, and
 								navigation. From a Desktop Publishing standpoint, it includes
 								the knowledge of average visitors' attention span and what
 								works in terms of layout, for an average page. Web visitors tend
 								to have a very short attention span, but if a subject interests
 								them, they'll be more likely to study the site. It then becomes the
 								responsibility of the designer to make the words aesthetically
 								appealing and easy to understand.

          Are you confused regarding the many "rules" for Desktop
 								Publishing, both on and off the web? If you want to excel in
 								the DTP field, you need a good mix of knowledge in typography,
 								grammar, design, paper, service bureaus, print shops, marketing,
 								and client needs.
         </p>
         <p>
          There's a new glossary to become familiar with. Do you know
 								what fonts are? Do you know how to use kerning, leading, and
 								tracking? What are ANSI characters and why do I need to know?
 								You need to establish a relationship with a reputable printing
 								pro. A highly professional printer is like a fine jewel; a box
 								of chocolates; a perfectly done steak smothered in mushrooms
 								nestled next to a baked potato drowning in chives, sour cream
 								and butter.

        What is it that makes the Internet so compelling to so many? Aside
 							from the obvious fun and entertainment, educational and business
 							opportunities, and show-offism; We think it boils down to a slogan
 							taken from the eighties. No fear! The playing field is level. Size
 							doesn't matter, really. Inhibitions and reservations are out the
 							window when that modem says "let's go." No hidden emotions,
 							just pure, most-times rational thought.
       </p>
       <p>
        Internet life is people with diseases and addictions, exposing
 							souls and sharing their recoveries. It's about overviews of history
 							warning future generations not to repeat the mistakes of their
 							predecessors. Sure there are a few kooks to throw us off guard, but
 							mostly the net is just us being ourselves without fear of reprisal.
 							How refreshing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Internet is people talking and sharing ideas. Our best and
 							brightest, wallflowers and flower children, the girl next door and
 							the doc who delivered your kids. It's about you and me. We are all
 							using our own cognizant voices, and we're listening too. We're
 							challenging the status quo and offering alternatives.
 							Collaboration on a global scale all tied together by that simplest
 							of cyber friendships, the hyperlink. Communication has never seen
 							anything like it. The whole world is right next door.
       </p>
       <p>
        This spirit of community will ultimately be the lasting legacy
 							of the first fifty years. Not the gazillionaires. Not the top-down
 							control freaks of guerilla commerce. Instead, it will be the
 							work-at-home moms, the redneck artists and poets, the shy nerds with
 							decades of expression to release. We're delighted to make your
 							acquaintance.
