         Trust Services,  S.A. can help provide that margin of prudence against unexpected events when  making your offshore financial plans.  An  independent trust company, we are firmly rooted in Panama without any  representation or offices outside the country, ensuring the insulation of our  client’s affairs.  Fiduciary assets for  administration should be at least in the six-figure range with our focus on the  management of your personal, rather than business, affairs.  We offer a limited service in respect of  commercial activities where foreign companies wish to conduct business in  Panama and need local tax, secretarial, banking, accounting and administrative  assistance.  After more than 35 years in  business in Panama we have become very familiar with the country and the  region, so offering an experienced guide for foreigners who find themselves in virgin  territory is an immense help.  “

         What clients are we looking for? The careful and the conservative is the short answer and this welcoming page has been designed accordingly. Reading all of it will provide you with the preliminary information you require. We are the British face of corporate and fiduciary services in Panama, displaying a level of craftsmanship with  solutions that reveal our expertise. We do not want a lot of clients, we want a lot of good clients. Good service means satisfied clients and good clients are the bedrock of our business.  For us it has been a tried and tested formula.

          Trust Services,  S.A. is an accredited trust company in Panama, as recorded in the Public  Registry of Panama.  In order to achieve  this status, it is necessary to undergo stringent, rigorous vetting  that is a demanding and costly process.  Still  today many countries, Switzerland and the United States, for example, do not  have a supervisory system for professional trustees which rivals the one to be found in Panama and which includes an average two-year cycle of extensive on-site inspections made  by the fiduciary department of the Superintendent of Banks.

          During 2017, Trust  Services, S.A. completed the task of streamlining its operations, by  establishing an independent Compliance desk, increasing staff numbers and  improving computer and control systems.   Despite the considerable time and costs involved, the exercise has been  well worth it  and the principal platform  upon which our business has been built, providing corporate and fiduciary advice  and management (particularly family succession planning and  legitimate asset protection), has been strengthened.

          Whatever your  choice of trust company in Panama, it will be prudent to ensure that it is an  accredited one, licensed to conduct local and international fiduciary  business in Panama. Besides the Public Register, you can also confirm our licensing status by visiting the website at https://www.superbancos.gob.pa/superbancos/documentos/fiduciarias/directorio/directorio.pdf of the Superintendency of Banks.

          Trust Services, S.A. is a licensed independent trust company which reached its 35th anniversary milestone in 2016, and although many changes have taken place in the offshore financial services industry during that time, the one constant for our clients has been our consistent standard of service. We do not accept commissions from any third parties and so any introductions we make are for the sole benefit of our clients. Any lawyers, bankers, investment institutions that we recommend, therefore, are given in your best interests. It's not what they can do for us, but what they can do for our client that counts. Reputation comes before remuneration and which we protect with zeal.  Professionals recognise that it is the crucial element of business.

          More important, however, than a great location is great service and so every independent trust company needs not only adequate financial, but intellectual, capital as well. A dedicated, trained and bilingual staff (with most senior staff having worked for the firm since the 1980s) has given our clients efficiency and continuity. The next generation of managers is already in place so that our clients need not have any concerns about the continuity of our representation. As a family business we understand the importance of managing wealth and attention to detail. Our auditors for more than twenty five years have been Deloitte.

          Despite popular belief, prompted by biased journalists with little expertise in many cases, and egged on by the offshore scandals during recent times, not all business has taxes as the raison d´être for going offshore. Very often, unique investment and business opportunities are available offshore where access to foreign markets, currency diversification and a broader selection base of, say, mutual funds are available. Centralising international wealth management under the control of specialists means that trust companies such as Trust Services, S.A., for example, are able to offer co-ordination of bank and investment accounts, administration, bookkeeping and liaison with other professional providers. And if Panamanian tax or accounting advice is needed, we can also provide that  in-house with qualified accountants on our staff.

          In many cases we serve as advisers (particularly in the case of foundations and trusts) offering solutions and designing structures that are architecturally sound. The firm provides similar fiduciary services to those offered in the British offshore centres, which makes us unique in Panama. We have been simplifying the complex for nearly 40 years and we offer a package, not just a product. We can, in turn, structure a corporation with bank and brokerage accounts, including  credit cards, which can be managed by a trust or foundation to complete your estate planning.

To quote John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic: "It's unwise to pay too much, but it's unwise to pay too little. When you pay too much, you lose a little money – that’s all. When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought is incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.” And he added: “There is hardly anything in the world which someone can’t make a little worse and sell a little cheaper – and people who consider price alone are this man’s lawful prey.”

          Panama is a bridge between two oceans. Trust Services, S.A. is a bridge between two objectives: successful planning and implementation of an offshore strategy. It is delivering the service that counts and you must look beyond the gloss and sheen so frequently encountered. Put us to the "e-mail efficiency test" - see how long it takes us to reply to your message and then make comparisons. You'll find it reassuring. Whether you choose Trust Services, S.A. or not be sure to do your research and avoid what we call the 7 Deadly Sins (enter our website and click on our Company icon). The advice is priceless.
