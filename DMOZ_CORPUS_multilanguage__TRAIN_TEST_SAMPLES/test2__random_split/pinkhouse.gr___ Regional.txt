       <br/>
       Pink House is a traditional beachside Corfu villa at Kalami bay in the north-east 
         coast of the island, comfortably sleeping up to six persons.
       <br/>
       It is situated
       <b>
        literally on the beachfront of Kalami bay
       </b>
       and less than 100 meters from 
         the nearest mini-market. A car is not necessary for those who don't want 
         to drive.
       <br/>
       Kalami has several taverns, bars, mini-markets and two travel agencies 
         for changing money, buying excursion tickets, renting cars and other tourist 
         services.
       <br/>
       The White House in Kalami, with its tavern, is the former home of Lawrence 
         Durrell who lived there with his wife from 1935 to 1939 and wrote Prospero's 
         Cell. More information and photos on this issue you may find in the

       Pink House is set at the front of the village in a unique position - right 
         on the center of the beach - surrounded by a garden with lemon and orange 
         trees at the rear of the house and various flowers and plants including 
         bougainvilleas, aromatic herbs, and roses in the front yard.
       <br/>
       Adjacent to a small and quite tavern, it has been lovingly restored using 
         traditional materials and local craftsmanship so as to retain the original 
         style of this impressive old building. The exterior walls are 80cm thick 
         in places, keeping the house cool in summertime and warm in the winter 
         months.
       <br/>
       There is a lovely terrace in the pink stone front of the villa with a 
         superb sea view. At the rear of the house there is a large shaded terrace 
         overlooking the backyard orchard. The shaded terrace is a typical Corfiot 
         "botzos", an ideal spot for outdoor lunching, dining and evening 
         relaxation.
