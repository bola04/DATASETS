               "I would like to personally thank London Expert Law Tutors for providing me with excellent service and a proper education in Law. I had a challenging time grasping the core areas of law for the GDL. After receiving intensive tutoring prior to my exams, I was able to properly revise on top of discovering a new appreciation for the law. (...) 
 The facilities and personal care for my academic well being were top notch. (...)
 Carolena is an excellent leader with years and years of knowledge in various areas of the law. Her teaching method is the key to succeeding in law school and developing legal skills that will carry well into one’s career. Her tutors are extremely knowledgeable and provided much needed revision techniques for exam prep. I will continue with tuition for the LPC. Many thanks!"

               "I went to London Expert Law Tutors in need of help having failed some LPC modules. My previous tutors were unable to notice and highlight exactly where I was going wrong and I was in need of some urgent advice. I was at that point lacking in confidence but, from my first session with my tutor, she was able to identify my weaknesses and strengths and structured our classes accordingly. The sessions went beyond preparing me for upcoming examinations. They taught me how to think like a lawyer. My tutor was always extremely patient and gave me the confidence to believe in my abilities (...) Above all my tutor was approachable yet firm, empathetic, organised and extremely reliable. I cannot recommend London Expert Law Tutors highly enough.

The BPTC pushes students to think like practitioners, to solve problems like lawyers and to work well in pressured, time constricted scenarios. My tutor pushed me every day to leave my academic mind for a legal one. (...) When results rolled in, I received an Outstanding in all of the subjects my tutor assisted with - Civil Litigation, Criminal Litigation and Professional Ethics.

However, it turned out to be an excellent decision. The one-to-one sessions allow you to gain a more holistic understanding of the practice of law and goes beyond the BPTC in preparing you for employment. Having scheduled sessions every week forces you to stay focused and my tutor's approach to the questions on the BPTC helped me not only pass on my first attempt but also achieve good results. I would recommend London Expert Law Tutors to BPTC students."

I was finding it very challenging to study alone and go through what seemed a never ending syllabus and she helped me understand what was really relevant, helping me focus on the most important areas for my exam.The facts turn the law! My tutor also did an amazing job in calming my nerves and really preparing me for the oral part of my exams. I strongly recommend LELTS for both phases of the QLTS and really wished I had learned about the programme earlier! I have recommended it to everyone that has asked me for advice on preparing for the MCTs and the OSCE."

She was able to pinpoint my weaknesses and carry out the remainder of the classes to focus and develop the legal analysis skills I was lacking to prepare me for my exam. She was always prepared for each class and was able to explain details to me very clearly.     
 I failed my first attempt as three exams and my tutor was able to determine where I was going wrong in answering the questions. It came down to exam technique and she was able to structure our classes together to focus on what the examiner wanted and how to think legally, as a professional. This has helped me become more articulate and be more aware of how I conduct myself when going through documents."
