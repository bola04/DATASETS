          STATE HIGHWAY 
       SHIELDS ARE CHANGING
         </font>
        </b>
       </p>
       <p align="center">
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
         On January 9, 
       2006, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation approved a change of the 
       state highway shield. All 
       state highways will be signed with the number on top of an outline of the 
       state of Oklahoma. The top part of the numbers will be placed over the 
       bottom 1/3 of the state outline. According to ODOT, shield replacement 
        
       started in late January and may be finished by the end of the year. This 
       new design replaces the current circle design (like seen 
       above in the picture of the week). Stay tuned to OKHighways for pictures 
       of the new highway shields when they are erected in the near future.

         Update June 7: As

          a checklist
         </a>

         Update May 17: By 
       the end of this week, I hope to post a checklist of state highway shields 
       that have been seen by others and reported to me and/or have been 
       photographed by me. It appears that new state highway shields have popped 
       up in southeast Oklahoma, and have also made it through much of the 
       Oklahoma City metro area.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p align="center">
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
         Update May 3: In 
       the past week, I have received e-mails about new state highway shields 
       along OK 9 near Interstate 35, along OK 74B near Goldsby, and along 
       Britton Rd. at OK 74. Just today, during the time I was at work, the OK 3 
       shields were replaced along Shields Blvd. in SE Oklahoma City at the 
       Interstate 240/U.S. 62/OK 3 junction. As of tonight, the OK 3 shields 
       along S. Western at Interstate 240/U.S. 62/OK 3 have not been replaced 
       yet. But it appears that much progress is being made. I just don't know 
       when I'll get outside of the OKC area again to see the new highway 
       shields!

         Update April 1: 
       During a trip along the U.S. 75 corridor on March 31, I spotted about 18 
       new state highway shields, mostly along OK 16 between U.S. 75 and OK 52. 
       Other new shields I saw were on OK 117, OK 56, and OK Loop 56. So it 
       appears that if you want to see any new state highway shields right now, 
       take a drive along U.S. 75 between Okmulgee and Tulsa, or OK 16 between 
       U.S. 75 and Muskogee, because that is where they are at right now. I did 
       photograph the new shields and the pictures will be on the respective 
       webpages soon.

         March 13: After a 
       March 8 trip through south-central Oklahoma (including Ardmore, Duncan, 
       and Davis), I still have yet to see any new state highway shields. 
       HOWEVER, today Travis Turner sent me an e-mail with three pictures of the 
       new state highway shields near Muskogee:
