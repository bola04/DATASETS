      The Open Web Design approach:
     </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Open communication:
     </strong>
     We build a collaborative relationship with our customers through the exchange of knowledge.  We explain web marketing and technology in lay-person's terms.
 
 Our customers know their business better than anyone and share their experience with us.
 
 The advantages of an open approach are:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      we concentrate our efforts on your business objectives
     </li>
     <li>
      your business can make well-informed technology related marketing decisions
     </li>
     <li>
      you get a good return on your marketing dollar
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Flexible working methods:
     </strong>
     Some customers want to leave all the 'techie' stuff to the experts.  Others want to be
 
 'hands on' updating and maintaining a website themselves.  Both scenarios are valid and appropriate for different businesses.  We can:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Design, build and maintain a website
     </li>
     <li>
      Design and build a website, put in a content management system and provide training and a manual so that you can maintain 
 
 your own website.
     </li>
     <li>
      We are open to most proposals, dividing responsibilities in a way that will suit everyone's needs.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Advice and planning:
     </strong>
     It is quite unusual to be able to deal with someone like Karen Walsh, who has such a broad set of technical, 
 design, marketing and business skills.  This means that projects achieve their aims, as they are well thought out and planned appropriately at each stage
 of development.

      Website development - The process of designing and building the pages, images, and interactivity of your website.
     </li>
     <li>
      Website hosting - Once your site has been made, the files need to be located on a computer with web serving software that is connected to the 
 
 internet 24/7.
     </li>
     <li>
      Internet marketing and search engine optimization - keeping your website visible on the internet.
