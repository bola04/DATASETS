       <br/>
       Clark has practiced in the Wilmington since graduating from North Carolina State Universitys School of Design 1986. Between 1986 and 1991 he interned in the offices of Ligon B. Flynn, Architects, in Wilmington, and John W. Thompson, Architects, in Southport. During this time Clark gained experience in complex design projects ranging from commercial re-habilitations to custom resort residential. He also developed business skills needed to venture into private practice.
 							In 1991 Clark began his private practice under the name J. Clark Hipp, Architect, PC. From the beginning Clark has focused on commercial and institutional projects. In 2001 Clark added a business partner, Rick Best, and renamed the firm HIPP + BEST Architects, PC. Clark has continued to focus on commercial and institutional projects. In 2007 he moved the practice to a newly rehabilitated structure at 228 N. Front St, an award winning project his firm designed. Recently the firm changed its name to Hipp Architecture &amp; Development, PC.
 							Clark's project experience covers a broad range of commercial projects. Working for various developers he has designed large multi-tenant retail facilities to multi-tenant speculative office structures. He has also completed specialized designs for end users including a compounding pharmacy, real estate offices, as well as offices for the local Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 							Over the years, Clark has also provided design services for the State of North Carolina. This includes small interior renovations at UNC Wilmington, major dormitory rehabilitations at UNC Pembroke and new physical plant facility structures at both Uuniversities. Along with these efforts, Clark has worked for many churches in and around Wilmington.
