     Introduction
    </a>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Welcome to RNAdraw! RNA structure prediction has in the past mainly been 
 		offered only on 'larger' computers due to the 16-bit memory restrictions 
 		implied by MS-DOS. With the Win32 API it is possible to port native 32-bit UNIX 
 		applications to Intel x86 compatible computers without implying any software 
 		based memory and calculation restrictions. Since Win32 is the base of Windows 
 		95, Windows NT and Windows 3.1/3.11 with Win32s, ported programs should be able 
 		to run on an average Windows machine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Most RNA structure prediction programs have previously had two restrictions:
   </p>
   <p>
    1. They are available only on 'larger' computers, such as SUN, SGI and IBM 
 		systems.
   </p>
   <p>
    2. They more or less lack a user-friendly interface.
   </p>
   <p>
    RNAdraw issues both these problems and offers RNA optimal structure / 
 			basepair-probability matrix / heat curve calculation on Intel x86 compatible 
 			computers, providing a consistent user interface with many possibilities to 
 			view, print, import/export and edit calculation results.

    <a name="wwwRnadrawSysReqInst">
     System Requirements and Installation
    </a>
   </h3>
   <p>
    To install and run RNAdraw on your system you will need the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    - An Intel x86 (or compatible) computer (386, 486, P5, P6 )
   </p>
   <p>
    - Windows 95, Windows NT or Window 3.1/3.11 with Win32s version 1.2 or later
   </p>
   <p>
    - Newer versions of Windows (Vista, 7, etc) should work fine with the alternative ZIP file above
   </p>
   <p>
    - at least 8Mb of RAM, the more the better
   </p>
   <p>
    - 500 Kb free disk space
   </p>
   <p>
    (Win32s is a subset of the Win32 API for Windows 3.1/3.11 available free from 
 		Microsoft or with RNAdraw.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Memory requirements depend on sequence length and calculation type:
   </p>
   <pre>
  
 
 seq. size    calc. structure    calc. matrix
 
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
    250            390 Kb            650 Kb
 
    500           1530 Kb           2540 Kb
 
    750           3410 Kb           5690 Kb
 
   1000           6100 Kb          10100 Kb
 
   1250           9440 Kb          15730 Kb
 
   1500          13570 Kb          22620 Kb
 
 </pre>
   <p>
    As you can see, if you have 16 Mb of RAM, you can do up to 1000 bases easily 
 			(remember, the operating system wants some memory too..). On the other hand, if 
 			you lack sufficient memory for you calculations, you can do your calculations 
 			with Rnafold / GCG MFOLD / mfold on a UNIX machine and
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawImpExp">
     import
    </a>
    the results into RNAdraw.
   </p>
   <p>
    Currently there is no installation program for RNAdraw, you will have to 
 			install RNAdraw manually as described in the "install.txt" file included with 
 			RNAdraw.

    The sequence window ('RNA Sequences') is the 'control center' of RNAdraw. Here 
 			you see open files and their contents, such as structures and sequences. 
 			Double-clicking on an entry opens the corresponding edit window. As you can see

    important concept in RNAdraw is right-button menus.
    <i>
     All
    </i>
    windows have an associated right-button menu, so does every entry in the 
 		sequence list. These menus all contain associated data manipulating functions 
 		(more on these below!).
   </p>
   <p>
    RNAdraw supports 'drag-and-drop'; you can drag a .dra file from the File 
 		Manager/Explorer onto the main window and the file will be opened and added to 
 		the sequence list.

     Structure Calculation

   </h3>
   <p>
    The 'Calculate Structure(s)' menu option is available on the right-button menu 
 			of the sequence entry in the sequence list window. The minimum energy structure 
 			prediction algorithm in RNAdraw was ported from the Rnafold program included in 
 			the Vienna RNA package
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (1)
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    This dynamic programming algorithm is based on the work of M. Zuker and P. 
 			Stiegler
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (2)
    </a>
    and uses energy parameters 
 			taken from Turner
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (3)
    </a>
    , Freier
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (4)
    </a>
    and Jaeger
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (5)
    </a>
    . You can set 
 			multiple temperatures/temperature ranges for structure calculation, easily 
 			enter base-pairing constraints and set other calculation flags. The coordinates 
 			for the returned minimum energy structure are calculated with another ported 
 			program; Naview by R. Bruccoleri
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (6)
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Via a toolbar button or main menu option it is possible to modify/save/load all 
 		energy parameters used by the calculational algorithms in RNAdraw. In this way 
 		one can introduce new experimenatlly derived energies, rule out certain 
 		substructural motifs and monitor the effects of energy parameter changes on 
 		subsequently calculated structures.
   </p>
   <p>
    Under Windows 95 and Windows NT, calculations can be done minimized in the 
 			background.

    Above you see two structures in their edit windows. As you can see, you can 
 		adjust which information that will be shown, such as bases, labels, basepairs 
 		etc. You can easily zoom, pan and rotate the viewed structure by pressing the 
 		mouse buttons in different parts of the window, the mouse cursor changes 
 		appropriately to give you some notion of what is going to happen.
   </p>
   <p>
    The associated right-button menu includes several manipulation functions. For 
 		example, 'Mark Bases' lets you search for and mark sequence tokens in numerous 
 		ways, as you can see in the bottom window where 'UUUU' was used as a token. 
 		'Adjust Basepairs' allows the pairing / unpairing of individual basepairs to 
 		let you inspect structure / energy changes in different conformations.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is possible to apply basepair probabilities to the structure view, resulting 
 		in thicker lines for higher probabilities, as you can see above.
   </p>
   <p>
    All structure views can be printed on most Windows printers be exported as 
 			Windows bitmap (.bmp) or metafiles (.wmf/.emf).

    ) or on its

    Above to the right you see the basepair-probability matrix of the 37C structure 
 		of the 'Random RNA'. This window can be opened from the 'Open Matrix' menu 
 		option, which is available on the structure view / structure entry right-button 
 		menu. The top right triangle shows the probability matrix, the bottom left 
 		triangle shows the minimum energy structure. As you can see, the probabilities 
 		are grayscale-coded (higher probability = darker gray). Is possible to zoom up 
 		and pan around with the scrollbars, show alignment lines etc.. Moving with the 
 		mouse over the matrix displays the base-pairing probabilities of the underlying 
 		base-pair, as you can see in the status bar.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can manually pair/unpair basepairs in the structure by clicking with the 
 		left mouse button on a possible basepair in the lower left triangle. If you 
 		have the corresponding structure window open, you can directly monitor 
 		structure changes resluting from your basepair edits.
   </p>
   <p>
    From the right-button menu of the matrix window you can open the matrix 
 		probability histogram window, which you see above on the bottom left. Here, you 
 		can see the probability frequency distribution of the matrix, print it if you 
 		want to, and set a cutoff frequency for which probabilities are shown in the 
 		matrix.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is possible to 'extract' structures from the probability matrix, applying 
 		the current cutoff frequency. This allows you to view structures of certain 
 		'probability levels', and compare them with thermodynamically optimal 
 		structures.

   <p>
    <img src="images/rnadraw6.gif"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    Above you see a Heat window. This window can be opened from the 'Show Heat' 
 		option, which is available on the sequence entry right-button menu. The scroll 
 		bar at the bottom of the window lets you move the above blue marker back and 
 		forth to see individual heat at specific temperatures in the status bar (as 
 		above).
   </p>
   <p>
    You can print and export the window contents just as with the
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawStructureView">
     structure
    </a>
    and
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawMatrixView">

    windows.

     Import/Export functions

   </h3>
   <p>
    The following file formats can be imported into RNAdraw:
   </p>
   <p>
    - Ms-DOS / UNIX text files into the notepad / sequence editor
   </p>
   <p>
    - Any RNA text sequences can be pasted from the clipboard into the sequence 
 		editor.
   </p>
   <p>
    - GENbank data files can be imported. The whole file will be inserted into the 
 		notepad, the sequence title will be parsed out and the sequence will be 
 		inserted into the sequence editor.
   </p>
   <p>
    - Rnafold
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (1)
    </a>
    output files can be used to create new sequence files since they both contain 
 		sequence and structure data. This allows you to do larger calculations on 
 		bigger machines and edit/view them on your PC.
   </p>
   <p>
    - Rnafold
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (1)
    </a>
    output files can also be merged with existing sequence files given that both 
 		files designate the same RNA sequence.
   </p>
   <p>
    - Mulfold .ct files can be imported/merged in the same manner as Rnafold output 
 		files.
   </p>
   <p>
    - GCG PlotFold -H files containing multiple structures can be imported into 
 		RNAdraw. Each structure will be in its own structure entry in the sequence list
   </p>
   <p>
    The following data can be exported from RNAdraw:
   </p>
   <p>
    - notepad info and sequences can be exported as Ms-DOS text files
   </p>
   <p>
    - sequences can be exported as text files or copied to the clipboard
   </p>
   <p>
    - all structure/matrix/heat windows can be printed and exported as:
   </p>
   <p>
    1) Windows bitmap (.bmp) files
   </p>
   <p>
    2) Windows standard / placeable / enhanced (not Win32s) metafiles

     Calculation performance
    </a>
   </h3>
   <p>
    This has been, next to memory requirements, one of the main arguments against 
 			RNA structure prediction on the PC. Nowadays, 486 and especially Pentium 
 			machines deliver lots of calculation power, comparable to the capacity of IBM 
 			AS6000 systems. See the below table for some comparative results. The times 
 			shown are structure calculation/matrix calculation times in seconds.
   </p>

             (      RNAdraw      )            (    Rnafold    )
 
   size     486-66DX2     Pentium-90     AS 6000     SUN SPARC 10 (Dual proc.)

 (results will vary between different machines)
 
 </pre>
   <p>
    As you can see, it doesn't take all to long time for smaller sequences on a 
 		486-66DX2 computer, and surprisingly enough, a Pentium-90 outperforms even a 
 		SUN on structure calculation (remember though that this could well be due to 
 		better compiler output, not just processor horsepower).
   </p>
   <p>
    The implemented version of NAVIEW
    <a href="#wwwRnadrawReferences">
     (6)
    </a>
    is 
 			extremly fast; the structure coordinates for a structure with 7250 bases are 
 			calculated within 4 seconds (!) on a 486-66DX2 computer.

   <p>
    I've got lots of plans for RNAdraw, but remember; if nobody seems to be using 
 		the program, I wont do much work on it. You don't have to register to encourage 
 		me, just send me a nice and constructive E-mail and I'll do what I can.
   </p>
   <p>
    Planned calculation enhancements:
   </p>
   <p>
    - multiple structure comparison, using both regional and local algorithms
   </p>
   <p>
    - calculation of suboptimal structures using an improved prediction algorithm
   </p>
   <p>
    Planned technical enhancements:
   </p>
   <p>
    - Extended structure coordinate editing
   </p>
   <p>
    - Modularity : The ability to plug in external algorithms into RNAdraw
   </p>
   <p>
    - OLE 2.0 support
   </p>
