          What is it?
         </h3>
         <p>
          Our top pick among the best cell phone spying apps on the market is mSpy, the mobile tracking application which ticks all of the right boxes, and provides a cutting edge solution for spying on iPhones. mSpy offers a safe and reliable monitoring software, along with prompt and responsive customer care to provide an all-round monitoring experience.
         </p>
         <p>
          Further, mSpy is an extremely user friendly spying application, and you can even seek assistance for the installation process from mSpy’s live chat service. After installation you can immediately access all the data on the target device through the revolutionary Control Panel, which operates as a personal control board that allows you to view all the accumulated data in comprehensive reports.
         </p>
         <p>
          Below we’ve compiled a list of the cutting edge features offered in the premium version of the mSpy app.
         </p>
         <h3>
          mSpy Features
         </h3>
         <p>
          The app has been designed for parents to monitor the cell phone usage of their children, with a versatile set of features such as phone call monitoring on the target device, location tracking, access to text messages and multimedia files, in addition to being able to monitor instant messaging apps like WhatsApp on the device.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           1. Manage calls
          </strong>
          – mSpy’s call tracking feature allows you to make sure your children are not talking to the wrong people. The app maintains a chronological record of all the incoming and outgoing calls from the target iPhone with time stamps and contact information, which you can later review from the Control Panel.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           2. Location tracking
          </strong>
          – You can’t hover around your children the entire day, but it’s still important for you to know where they are, and more importantly if they’re safe. mSpy’s accurate GPS tracker allows you to view the current location of the target device, along with the detailed route history of the device over a period of time. All this information can be conveniently viewed from mSpy’s Control Panel.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           3. Instant message monitoring
          </strong>

          What is it?
         </h3>
         <p>
          At number 5 on our list of the hottest spying software for cell phones we have The TruthSpy, the covert and undetectable cell phone monitoring software that has been designed to cater to the monitoring needs of parents, couples and employers.
         </p>
         <p>
          To cater to such diverse audiences, The TruthSpy comes with an incredible range of features that allow you to remain undercover, and remotely gather huge amounts of information from the target device, all in real time. The software is particularly well known for its ability to monitor WhatsApp messages on Android devices, without the need for the device to be rooted. Here you can read more about the incredible features offered in The TruthSpy’s Gold plan.
         </p>
         <h3>
          TruthSpy Features
         </h3>
         <p>
          The TruthSpy comes with several unique features that will take your tracking experience to the next level, right from the comfort of your home.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           1. Restrict internet usage
          </strong>
          – In a unique and incredible feat of innovation, The TruthSpy makes it easy for you to restrict the internet usage of your children and employees if you feel that they are visiting inappropriate websites, or if they are spending too much time on social networking websites.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           2. Receive alerts
          </strong>
          – Monitoring a device can be a time consuming and often dull experience, but with TruthSpy’s alert feature you can now receive a text message to know whenever the activity that you wish to monitor is being done on the target phone. Accordingly, you’re saved the hassle of logging into the Control Panel repeatedly, and can start monitoring the moment you receive the alert about the particular task.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           3. Record surrounding sounds
          </strong>
          – Remotely switch on the microphone of the monitored device to listen in on what is being said or done around the device. Further, you can even fix the time at which you wish to activate the microphone and record the surrounding sounds, which can later be accessed by you from the Control Panel.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           4. Monitor calls
          </strong>
          – TruthSpy enables you to seamlessly monitor all incoming and outgoing calls on the target device, with detailed reports about the date and time of such calls, along with getting access to the audio recordings of all calls. In addition, TruthSpy comes with a unique feature that allows you to set an alert for when the target device receives a call from a particular number, upon which you will receive a notification.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           5. Access multimedia files
          </strong>
          – Keep a tab on all the photos and videos that are being stored on the target device, to ensure that nothing confidential is being shared by company employees, and that your children are not accessing objectionable content on the internet.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           6. Monitor instant messengers
          </strong>
          – With TruthSpy you can read all the messages that are sent and received on instant messaging services like WhatsApp and Facebook, along with detailed time stamps with each message. Further, you will also get to see all the photos, videos and audio records that are exchanged using these instant messaging services.
         </p>
         <h3>
          Pricing
         </h3>
         <p>
          The TruthSpy is available for purchase in three subscription plans, starting with the Standard plan that is available for just $21.99 per month, and gives you several interesting features but leaves out instant messaging access, multimedia access, and does not allow you to record calls on the target device.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you wish to have access to some, but not all, of the cutting edge features then try the Premium plan for $25.99 per month. However if you’re willing to spend just a little bit more you’ll get access to the entire suite of features provided by TruthSpy for just $31.99 per month. All three subscription plans come with a 5 day money back guarantee, that allows you to claim a refund if you’re dissatisfied with the product.
