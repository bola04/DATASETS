       The Company of the Wolfe Argent is dedicated to portraying the members of
 
   the Second Chambre of the Third Escadre of the Tenth Company of the Ordonnances
 
   of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, their families, and the support personnel
 
   of the company. The company is known and represented by its violet standard
 
   with St. Julian the Hospitallar at the hoist.
       <sup>

       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       The company was originally raised in the Summer of 1471 by Baudouin de Lannoy, lord of Solre and Molenbaix from the county of Hainault. Baudouin died sometime in the late Fall to Early winter of 1474, at which time
 
         Jaques Galliot (
       <em>
        Jacobo Galetto
       </em>
       ) was given command from that
 
         time until January 1476. Jean de Rubempré was
 
         the last commander of the Tenth Company of the Ordonnances from January1476
 
       until the battle of Nancy in January 1477.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wolfe Argent covers the full length
 
           of the existence of the first Bandes de Ordonnance, but for in-depth
 
           interpretation and the purpose of detailed histories of the members
 
           we concentrate on the events surrounding the siege of Neuss (1474 -
 
           1475) for interpretive scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wolfe Argent refers to the livery
 
           badge of the chef de chambre, Stephen Philpot (a fictional construct
 
           for the purpose of interpretation based on careers of actual English
 
           officers in Burgundian service) that is worn in addition to Burgundian
 
           livery by his personal retainers that formed the core of the original
 
           chambre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wolfe Argent does both professional
 
           historic interpretation - regularly as volunteer staff at the
 
         Armory and Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts, and occasionally at
 
         other institutions (University of Albany, April 2001), in addition to
 
         more traditional reenactment activities.
