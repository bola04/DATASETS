          These four are the absolute worst lighting conditions for applying your makeup:
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Fluorescent Lighting:
          </strong>
          For obvious reasons. It’s not just you. No one, and we mean no one, looks good in fluorescent lighting. Cool, fluorescent white light is unforgiving and overly bright. This unflattering lighting can cause you to overdo it with the foundation, bronzer, or blush in attempts to compensate for the lack of color on your face.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Yellow Light:
          </strong>
          Yellow light can make you look tired and sick, which may cause you to go overboard on the powder and concealer in efforts to neutralize your face and hide dark spots.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Rosy Light:
          </strong>
          Rosy light can make complexions appear healthy and vibrant, which sounds great, but it’s all a lie. Due to our radiant appearance in this lighting, we tend to slack on the concealer, only to later realize that we missed a blaring blemish or dark spot.

          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Downlighting:
          </strong>
          Remember when you were a kid and used to hold a flashlight under your chin to look scary? Well this is the same thing, but in reverse. Downlighting shines down on wrinkles and pigmentation and casts shadows under the eyes, making you look instantly older.
         </p>
         <p>
          Use natural light whenever possible. Natural light is the cheapest and easiest way to get the best lighting for makeup application. If you can, place your vanity stand or mirror close to a window that will allow plenty of natural light to give your face an even, pure wash of illumination. Even though natural light is one of the most unforgiving forms of light in terms of being able to see every imperfection, at least you will know exactly what you’re trying to detract from or enhance.

          Cross illumination is key in bathrooms.
         </p>
         <p>
          Referred to as side lighting, picture a pair of fixtures ideally mounted 36 inches apart and 18 inches from the centerline of the sink, says architectural lighting designer Randall Whitehead. Look for sconces, pendants or mirrors with backlit sections of frosted glass. The most luminous part should be mounted at eye level—about 5’6” off the floor—and if two people sharing the mirror have a height difference, a good solution is a long vertical design. Adding a center ceiling piece will complement the vanity lighting. Beware of lights fixed only above the mirror which illuminates your forehead and makes you tilt your head too far up to apply makeup with precision, warns Whitehead.

          It’s an age-old question: Why does department store makeup lighting suck so badly? Whitehead says the light in store mirrors is usually halogen, which isn’t the color of normal incandescent light nor the color of natural light, so when you get the makeup home, it looks totally different. The solution? Shop during the day and take a hand mirror with you. Try on the makeup shade and go take a look in natural light before you decide to buy, lest that lipgloss or shadow pot end up in the beauty product graveyard under your sink. More at

          Each one of these pianos brings a different set of features and styles to the consumer, and the final purchase all depends on what the consumer is looking for. The digital piano may be able to offer more portability and a higher selection of voices. Another may be able to offer affordability but a lower range of selection and quality. Other pianos may rely on the quality of the technology and hardware combined with the quality of the tone to present the overall package. No matter what the case each piano has its own characteristics.

           The P-105B
          </a>
          has been one of Yamaha’s bestselling digital pianos for years. It is most commonly seen as the best pound-for-pound package Yamaha has to offer as far as electronic pianos are concerned. The piano has a full range of 88 weighted keys, with amazing 128-note polyphony to ensure any kind of piano piece can be played. The keybed features Yamaha’s Graded Hammer technology, which replicates the hammer action found on a real piano, along with the graded touch and feel of the keys along the bass to the treble. There is also its Pure CF sound engine, which brings the pure sampled sound of Yamaha’s own CFIIIS concert grand piano as a first to the P-series. The build, style, and connectivity features top off the characteristics of the P-105B, but the price range of $600-$700 is the icing on top of the cake.

          Yamaha is known for making actual acoustic pianos. They have been building world class pianos for over a century. In the same breath they have some of the best piano sounds found in a digital piano. They sample sounds from top-of-the-line concert grands for many of their digital pianos.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another great reason to buy one of these digital pianos is their portability. They are relatively light and great for gigging.

           Popular Yamaha Digital Piano Models
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Yamaha produces a wide variety of leading Clavinovas, ranging from the entry level NP30 stand-alone digital keyboard to the advanced Yamaha P250 upright digital console. Leading models on the market today also include the P80, P90, P120 and the best-selling YDP 223 model. Higher end models include quality piano benches, well crafted wooden consoles and advanced electronic features include playback and sound effects. At the base level, the entry Yamaha NP30 Portable Grand Piano allows musicians with an existing stand and bench to buy an 88-key weighted action platform. Capturing the basic elements of polyphonic sound, the keyboard accurately reproduces the quality of the notes, although it lacks the advanced playback, sound effects, pedals and recording features of more advanced Yamaha models. Basic stand-alone keyboard models start at $299 and increase in price based upon the addition of more sound electronics.

          Taking a step up to the Yamaha Arius digital piano series offers a basic console frame, independent triple pedals and a music stand that allows for accurate practicing. While the basic Arius pianos are capable of basic electronic features, their cabinetry and recording functions are somewhat limited, making them ideal for home practice use. Adding a console frame brings the base price on the pianos to $799 and above, making the models a complete investment to enhance your home environment. For those looking to invest in a full living room or music school piano, the full Yamaha YDP digital piano series brings full-quality wood-grain designs and advanced features such as integrated sampling.

There are digital pianos that are more suited for the beginning piano player, and there are those that are geared toward the more advanced and elite players. However, regardless of what instrument is chosen the consumer should never feel as if they are overwhelmed by a machine or underwhelmed by it. Each piano has its own transient ability to cater to the needs of any piano player, but some pianos suit certain players more than others.

          A beginner digital piano tends to focus more on simplicity and quality rather than massive selection of features and fancy characteristics. Some of the Yamaha pianos that would fit under this category include the NP-11, NP-31, and the YPT-230. The NP-11 and NP-31 are brothers in the same family, with the NP-11 being a mini version of the NP-31. They both emphasize portability and affordability, with a nice set of keys and good polyphony. The YPT-230 has a much larger range of sounds, but comes with the same kind of portability and affordability.
         </p>
         <p>
          More advanced pianos offer a much wider range of options. Yamaha pianos in this category would be the DGX-640, P-155, YDP-V240, and the Motif XF8. The DGX-640 and the P-155 both emphasize quality tones embodied in a contemporary digital piano frame, with hammer action and wave sampling technology. The YDP-V240 brings all of that and more to the frame of an upright piano and the Yamaha Motif XF8 opens up a whole new world of studio production.
         </p>
         <p>
          Although this digital piano is in the top price range bracket, you get value for money with the quality of sound. This will definitely suit serious piano players who want the feel and sound of a top-quality digital piano. More at

          You’ve probably seen them before, those tiny little lights with the brilliant clarity. LED lights have gone from being an expensive novelty to becoming a legitimate contender in the home lighting arena.

          Plenty of LED desk lamps are either in the prototype stage or newly available for sale. This one, by a company called Satechi, is a high-quality, versatile product at a fair price ($100). It includes innovative features we haven’t seen anywhere else. Let’s take a close look.

         <p>
          If you’re going LED, you might as well go for all the bells and whistles while you’re at it. It’s nice when those extra features don’t cost a lot. This LED desk and reading lamp by Satechi is a wonderful example of a feature rich light with a very reasonable price tag.
         </p>
         <p>
          First off, the light is gorgeous. It’s very sleek and the modern gloss finish is right at home in a high end home or office space. It’s available in modern black or white.
         </p>
         <p>
          It’s also extremely adjustable. You can rotate the base of the light up to 130 degrees, and there are two pivot points along the length as well. You can basically adjust the light positioning to any point you need it. It’s really compact and unobtrusive as it is, but if you really want it out of the way, it folds almost flat.
         </p>
         <p>
          The light quality is the prime selling point for me. There are four ‘modes’ that you can choose between that alter how the light is displayed (one of the advantages of LED bulbs is the ability to dim or change the warmth and color). The higher intensity ‘study mode’ promotes concentration and energy, while the lowest ‘sleep mode’ is a lovely soft light with zero strain.
         </p>
         <p>
          It comes with convenient touch controls, and you can even use the USB port to charge your devices. And because it’s an LED fixture, it will last for over 40,000 hours of steady use; that’s over 20 years!

          The Softech Natural Light LED desk lamp is really a brilliant design because it’s been specifically designed for typical life uses. The visible light spectrum actually changes depending on each setting, not just the brightness. The reading setting, for example, places it at a mid range spectrum that isn’t too straining on the eye, but still provides great light quality. It also has an auto timer to shut off after a certain amount of time, so it’s really good for bedtime reading. It uses a tiny 10 watts of power, and the bulb will last for up to 20 years of use. That’ll save you some money on bulbs!

          This second product of LED table lamp is this black shiny one, with its 4 lighting modes which are for reading, study, relax, or sleep to make it easier for you to choose which mode is perfect for your situation. It gives a natural light to protect your eyes, not too bright and it an hour auto off. This LED table lamp is the best recommendation for a crafters or someone who sews, it does a good job for an art work.

          A slightly different take in terms of style and design, this LED lamp for desk or office use is beautiful, functional and incredibly slick. What’s more, the light quality is extremely good and will promote workflow all day with virtually no eye strain.
         </p>
         <p>
          The design is perfect for the modern office: minimal, sleek and refined. It takes up very little space on your desk, and it’s also ‘visually compact’, meaning that it won’t contribute to a cluttered feel in your workspace.
         </p>
         <p>
          The light design is great and throws a lot, and it folds vertically to give you a lot of control over where the light is cast. As for quality, there is a built-in glare filter that keeps the spectrum at the perfect level for human eyes. You’ll notice the lack of eye strain over the course of a day.
         </p>
         <p>
          You can control the brightness by touching the control at the base of the light stick, and this incremental control is one of the reasons this is in my top three. It uses a fraction of the energy that a conventional incandescent bulb would, and the whole unit is rated to last for around 25 years of steady use. It has a 3-year warranty against defect.

          Definitely among the best LED desk lights here, perfect for reading or office use, highly recommended. More at

          As recommended to me by Jessica Green (see comments below), I checked out the Lightblad by Lumiy. It’s a wonderfully designed light with a huge output: 1100 ‘lux’ provides a ton of illumination, and the light quality itself is ideal. It’s very easy to read and work by, and there’s little eye strain involved.
         </p>
         <p>
          There’s a capacitive ‘touch’ sensor (like on your smartphone) on the light’s base that allows you to adjust the brightness and the ‘color temperature’ of the light (meaning warm or cool tones). This leaves the lines of the light itself very sleek, modern and clean. I also love how low profile and sleek the light fixture (or ‘blade’) itself is. It doesn’t take up much space on the desk, yet provides awesome light quality. Definitely one of the better

         </p>
         <p>
          What’s so great about LEDs, anyway? Their most attractive attribute: energy savings. This 11-Watt LED desk lamp can give you as much light as a 75-Watt incandescent light bulb. That lets you illuminate your desk or nightstand for about 1/7th the energy you’re probably using now. And since the 27 LEDs in this lamp each last more than 40,000 hours, it’s likely you won’t ever need to change them.

          Students are often on a tight budget and think simply when it comes to decor. However, a table lamp is what they should be using to burn the midnight oil so to speak when it comes to studying for those exams. Even if they’re not thinking about getting a good lamp, you should add it to the list. Perhaps you’re getting all the things your son or daughter needs for a dorm room setup. Either way, getting that lamp reminds them that they need to study. More at

          Many desk lamps out there, however, aren’t too powerful. A weaker lamp might not provide enough light, and that’s not what you want. Technology has progressed enough to where you will get a powerful yet small desk lamp if you choose the right type of light source. It’s a great thing that reviews left by customers can tell you if a lamp really lives up to its expectations.More at

          It’s one thing for a company to say its lamp is going to be small yet powerful. It has to be proven though, as the last thing you want is to find out you should have purchased a better lamp. For a

          Messenger bags are also great for both men and women to carry since they are generally unisex in style. This can be good for couples who want to share a diaper bag but both want to look stylish. More at

           bags
          </a>
          , think about how large you want the bag to be. It should be big enough to hold diapers, baby wipes, bottles, small toys, your cell phone, and countless other items. At the same time, however, it should be small enough that you can easily carry it with you without feeling overly burdened.
         </p>
         <p>
          You should also pay attention to the number of interior pockets and the configuration of those pockets. They should be easy to access and should be laid out in such a way that you can keep all of your items neatly organized inside the bag. That way, you will know where everything is when you need it. The last thing that you want is to have to spend a lot of time digging around in the bag searching for something when your baby is crying or in need of care. More at

          Finally, consider the overall quality of the bag. If you invest in a high-quality bag, it will last throughout your child’s baby and toddler years. Getting that much use out of the bag can make the investment worthwhile. Cheaper bags, on the other hand, tend to wear out far more quickly.

                You have a thirty pound child on one side (or a big and bulky infant seat carrier), and a humongous, equally heavy bag on your fragile wrist on your other side.
               </p>
               <p>
                You probably look like quite the circus performer maneuvering around with both!
               </p>
               <p>
                A diaper backpack will help you take the load off your side and will help improve your balance.
               </p>
               <p>
                Really, it is a great way to remain safe because I know a lot of moms who have toppled over while making their exit, who have strained their backs and arms with the bag, and who have also lost their balance when going up and down steps with it in hand along with their child.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most diaper packs tend to be much smaller than a

                bag.

               <p>
                I don’t know about you, but I really don’t need all of that room in that bag. A back pack gives me plenty of space and it has just as many compartments as my

               </p>
               <p>
                And the main selling point for me is that I also have one whole arm and hand free!
               </p>
               <p>
                It doesn’t sound very exciting, but it makes a world of difference. I no longer struggle to carry in a bag or two from the grocery store with my baby and bag in tow. More at

                What to look for in a great diaper backpack.

              <div class="tve_cb_cnt tve_empty_dropzone">
               <p>
                If you’re considering making the switch from bag to pack, here are some key characteristics to consider:
               </p>
               <div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_bullets_shortcode">
                <ul class="tve_ul tve_ul1 tve_purple">
                 <li class="">
                  <span class="bold_text">
                   <span style="color: #7445c3;">
                    It’s strong
                   </span>
                  </span>
                  . And by strong, I mean it can handle everything from diapers, to a change of clothes, to wipes, and even a few bottles (I’ve even tossed a canister for formula in mine). You don’t want something that will stretch and sag over time due to weight restrictions. Look for a good, strong bag so it works effectively for you.
                 </li>
                 <li class="">
                  <span class="bold_text">
                   <span style="color: #7445c3;">
                    Adjustable straps
                   </span>
                  </span>
                  . Sometimes you will be wearing your backpack with a winter coat, other times with nothing. You want to make sure it fits you comfortably and snug so you don’t have to worry about pushing it back into place.
                 </li>
                 <li class="">
                  <span class="bold_text">
                   <span style="color: #7445c3;">
                    It’s roomy
                   </span>
                  </span>
                  . Obviously you don’t want to look like a nomad when wearing one, but you do want something large enough to carry all of your essentials. A great rule of thumb? Pick something that reminds you of the backpack you used to carry in elementary school. That was big enough to carry your lunch bag, books, and binders, so it’s sure to be big enough to carry your baby items.
                 </li>
                 <li class="">
                  <span class="bold_text">
                   <span style="color: #7445c3;">
                    It has compartments
                   </span>
                  </span>
                  . One thing I do love about a diaper bag is that it is filled with compartments. It allowed me to stick my hand in the bag and pull out whatever I needed without looking because I had my organizational system on lock down. Packs also come with compartments, so make sure you get enough and set up a similar system. Also, it’s always an added bonus when it has a bottle holder compartment, so you don’t need to bring any kind of additional small bags to store your bottles in.
                 </li>
                 <li class="">
                  <span class="bold_text">
                   <span style="color: #7445c3;">
                    It wipes clean
                   </span>
                  </span>
                  . Much like a diaper bag, you want to make sure your pack is able to be cleaned with ease. Without fail, you will always get some kind of fluid on it, whether it is bodily or a bottle that leaks. Always go for something easy to clean.
                 </li>
                 <li class="">
                  <span class="bold_text">
                   <span style="color: #7445c3;">
                    It’s affordable
                   </span>
                  </span>
                  . You don’t have to pay an arm and a leg for a great bag. Shop around to not only get something that you love, but is a bargain buy!
                 </li>
                </ul>
               </div>
              </div>
             </div>
            </div>
            <p>
             So, are you ready to make the switch from bag to pack?
            </p>
            <p>
             Doing so changed my life, and saved my poor arms!
