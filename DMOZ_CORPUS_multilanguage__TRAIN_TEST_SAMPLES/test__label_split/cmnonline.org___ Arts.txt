          “I believe everything is educational, in that it says something about how one looks at the world. Children learn from context. They learn vocabulary and language not from a dictionary or worksheet, but from conversation, they learn songs not from reading music, but from singing with someone who loves to sing, and they learn hope and kindness and cooperation  not from being told to have them, but by experiencing them.” –

Peel away the layers of each song and listeners uncover something new every time they hear it.  Winner of 5 awards!
