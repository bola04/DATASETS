         We've migrated Bipartite away from New Jersey to New York. It's not a far move and therefore we do not anticipate latency changes. We have officially deprecated the previous FQDN of bipartite.nj.us.swiftirc.net in favor of bipartite.ny.us.swiftirc.net. The former will continue to be supported until August 2016.

         Goodbye Sara!

       <p>
        Users of SwiftIRC I come to you today with the saddest of news.  After 6 years of service as an IRC Operator and Network Administrator of SwiftIRC Sara has decided to step down from her position and enter retirement.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        From a young age Sara had always aspired to be a Network Administrator.  She had a love for chatting, and a thirst for power.  Young Sara was brought on as a Help Operator and worked very hard helping users and developing scripts to make her more efficient and successful, much to the dissatisfaction of her peers.  She rose quickly in the ranks, which some attribute to her being a woman and, others, to her craft knowledge on how to play the system.  Little is known if these rumors are true, but once reaching the ranks she proved herself to be a more than capable IRC Operator.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I would like to think that I was her biggest inspiration, to be honest.  It was my experience and craftiness that she always seemed to try to mimic or copy.  I gladly stepped aside as she pushed her way forward, much more interested in seeing her succeed than to get my own selfish wishes granted.  She will deny it, of course, but we NA now (what's she going to do, fire me?)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sadly, with all the users wanting to talk about botting and phishing, many Network Administrators left leaving a few open positions.  Sara’s dream of being a Network Administrator was finally achieved, her tears of joy lasted days, nay, years.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We would like to wish Sara the best as life carries her away from us, and hopes that she might come and visit from time to time.  She has proven to be an effective leader, and a positive female figurehead among the sausage-dominated staff team, and she will be missed much more than that Alex guy who left that everybody forgot about.
        <br/>
        Take care Sara, don’t forget to take your vitamins, look both ways before crossing the street, and make lots of money so you can pay us back for all the stuff we had to do for you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        &lt;3

       <p>
        Last month we elaborated on the downtime of a number of our services from approximately 1st April - 9th April 2013.  We revealed that the downtime was a result of our admins identifying "suspicious activity" surrounding our primary server.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Three days ago, a hacking group published a document detailing some of their latest activities.  In it, they claim that SwiftIRC servers were targeted because they believed that a rival group may be using our network for their own communication.  The document goes on to detail how the group compromised some high profile targets including Linode and its domain registrar, all in an effort to gain access to SwiftIRC servers and consequently the unnamed rival group.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We can confirm that SwiftIRC uses Linode to host a variety of our services, and that in the early hours of April 1st 2013 we were alerted to suspicious activity on our primary server (specifically, an unexpected reboot).  While investigating the cause of this reboot we also became locked out of our Linode management account.  At this point we requested assistance from Linode, and thankfully they were able to rapidly investigate and disable our compromised account as well as shut down the affected server to prevent any further damage.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With the server offline and assumed secure for the time being, we began attempting to discover the root cause of this security compromise.  Unfortunately, we were unable to find any explanation for the compromise through the expected channels (an admin's home computer being compromised etc.).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        During our post-mortem we were also able to identify the activity that took place on our compromised server during the approximately 20 minute window that it was accessed.  It appears that in addition to gathering basic information on the server itself, the attacker was attempting to create some sort of backdoor into our server as well as create a compressed archive of various locations on our server, apparently intending to retrieve it at a later date from our own web site.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, based on what we have been able to determine, the attempts to retrieve any of our internal or user data were unsuccessful through this vector due to the limited amount of time that the server was accessible.  While it appeared that the server was not irrevocably compromised, we decided to err on the side of caution and keep it offline while preparing a brand new server installation.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With regard to the allegation that this security compromise (as well as that of our service provider) was related to a "rival group" using our services, we have conducted a basic analysis of our current user base and concluded that the majority of our users and channels are legitimate.  Obviously it is entirely possible for users to create private channels and discuss any subject -- controversial or not -- without oversight or knowledge from the network staff or users in general.  This is a result of SwiftIRC's size and diversity, and while it is regrettably possible for a small number of users to cause trouble for the network at large, we do not believe that this is a fair reflection of SwiftIRC or its users in general.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This overall situation, if reported accurately, is concerning for us as it is unlike anything else we have seen in our 8+ years of operation.  With this eye-opener on the sorts of unwanted attention our network could conceivably receive, we will endeavour to refine our own security policies and practises so that we are in a better position to avoid any further issues of this nature.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We would like to thank you for your understanding and continued support for SwiftIRC.

        Let it be known that henceforth, Intersect and its Server Administrator Nerdie is delinked from the network.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Please keep in mind that this means Nerdie is no longer a staff member, and should not be trusted with any 'confidential' information.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Consequently, we have performed some maintenance on our servers and we encourage users experiencing any instability to please come to #support and report it to an Operator there.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In more important (and much more interesting) news, we have decided to promote Jake to the role of IRC Operator in hopes that he will bring some sort of order to the chaos.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We welcome Jake and the ideas and support he brings to the network, and thank him for all the service he has provided as a Help Operator.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Please treat him with respect (or not) as he goes through the transition stage and learns the ropes

         Recent Downtime
        </a>

       <p>
        Hello,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We recently experienced an outage that was due to our web server being potentially compromised. We'd like to stress that no user information was leaked and no data integrity was lost. In order to explain why the downtime was so long, we've put together the following timeline of events.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        1. Admins were alerted that there was suspicious activity on the server and took steps to minimize the potential for data to be collected and leaked.
        <br/>
        2. When these steps failed, the server was shut down, thus halting all operations on the server and locking out undetermined intruders.
        <br/>
        3. The server was audited to see whether an intrusion had indeed occured.
        <br/>
        4. After examining the server, it was determined that no compromise had occured and all data was intact. A decision was made to rebuild the server from scratch.
        <br/>
        5. The server was rebuilt, and as of now everything is back online.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        During situations like this, it's important that the issue be isolated quickly to prevent irreparable damage. Our main concern was determining whether user data had been compromised while also minimizing the effect of the outage. Almost every staff member on the team had a hand in resolving this issue from rebuilding the server to being on hand to answer support queries and assist users with issues. We're proud of how our team handled this and commend them for their responsiveness and hard work.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        All services should be operating normally at this time. If you experience any issues please let us know in #support.
       </p>
