      A world of quality music-making with quality socialising too!
     </p>
     <p>
      CUBB is a student-run society for people who enjoy playing brass band music in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. There are no auditions and everyone is welcome at our weekly rehearsals - these are held every Thursday from 8 till 10pm during term-time at Lee Hall, Wolfson College (see
      <a href="http://map.cam.ac.uk/Lee+Seng+Tee+Hall#52.199325,0.103699,17" target="_blank">
       map
      </a>
      ). Alternative rehearsals are usually organised by those staying in Cambridge during the vacations so that CUBB fun continues after term finishes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The band performs concerts in and around Cambridge, as well as arranging small groups of players for busking and other events such as Christmas Dinners or Bavarian Nights. At the end of Lent term, CUBB embarks on its annual tour visiting a different part of the UK each year - recent locations include Cheshire and North Wales in 2018, Derbyshire and Yorkshire in 2017 and Cologne in 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      We also arrange a variety of social events including formal halls, pancakes and Brassed Off and punting trips on the Cam. After rehearsals there is also an opportunity for further socialising in the Wolfson College Bar. For more details check out the rest of our website.

        There are only two weeks until we depart on our annual tour. This year we're heading to Cheshire and North Wales for three days for a mixture of playing and sightseeing. If you happen to be in or around Chester on Saturday 24th March, then it would be great to see you at our concert in St John the Baptist Church, Chester.

       17/02/18: UniBrass Success! =D
      </h3>
      <div id="newsitem">
       <p>
        The band are thrilled to announce that we have finally come away with some silverware. We were delighted to be awarded the prize for the most entertaining band in our section and came 6th overall out of 11 bands. Perhaps most importantly for our university pride, we also triumphed over Oxford :P.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to the other bands, it's been a good day of music making! The challenge will be to come up with something as entertaining next year in Bangor (the new host university)...
