       Web-based systems. Reactive UIs. Data pipelines. Automated deployments. Friendly workflows. Real-time dashboards. Serverless architectures. Streaming buzzwords.

       Talk to us about your next technology project. We have significant experience developing, deploying and maintaining software products. We love to build things which people like to use, using pragmatic and appropriate technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the things we're good at: Web applications with thoughtful user interfaces and smart workflows. Data-processing systems for metrics, dashboards and reporting. Automated server- and cloud-based deployments. Shiny, new buzzword avoidance.

       As a developer here, you get to make the best decisions for the software you work on, fully cognisant of the business goals and quality requirements involved. You get to set the technology direction and make the decisions with your colleagues. As a partner or customer, well, you get to work with a development team who are on your side, all the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our technology choices change over time, as you'd expect. We're not an XYZ shop, we don't fanatically subscribe to any particular methodology. Instead we encourage directed geek curiosity, targeted towards making sure we're using technologies and processes most appropriate to the task at hand. And that we grok and enjoy.

       All of this means that when you come to work with us, you'll be in a situation which encourages you to do your best work, to explore the things which capture your attention, and grow, and to have fun doing it with other like-minded people. And if you choose to partner with us for your project, then you get a happy, productive and engaged team, with your best interests at heart.

       <strong>
        Web designer / presentation layer person
       </strong>
       : if you're into web design and/or love nothing more than pushing html and css (and the modern front-end build chain) to their limits in pursuit of interface perfection, then we may have a space for you. We have plenty of front-end work on both established and new projects. This is a position that would be suitable for a more junior designer/developer looking to grow their skills.
