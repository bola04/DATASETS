        In 1850 local surgeon William Penny Brookes (1809 - 1895), who was one of the people credited with introducing physical education into British schools, inspired the fore-runner of the modern Olympic Games for the "
        <em>
         promotion of moral, physical and intellectual improvement
        </em>
        " and although the Game's venue is now decided by international committee rather than by the parish council, we still hold our own Olympian games here every July - the other Olympian games are also doing quite well too!

       <p>
        William Penny Brookes vision for the Wenlock Olympic Games is hailed as one of modern sports greatest achievements. Of course, Baron de Coubertin was inspired to create the global event after a visit to the games in Much Wenlock.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coubertin discussed how the Wenlock games might be translated on to a bigger, international stage.

        The influential and wealthy Frenchman was suitably inspired and shared Brookes' dream of a modern, international games. The first games of the modern Olympics took place in Athens in 1896.
       </p>
       <p>
        Juan Antonio Samaranch, then president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), visited Much Wenlock in 1994 and laid a wreath at Brookes' grave and commented:

         Wenlock Priory
        </a>

        The Wenlock Olympian Games (which inspired the modern Olympics) started in 1850 and are still held every year. Visitors can follow the
