      Burnside Carpets was founded in 1975 by father and son, George Burnside Senior and George Junior.
     </p>
     <p>
      The company is now run by George Junior and his two daughters, Louise and Emma and his sister Marina.
     </p>
     <p>
      The business has been built on personal customer attention and recommendations and we have now over
 		 31 years of practical experience with supplying and fitting all kinds of flooring.
     </p>
     <p>
      The emphasis has been based on customer service and satisfaction. Our premises on High Northgate has
 		 grown from being only one small showroom to now encompass three adjoining premises, one of which is our 
 		 ‘Rug Gallery’.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directly opposite our main showroom, you’ll find Burnside’s carpet and vinyl warehouse, which consists 
 		of factory clearance roll-ends and a large selection of vinyl cushioned flooring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our most recent expansion was two years ago with the opening of another 3000ft warehouse which allows us to stock
 		 more rolls of carpets and room sized remnants.
     </p>
     <p>
      We pride ourselves on our expert fitting service which has grown from simply being George on his own, to now six
 		 teams of carpet fitters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our opening hours are
      <strong>
       9.00am – 5.15pm Monday to Saturday
      </strong>
      .
