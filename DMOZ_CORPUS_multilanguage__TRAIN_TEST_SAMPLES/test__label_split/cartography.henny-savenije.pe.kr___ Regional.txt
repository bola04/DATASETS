        <p>
         Western cartography starts with the revival of knowledge of Claudius 
             Ptolemy's Geographia soon after the year 1400 AD. Greek manuscript 
             copies made in the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, were brought by 
             scholars to Italy from Constantinople and subsequently translated 
             into Latin and widely studied. Ptolemy lived in the 2nd century AD 
             in Egypt. He divided the world in 360 degrees and introduced a method 
             to establish meridians and parallels and projected the round shape 
             of the world on a flat surface. Geographers and astronomers were influenced 
             by his work for about 1500 years. Nothing of his original work remains 
             and we can only see his maps by the diligent work of monks who copied 
             his works and probably made their own small contributions and interpretations 
             as well. The coincidental invention of Gutenberg, the art of printing, 
             made large numbers of copies possible. On the available copies from 
             the maps of Ptolemy we can find no mentioning of Korea.

         Another 
             far reaching impact was that the Turks conquered Constantinople and 
             Europe was cut off from its trade routes to the far-east, which had 
             always passed through Constantinople. This made it necessary for Europeans 
             to look for other ways to look for the supplies they needed (For all 
             the thumbnails [the small pictures] you can click on it to see the 
             complete map, it will open a new window, the new window closes when 
             you click on the map again)

         The first explorer to name Korea was Marco Polo in the end of the 
             13th century. He describes the battle of Kubilai Kahn against Najan, 
             who tried to grasp the power from his uncle. When Kubilai defeated 
             Najan, Polo mentioned that the barons and soldiers of Najan pledged 
             loyalty to Kubilai and they were representing four provinces: Djurtsjet, 
             Kauli, Barskol and Sikintingin. Kauli is believed to be Korea whether 
             this word refers to the state or Koryo or the Korean peninsula as 
             a whole. The northern part of Korea was conquered by the Mongolians 
             as early as 1231. (Il Millione The original travel accounts by Maria 
             Bellonci Torino Edizioni RAI Radiotelevisione Italiana, 1982)
        </p>
        <p>
         We will see further on, that we still find the name Kauli on some 
             maps. Obviously someone made the connection between Polo's Kauli and 
             Korea.

         Martin Waldeseemüller, was born c. 1470 in Radolfzell, Württemberg 
             and died ca. 1518-1521 in Saint-Dié, Lorraine.

             Geographia, Strassburg 1522. Japan is shown as a trapezium shape. 
             Actually the world image of Ptolemy only reached to the "backside 
             of India". Waldeseemüller has thus taken the information from 
             Marco Polo about Tartary and Zipangri, translated it into a map and 
             added the worldmap of Ptolemy.

         After
              that for some time nobody from the West knew or wrote about Korea.

           <u>
            Gregorio
             de Céspedes
           </u>
          </strong>
         </a>
         (1550-1611) was believed to be the first
              westerner to visit Korea (
         <i>
          Ledyard, the Dutch come to Korea,
         </i>
         page
               102-103), though he wrote no account of the country. He actually
              did 
             visit Korea -- he arrived on December 27, 1593 in Korea, invited
              by  the Christian 'daimyo' Konishi Yukinaga (alias Augustin Arimandono),
              
             one of the three leading generals of the Japanese invasion army.
              Céspedes 
             was a Jesuit. (
         <i>
          Gompertz, G.St.G.M. "Some Notes on the Earliest
              Western Contacts with Korea." Transactions of the Korea Branch
               of the Royal Asiatic Society 33
         </i>
         (1957): 41-54). He stayed until
                April 1594 in Korea. It was reported by a letter of Father Luís
                 Fróis (1532-1597) that around 300.000 Korean prisoners
                 of war  -- mostly "slaves" it seems -- were brought
                 to Nagasaki  as converted Christians. In Francesco Carletti's
                 'Discourses' we find 
             that Carletti in 1597 bought 5 of them, according to him, for ridiculously
                  low prizes: "The country of Korea is said to be divided
                  into  nine provinces, the names of which Cioseien, which is
                  the capital 
             province and gives it's name to the city in which the King resides,
                   Quienqui, Conguan, Honliay, Cioala, Hienfion, Tioneion, Hanquien,
                  
             Pianchien. From these provinces, but particularly from those nearest
                   to the coast, had been brought as slaves a large number of
                  men and 
             women of all ages, among them some quite pretty children. These were
                   all being sold indifferently at a very cheap price, and I bought
                  as 
             many as five for a litle more than twelve scudi." One of Carletti's
              converted Korean pupils later went together with Carletti to Holland
             
             and later to Rome, Italy and lived there -- the first Korean to visit
              Europe -- his name was
         <a name="antonio">
          Antonio
         </a>
         Correa (1578?-1626).
               In the 1610s the Vatican send him to Manchuria to reenter Korea
              as 
             a missionary, but he wasn't successful.. He seemingly married an
              Italian  girl! -- his grandgrandgrandgrand....daughter visited Korea
              in the 
             late 1980s. At least that's what the people in Albi, Italy thought,
               however a chromosome test proved that they had no Korean blood.
              (You 
             can find the article
         <a href="http://www.hendrick-hamel.henny-savenije.pe.kr/newspaper/index.htm">

         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         However, Céspedes wasn't the first westerner to enter Korea. This 
             was a man to which Korean sources refer to as   "Pingni" 
             or "Mari," who landed together with some Chinese on Cheju-do 
             in spring of 1582. He was immediately deported to China.
