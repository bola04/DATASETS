      LABMED has funded 1350 dogs since our inception in 1996. More applications are always in the works. Like all non-profits, we have to make our dollars stretch as far as possible, and because of this, we cannot always offer full funding; rather, we offer partial funding and encourage applicants to try other sources from a list we maintain. We also encourage applicants to supplement what we can give with their own fundraisers such as yard sales, dog walks, bake sales, car washes, and so on.
      <p>
       Even so, we cannot do this work without YOU. Please consider a

       2013 - LABMED was thrilled to announce that we have been awarded a
       <b>
        $2500
 grant by the ASPCA
       </b>
       to continue our mission of funding medical
 treatment for ill and/or injured Labradors and Lab-mixes in rescue
 situations. We are extremely grateful to the ASPCA for considering
 us worthy of this award and we pledge to use it to fund as many dogs
 as we can. We have already used these funds to provide
 for several of our most recent cases for procedures ranging from
 surgery to heartworm treatments. Coming at a time when all
 non-profits are struggling to raise finds, this grant has been a
 blessing. On behalf of the dogs we have helped and will continue to
 help, thank you, ASPCA!

 <h2>LABMED Funds Seven Dogs with Pedigree Grant
 </h2><p/>
 LABMED sincerely thanks the Pedigree Foundation for providing us with 
 a grant that enabled us to fund the following dogs in 2009:
 <p/>
 Gunner -  $123.91
 <br>Ellie6 -    $500
 <br>Maggie8 - $200
 <br>Brady2 -  $400
 <br>Morty -   $300
 <br>Opal -     $200
 <br>Buddy42 - $16.89 towards total funding of $200
  
  
  
 <p>LABMED has funded 1100 dogs since our inception -- lucky number 1000 was . . . Rylee, a handsome one-year-old male chocolate Lab found as a 
 stray in Ohio suffering from heartworm disease. LABMED provided the funding for his treatment.</p>

     We regretfully announce that LABMED has temporarily suspended taking 
 applications for funding. Like many other charities, we have been 
 affected by the poor economy and have not received sufficient 
 donations to keep going. We will continue our fund-raising efforts 
 during this period and hope to be able to reopen soon. Please check

       Memorial Funds
      </h3>
      <p>
       Due to the generosity of several special Lab-lovers, LABMED is thrilled to 
       offer these memorial funds. We invite you to read more about these special donors
       and dogs memorialized by these funds by clicking on the links below:

       The
       <a href="buddyarnold.html">
        Buddy Arnold Memorial Fund
       </a>
       was established through 
 a very special gift from Jack and Anne Arnold in memory of their beloved chocolate Lab, Buddy to provide funding for the medical care of the first Lab or Lab-mix each month.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img align="left" alt="Pecos" border="0" height="110" src="pictures/pecos_2.jpg" width="80"/>

       The
       <a href="http://www.labmed.org/pecos_fund.html">
        Pecos Memorial Fund
       </a>
       was established through the generosity of
       <a href="http://www.georgialabrescue.com">
        Georgia Lab Rescue
       </a>
       to provide funds for Labs and Lab-mixes who are in need
       of medical treatment due to abuse or neglect. Pecos, a yellow Lab, 
       did not survive his injuries, but his memory will live on as other dogs
       are helped through this fund.

       <a href="max.html">
        Max's Fund
       </a>
       was established by 
 several individuals who were profoundly touched in a lasting way by a wonderful 
 Labrador Retriever named Max. Each month, this fund will help a Lab or Lab-mix and 
 memorialize Max's infinite capacity for unconditional love.
