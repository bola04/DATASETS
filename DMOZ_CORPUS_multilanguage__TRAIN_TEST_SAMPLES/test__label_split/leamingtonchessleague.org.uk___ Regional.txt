   The League AGM was held at the Olton venue on the 29th May.
   <br/>
   There were two changes to the rules:-
   <br/>
   From next season the League will implement a player registration system.
   <br/>
   The proposed rule is available in the AGM minutes page of the website.
   <br/>
   Clubs can submit minor changes to the committee for consideration before the rule is finalised.
   <br/>
   The other rule change that was accepted by the meeting was to change to a single 90 minute time period
   <br/>
   with no time controls.
   <br/>
   The Officials of the League are listed in the Officials page.
   <br/>
   The Trophy winners are listed in the Roll Of Honour page.
   <br/>
   The League formation for the coming year is in the Formation page.
   <br/>
   Can club secretaries check the entries are correct.
   <br/>
   Can club secretaries send me details of team captains, secretaries etc as soon as they become available.

   28 players from the Leamington League competed in the annual 5-minute
   <b>
    Lightning/Blitz Tournament
   </b>
   at Solihull's venue, the Blossomfield Club.
   <br/>
   There were sections for Open, Under 140 and Under 110 players.
   <br/>
   Early front runners were Ian Brodie, Mark Page and Nigel Towers, later Robert Reynolds and Neil Clarke tried but failed to keep pace with Mark.
   <br/>
   Eventually conceding just half a point, Mark Page won the Open title for the second time.
   <br/>
   Robert Reynolds finished runner up with Mark Cundy coming in third.
   <br/>
   In the under 140 section, Roy Watson, Rayyan Farooq and Alex Kaghalis were within half a point at the half way stage.
   <br/>
   Mike Johnson made a late effort but it was Rayyan who won the section with 5½ out of 9.
   <br/>
   Rayyan had won the section the previous year.
   <br/>
   In the Under 110 section, Penny Wood retained the trophy with 3½ points from Sean McHugh on 3.
   <br/>
   The trophies were presented by the League Chairman, Ben Graff.
   <br/>
   Thanks to Rob and Richard Reynolds for organising the event and to Solihull for hosting it.

    </b>
    tournament takes place at
    <b>
     Solihull's Chess Club venue
    </b>
    ,
    <br/>
    The Blossomfield Club, The Wardens, Widney Lane, Solihull, B91 3JY, on Wednesday 25th April, starting at 7:30pm.
    <br/>
    Entry is £1 per person, all monies collected will be returned in prizes.
    <br/>
    There will be 9 rounds at 5 minutes per game, paired on the Swiss system.
    <br/>
    Prizes will be awarded in the Open and Minor sections, grading limit for the minor will depend on entries.
    <br/>
    If there are enough entrants there will be 3 sections - Open, Under 140, and Under 100, as last year.
    <br/>
    I would ask entrants to arrive before 7:30 in order to ensure a prompt start.
    <br/>
    Can clubs make their members aware of the event, a good attendance always makes the tournament more interesting.

     League AGM
    </b>
    will take place on

    <br/>
    An agenda will be circulated nearer the time and we will also hold the annual prize giving.

    Please could all trophies be returned to Ben Graff as soon as possible, so that they can all be engraved prior to this.
    <br/>
    The League Committee are meeting on the 24th April to prepare for the AGM.
    <br/>
    Could any issues that you would like to see raised at the Committee be tabled with Ben.
    <br/>
    The League is suffering from an acute shortage of officers.

    We need to fill a range of posts this AGM for the League to continue to function properly.

    I have now been reduced to submitting one of my games in the Best Game competition.
    <br/>
    This is a desperate attempt to shame people into submitting their games.
    <br/>
    Why not submit one of your games?
    <br/>
    Surely you must have played one game this season which wasn't too bad?
    <br/>
    If so, please send your entry to me, preferably in pgn notation.

    Another Individual Finalist. Well done to Stratford's
    <b>
     Peter Stiff
    </b>
    on reaching the final of the Under 125.
    <br/>
    Peter  was surely one of the competitions rank outsiders, having the lowest grade in the section (92), an early exit was highly likely.
    <br/>
    Try telling that to Peter!
    <br/>
    After knocking out John Green (128), Andy Johnson (120) and Steve Henderson (120) Peter's tournament grade is a whopping 172.
