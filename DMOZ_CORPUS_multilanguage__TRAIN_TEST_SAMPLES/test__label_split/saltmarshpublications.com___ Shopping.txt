       Surviving Sarasota

     is set in 
 Southwest Florida in 1851 and tells the story of the first settlers in both 
 Manatee Village and in William and Mary Jane Whitaker's home at Yellow Bluffs on 
 Sarasota Bay. Having allowed the feared Seminole Chief Billy Bowlegs to recover 
 from a bout of malaria behind her family's home, Mary Jane gains the man's 
 friendship--which continues when Mary Jane marries William Whitaker and moves to 
 his home on Sarasota Bay. The friendship ends abruptly, however, when the Third 
 Seminole War breaks out and the Seminoles loot and burn homesteads from Fort 
 Myers to Manatee Village. Shortly after the Seminoles are moved to Oklahoma, the 
 advent of the Civil War brings new woes to the citizens when the Union sends 
 gunboats to surround the state and cut off all attempts to gain supplies for the 
 citizens.

       Over the Bridge

     is a 
 fictionalized account of five high school seniors in a small town in West 
 Virginia in 1941, who are discussing their plans for graduation--when they will 
 go "Over the Bridge" into nearby Maryland and the rest of the world.  As 
 they discuss their plans, the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor comes over the 
 general store's radio and subsequently changes all their hopes and dreams.  
 The story relates life in the 1940's, recounts the first joint British/U.S. 
 combat in North Africa at the Kasserine Pass, and reflects the mores of the 
 era--ending in the present day.
