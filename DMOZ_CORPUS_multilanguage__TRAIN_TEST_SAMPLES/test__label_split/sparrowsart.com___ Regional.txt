        Working with Lori has been a pleasure. When we first began looking into initiating an overhaul of our website, we didn’t know where to begin. Lori helped talk us through the entire process and was very helpful, taking time to understand exactly what we wanted from our new website. Her professionalism, advice and assistance throughout the process were invaluable.

            Amie outgrew her previous site and needed a website redesign that was a little less cluttered. Her new site has plenty of white space while still providing the information her customers need. The design reflects her agency’s lighthearted and happy personality.

            The museum was interested in a site that they could easily update and showcase their collections of nursing artifacts.  We decided on a wordpress site with the Genesis framework and child theme.

           <p class="uk-text-primary uk-h3">
            I am a board member of the Museum of Nursing History and have had my RN since 1957.  I became active with the museum in 2004. The web site for the museum consisted of several broken links, misinformation, and three different addresses. Need I go on?
            <br/>
            This situation, in my opinion, was intolerable.  Getting the web site fixed presented its own set of problems with the board.  With perseverance, 5 proposals and the recommendation of a satisfied customer, Lori was selected to fix our website.  Not an easy task I must say.
            <br/>
            In addition, several retired and close to retirement nurses wished to be the content managers.  She had to walk us through; do a lot of handholding, furnish some anti-anxiety reassurance (You get the picture). It is hard to believe; here we are working on our web site, adding content and so forth. I invite you to visit the web site Museum of Nursing History.org and see for yourself!
