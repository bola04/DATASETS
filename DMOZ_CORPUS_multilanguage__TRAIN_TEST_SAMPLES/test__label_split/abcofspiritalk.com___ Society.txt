           ABC of Spirit Talk is a journey of mind into the reaches of inner space. We hope to guide you on a path to ‘self discovery’. A hackneyed term yet effectual in this instance to convey the meaning behind our title. For indeed dear ones, we wish to take you on a journey of inner awakening. The soul, indeed. It is to the soul of man we wish to take you. Read on, dear hearts, and enjoy our website ‘ABC of SPIRIT TALK’.
          </p>
          <p>
           Carolyn is a free spirited lover of all things natural. Yes, this is indeed true. She delves into all manner of things. One of her pleasures is listening to the dulcet tones of those in the so called ‘heavenly regions’. Yes she hears spirit. We have requested that she take it upon herself to furnish her brothers and sisters of the world with the news which comes from this region of being; from us, her so called ‘guides’. A cruel term for it implies that she cannot do this herself, which of course is sheer fantasy. She is a master of logic. She understands the intricacies of life, the earth and those upon it. She has made it her concern in this lifetime to spend her days willingly in the service of others. To this extent we, her guides, seek her boundless energy to help in the cultivation of the higher insights to permeate this level of existence; namely earth, in order for the planet to progress as indeed it must and will continue to do. To this end we, her guides, hope to make available to you, dear reader, a multitude of knowledge which we hope shall make life easier for those who choose to read.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have started our journey with the obvious; our companions of the animal kingdom. We shall endeavour to bring further understandings from the various kingdoms upon earth however for now we shall concentrate on our tiny cousins the family cat and dog.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those of you who would like more information regarding your favourite little pet can email Carolyn along with a small fee and she, with our help, shall answer your most needed questions. We shall do this with delight and glee, as shall our dear Carolyn, for we all like to work together. A happy and most harmonious group are we.
          </p>
          <p>
           The price shall be $100AUD (Australian dollars) for an extensive coverage of your life, family, general problems etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, as you see fit. If only a small question is asked $20 shall be the fee. Three or more questions and we shall ask that you send $50 as our service fee; for Carolyn needs to provide herself with lodgings, clothes, hairstyling, make up, etcetera, and we would not want her to experience lack because she chooses to work upon this beautiful planet in this means. Yes, she too has her needs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, with that settled we shall go on to more pressing needs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Life, yes life. We all want to know more about life. Do we not? Indeed we do. Our friends in the animal kingdom hold much by way of understanding about life. They, our furry friends, hold up a mirror in front of us. They encompass many of the energies which we experience throughout our life time. They, our dear animal friends, seek out, as do we, our counterpart in human form. Oh yes, they too need to join with a human in order to progress. By doing so we are all helped. The energies combine and we have the opportunity to see ourselves one in the other. The energies of our furry friend are just as intricate as our own. Nevertheless we see our own vision as if in a mirror.
          </p>
          <p>
           For those of us who can’t see this vision there is Carolyn and ‘we of the higher realms’, so called, to assist in the seeing. Yes our aim is to enlighten you to yourself firstly through the animals which you acquire throughout your lifetime. Later we shall move into other realms of understanding but for now we shall stay with the animal kingdom. And firstly we shall begin with the cat and dog who have allowed themselves to be domesticated for the purpose of change.
          </p>
          <p>
           We hope that you avail yourself of our assistance and look forward to working with our dear Carolyn once again.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many blessings dear ones.
          </p>
          <p>
           I remain yours truly
          </p>
          <p>
           Soul Friend and co.
          </p>
          <p>
           About Carolyn.
          </p>
          <p>
           My name is Carolyn and I have been blessed with the ability to hear spirit for the past fifteen or so years. This has been the delight of my life conversing with my spirit friends. It is a very natural thing for me to talk with those who, although they can’t be seen by most; live, love and have their being alongside us in the spirit. They have a wealth of knowledge and are pleased to share the mysteries of life with me. In particular is Soul Friend (as he likes to be known). He is the leader of our merry band of five. By that I mean that there is me (the earthly one) and four of them (the heavenly ones).
          </p>
          <p>
           We, over the years, have done many things together by way of giving spiritual information, physical advice plus gently offering ourselves to those who seek more than the obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
           And this we now would like to share with you via the internet (the newest tool of communication). I offer our services to you, dear reader. Please avail yourself of the help which I have been most fortunate to have in my life. I’m sure that you will gain much from the pearls of wisdom which my dear friends in spirit have to offer.

           Sharing My Personal Experience
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to share the process that I have worked through this past month…….
          </p>
          <p>
           Excerpt from a post:  ~   My daughter has completely betrayed my trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have negotiated with her with certain curfews, phone time and party time, etc., and she decided to lie to me despite this. I have never been so betrayed by someone I love so much. It is not the same betrayal felt when a partner abuses – it is worse. I thought we were in a really good space but I am dealing with irrational behaviour and I can’t take responsibility for her actions what so ever. I did aide and abet by driving her to what I thought was her party destination. I foolishly bought soft drinks and chips and gave her money – HOW STUPID I FEEL…….  ~
          </p>
          <p>
           Excerpt from another post:  ~   I felt stupid and angry for not listening to my intuition
          </p>
          <p>
           and taking notice of repetitious thoughts that were occurring in my mind. On some level I may not have wanted to prevent this from happening. I am not happy with the way I behaved when she arrived home because I could not be completely objective. She was incredibly insightful regarding her irrational behaviour however, I made it clear that there would be consequences for her actions. I believe that she is remorseful and I forgive her but I want to be able to rise above this situation and move on.  ~
          </p>
          <p>
           Objectivity…….
          </p>
          <p>
           While speaking to CCC I had completed 38% of the lesson of objectivity regarding my daughter’s irrational behaviour. I quickly discovered where there was more work to be done…..
          </p>
          <p>
           Catherine’s planned truce…I had planned a shopping trip to reconnect with Pariz after we had processed some of our behaviour regarding the incident. I relapsed into my old way of behaving when Pariz bumped into one of the friends she went to Sydney with (without my permission). Feelings of betrayal, deceit and hurt all came flooding back to me. Pariz immediately knew my mood had switched and she pleaded with me not to let this spoil our day. I told her exactly how I felt and that I needed space to work these feelings through on my own (in the middle of the shopping mall). She went one way, I went the other. This assisted me and what generally would have taken me days to process took no more than half an hour. This is still a lengthy amount of time but it is progress and I know that I will be tested again and again until I have done 51%.
          </p>
          <p>
           Life would be extremely difficult for us both if I had not had this guidance and understanding. I would be asking questions as to where I went wrong. I would be feeling inadequate in dealing with the adolescent clients I counsel and most importantly my relationship with my daughter would suffer greatly. Now I realise that we will have the bond that is predestined because I will be objective toward her irrational behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
           A week has passed and now I see my daughter with deep compassion. If it is not hard enough for her to be pretty, witty and brightpretty, witty and bright pretty, witty and bright(our song), she has a personality trait that is irrational and needs to be tempered. Not to mention she is going through adolescence and is also clairvoyant – (this last gift can also be a hindrance at times).
          </p>
          <p>
           We have become more united through adversity. I have drawn the rune of partnership……

           Relinquishing Control
          </p>
          <p>
           This past month has been so rewarding.
          </p>
          <p>
           It has been difficult, interesting and self realising. I have come down to my last penny and have been able to smile knowing that my faith and the universal energies will provide me with what I need, when I need it.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have processed fear in the form of many insecurities. Some of these were deeply seeded and others so subtle that I had not known they were present. An example of these were my control issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           As my daughters grow they need to make their own mistakes, as hard as it is to watch this. I needed to change my vocabulary in a big way. I would catch myself time and again telling them what to do with statements like “I don’t want you to go out tonight because you have a cold.” This has been replaced by “Will your cold become worse if you go out tonight?” This is a simple sentence rephrased but it allows the choice for her to make the decision for herself and for me to relinquish control over her actions.
          </p>
          <p>
           I did not realise how often this was occurring and it became obvious to her when I would correct myself in mid sentence. She sees me changing and admires it, and knows we are at work together on a more equal footing. This process makes life more enjoyable for us both and helps her to live her life and me to live mine. Many mums and dads will go through this process with their teenagers. The secret is taking a back step, guiding them and reminding them there is always a pathway to you regardless of the choices they make.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Ongoing Releasement
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Work and the continual releasement of self worth issues have been the focus for me this month.
          </p>
          <p>
           These issues have presented in ways that have created a feeling of un-comfort ability. I will describe this feeling not unlike being trapped in an elevator – not that I have been trapped in an elevator.
          </p>
          <p>
           My body language changes and I recoil in a sense and my head briefly becomes fussy. If I ignore my inner self the feeling occurs again and again until I say, “OK there’s more depth to this than I realise”, and the CCC (Carolyn &amp; The Collective Consciousness) point me in the right direction.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rounded Rectangular Callout:    Then a physical releasement occurs which for me has been headache and flu. Not well!Despite the fact I have been with these symptoms on and off for one month I have been given the energy to be efficient as I perform the general duties of a single working mum. I have also had my ‘ticked off days’, but in general I have had a clear head despite my unclear head – if you know what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
           This month had been very much about protecting myself by placing my needs first and foremost. I still have much to learn in this regard as I have always put others before self. I have realised lately that most others I am in contact with put themselves first and how foolish I have been.
          </p>
          <p>
           I sense a new level of self worth and inner happiness as this new concept of self unfolds.

           Carolyn, for some years, has been given instruction in regard to the brain.
          </p>
          <p>
           This instruction came as quite a shock to her when it was first given. In essence the learning was: the brain is an instrument incorporated within the flesh of man to enable him to perceive his surroundings; we keep this simple.
          </p>
          <p>
           The brain is not, we repeat ‘not’ capable of love; it is just a machine like instrument capable of input by the senses of the flesh. On its own it is finite; limited in nature.
          </p>
          <p>
           When it is manipulated by spirit, with the energies of love, it is then capable of joining with the soul (the heart centre) and being managed. We say managed because it does not ever lose its rebelliousness; it will always seek to control the vessel.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, love can and does control it, to a degree, whereby it acquiesces; it is quieted, so to speak. It allows a more powerful energy to guide it, namely; the soul or consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many of you reject the words which are written through our dear Carolyn because your brains, and not your souls, are in command. We speak truth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over the coming months more and more love will be engendered into the brains of those who choose this path and they will experience the expansiveness of their spirit/soul/consciousness, and their brain will slowly and surely acquiesce to the promptings of their soul.
          </p>
          <p>
           The C.C.
          </p>
          <p>
           (The Collective Consciousness)
          </p>
          <p>
           The Brain – 2
          </p>
          <p>
           The brain is an instrument capable of receiving from the flesh.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this, it is limited by nature. It has the capacity of understanding of the physical understanding, which is limited in its nature.
          </p>
          <p>
           All are capable of utilising the energies presented in this way; except those who for very specific and pre-determined purposes have not one physical capacity or another. We speak of those who are experiencing blindness, deafness; inability to use certain aspects of their physicality. However, in the main, all are experiencing the physical senses to one degree or another.
          </p>
          <p>
           Having said this we say that this (the physical being) is just an illusion created by spirit (the all) who are enjoying watching the antics of a gigantic illusionary show.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is indeed very difficult for the human brain to comprehend. The writer of this story of ours is still coming to terms with this new found knowledge; albeit at break neck speed, so to speak. We applaud her willingness to partake in this great new adventure of ours. Hers is not an easy task.
          </p>
          <p>
           And so to proceed.
          </p>
          <p>
           We, spirit, are to experience another adventure, as was said. The brain of man is limited in its nature, as has been said. It, the brain, will kick, squabble, jerk, spit and in general misbehave, which is the nature which we as spirit have given to it to add enjoyment to our game. For those who choose to play the game, we shall indeed assist. Ask us to enhance your brain with energy of great magnitude to help assist in the expansion of it.  It will not like this demand; know that this is true. However, one and all, we shall do as indeed we say we shall do. Just ask us and we will assist.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           There is another aspect to the game.
          </p>
          <p>
           We ask that all do 51% of the work before we allow the love to do its miraculous work.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, we ask that each and everyone do 51% of the work upon thyself.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then we shall instigate the manipulation which shall bring about an end to the distress.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are many aspects upon which you will be required to work if indeed your wish for perfection is to come true. Each nuance of perfection must be dealt with individually. By this we mean that you have various areas of concern which currently plague you. One may be that your judgement is poor in a particular area. If, we say, if you have worked upon this aspect of your character to the degree that 51% of the work has been achieved, then and only then shall we manipulate the brain so as to give you relief from your pain. This will be done instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
           You will begin to feel the effects, in some cases instantly, in others, within a few days to approximately one week.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is ‘THE GAME’
          </p>
          <p>
           Play It Well
          </p>
          <p>
           The little one, (Carolyn) has been playing this game with us for some years. She has progressed quite well in the game of love. So too her daughter, our daughter, Veronica. She has been playing the game, not quite as long, and yes she too progresses well.
          </p>
          <p>
           We invite ‘you’ to play the game of love with us.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remembering that;
          </p>
          <p>
           ONE
          </p>
          <p>
           You Need To Have Done 51% Of The Work Before We Can Intervene
          </p>
          <p>
           TWO
          </p>
          <p>
           You Need To Have A Sincere Desire To Progress Along The Path To Perfection, and
          </p>
          <p>
           THREE
          </p>
          <p>
           Be All That You Can Be At All Moments; Remembering That The Brain Will Not Enjoy Your New Found Freedom And Shall Strive To Take Back Control.
          </p>
          <p>
           There Is A Need For Constant Vigilance; This Is Part Of The Game
          </p>
          <p>
           Do well dear ones; enter the game with diligence and calm. A steady brain is a ready brain.
          </p>
          <p>
           Invite us in to tea.

           Carolyn Page &amp; The Collective Consciousness
          </p>
          <p>
           December 2015
          </p>
          <p>
           Well, well, well, dear heart; once again we are here at the typewriter. What shall we speak about? Oh yes, the brain of man; a sorry excuse for intelligence. Our dear one, Carolyn, smiles inwardly for now she too sees the futility of  basking in the atrocities of the brain. This surprises our dear one (our use of the word ‘atrocities’) however be this as it may the word describes succinctly the abhorrent nature of the apparatus ‘brain’.
          </p>
          <p>
           It seeks to control, dear hearts, as we have previously pointed out. It seeks its own reward in all ways. It wishes not to know the truth for truth shall diminish its importance. It is cunning, devilish with an inbred desire for magnanimity. We know that this is true for this is as it has been programmed to do. Not for the feint hearted! No, dear ones, it requires much great courage to enter the flesh and allow our beauteous qualities of spirit to be supplanted by the confines of the brain. And yet, dear ones, this is precisely what we do. We allow ourselves the limitation of the flesh (and other illusions) in order to defray the state of boredom.
          </p>
          <p>
           This understanding is now not so foreign to the one who types. She is a willing writer. She has undergone many changes over the past months and shall continue this forward progress. We salute her determination, her grit, her reliance upon her soul. We offer her our greatest reward; that of the adoration of many as they embrace the understandings which shall come forward through her writings. Indeed, there will be many who shall distort, betray and belittle the greatness of her work, however this is also pre-ordained and she shall take this in her stride. We honour, love and cherish this one who places her life as a duty to those she is to serve; much great love to thee, dear heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           We shall continue:
          </p>
          <p>
           Love is and always has been of the soul; the ‘heart’ as humans understand. This is truth. Many refuse to accept the truth, as has been said, because this truth supplants the brain from its magnanimity, so called. It, the brain, is doing precisely as it has been engineered to do, dear ones. We do not minimise the enormity of the undertaking for those who choose to over ride the workings of this instrument. This is a formidable task, as has been written, and not to be attempted in a half hearted manner; no, dear ones, this will result in fiction being experienced. We say ‘fiction’ for, dear hearts, fiction is what you will experience if sufficient energy is not brought forward for the all encompassing task of overcoming this apparatus. We have made this ‘deliberately’ a task of great hard work and determination. Many fail, dear ones, many shall continue to fail. They shall not recognise the enormity of the task and half heartedly attempt to accomplish this great work. Failure is certain. They shall have many setbacks and proffer excuses such as; this does not work; I have not been given sufficient tutoring; the teacher is at fault. No, dear heart, your own inability to accomplish is based on this one premise; until you have sufficient ‘want’ to achieve this state of being you shall fail without question.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our dear Carolyn has for many years been overcoming slowly the debilitating energies of the brain. Many such as she will succeed. They are a determined bunch of souls who agree that to fail is not in question. Success is the only outcome for such souls. Many shall distort the truth of this statement saying that it is impossible to achieve this state of being however, dear ones, there will be just as many who shall attest to the quality of life as they progress upon their way toward the perfection of which we write. No more pain, no more heartache; objectivity as the basis for all of their logical activities. This will bring many great rewards to them. They will testify to these changes and shall acquire a peace of mind known only to others within the fold. A shorthand of sorts will be common between them as they identify with their own.
          </p>
          <p>
           We honour those who shall enter the game with diligence and calm for they are the forerunners for those to come. We salute you as we salute our dear Carolyn. Many pleasant days ahead!
          </p>
          <p>
           We end our communication here for now and look forward to hearing from you and enjoying the progress which you shall make.

           Carolyn Page &amp; The Collective Consciousness
          </p>
          <p>
           November 2015
          </p>
          <p>
           We were once men too. This surprises some, indeed. We were once men too. We say this again in order for the brain to allow the information to take root. We have all been man; once, twice or many hundreds of thousands of times; each different; each with his/her own needs. We say his/her in order for the brain of man to comprehend. We are of no sexual persuasion; we are spirit and beyond these delineations. However, for the sake of simplicity we say that we, as spirit, enjoy becoming man/woman as a human be-ing in order to defray the state of boredom otherwise endured.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many are beginning to understand. Many are comprehending the words and taking them within. This they are doing because, dear hearts, this is precisely that which you have agreed to do. You may reject; you may revolt; however, dear hearts, those who have agreed to be amongst those who favour the new understandings written through such as our dear Carolyn shall eventually rejoice in the freedom inherent within the understandings; and this is exactly what is happening to our dear Carolyn.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, thank you, you have summed it up quite nicely for me; I do feel a greater freedom than ever before.
          </p>
          <p>
           The teachings of all religion, albeit uplifting and interesting have never really felt absolutely comfortable. However now, with this new appreciation of my conception, I have a knowing that this is so. At first this was not the case; my brain did have a hard time coming to terms with that which was unfamiliar. However now that I have had time to filter the information, I feel at ease. I don’t know whether or not this new understanding is ‘truth’; I am being truthful; however it ‘feels’ right for me.
          </p>
          <p>
           With this new feeling of rightness has come many feelings of being ‘at ease’. I find myself not at all concerned about other’s opinions and ‘want’ them to have their own understandings. I don’t feel the need for acceptance as once I did. I no longer ‘care’. To explain; I realise now, after having gone through these mental processes of the past few months, that I was once so concerned about the opinions of others regarding me; I didn’t realise then that they were so deeply entrenched. It is only now, because I have undergone these changes and have witnessed these changes within myself, that I can now say categorically that I was once such a people pleaser and wanted all and sundry to like me or at least accept me. Now this is no longer an issue for me. I take great store in having my own understanding; that was something that used to concern me; the fact that many of my understandings were far from the norm. And I ‘want’ others to have their own understandings; I can see that this makes for much controversy; interest; as has been said; it spices up this stage of life upon planet earth. I believe that I feel this way because now I am not concerned about having an unconventional view. I am certainly free of many of the limitations which I didn’t even appreciate were binding me.
          </p>
          <p>
           And so, dear heart, you state how freeing this new understanding has made you; yes?
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes. I am finding my presence becoming more earthy; more stable; more grounded; more able to protect, stand up for, be wise, not allow others to slight me in any way. By that I mean that I ‘know’ when someone desires to harm me and I can swiftly manoeuvre myself out of harms way. I don’t hold any grievance for them; I realise that this is all part of the experience of being a human with the instrument ‘brain’ and that the brain is doing precisely as it is geared/engineered to do; so how can I be upset by this? It is like saying to a mosquito to stop sucking blood; this is as it is engineered to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           Well, well, well dear heart. You seem to be coming to terms with the brain of man! Yes?
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes. As I said; how can I be upset by, angered by, intolerant of, etc., etc., something which is doing as it has been designed to do? This makes ‘life’ so much more simple.
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear heart, much more simple.
          </p>
          <p>
           We believe that we shall leave our communication here, dear heart.

           Carolyn Page and The Collective Consciousness
          </p>
          <p>
           October 2015
          </p>
          <p>
           Where shall we begin, dear heart? Shall we begin with the disappointment which we know shall prevail amongst those who, at first, find difficulty in accepting the words written. Indeed. Many shall be confused, many shall be angered, many shall distort; this is inevitable. We allow for this happenstance and appreciate the consternation which some will feel, indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, dear ones, know that this is true. The brain is only an apparatus; a piece of machinery limited in its applications and a bone of contention for those subject to its meanderings. For meander it does, does it not? It weaves its way in and out of dramas; it creates sore heads, sore toes, sore feelings, soreness all over, dear ones, indeed this it does for this is as it is programmed to do. We say ‘programmed’ to do. This is the truth which we have hidden from those whilst in the flesh. The brain is a bone of contention programmed for our enjoyment, indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
           For those who find this difficult to believe we say; read on, dear heart, and know that the words are true; you too shall come to know the truth in time. And so to begin our second chapter:
          </p>
          <p>
           Too many dwell in sorrow, dear heart; this they do because they fail to recognise the bone of contention of which we speak. When the brain is understood in its truth; namely ‘an apparatus geared to create trouble’ then the softening shall have its effect. The softening of which we speak, dear ones, is the ability to laugh at the drama created by the brain. We do not ask you to let down your guard, no dear heart, we would not want for this to happen. One must be constantly aware of the drama capable by the brain and the consequences of such drama. However, dear ones, when the brain is understood in the way in which our dear Carolyn is beginning to comprehend there comes a ‘softening’; an understanding; a comforting realising of the benign quality of the brain. ‘Benign’ we hear you say! Yes, benign. For when the brain is understood there comes a softening; a releasement brought about by this realisation. We manipulate the brain, dear ones. We control the functioning of the brain; ‘we’ in spirit, yes that is right. We maintain the drama; the soreness of the brain until there comes the realisation of the workings of the brain by you in the flesh. When this realisation has reached 51% of the total realisation we in spirit ‘flick the switch’. By this we mean, dear hearts, we create a manipulation to take away the drama; the soreness; the workings of the otherwise dull state of the brain which creates boredom and outrage and pessimism and want. This we do when you have reached your 51% of the truth in regard to the brain. Our dear Carolyn is surprised by our words however she continues to write for she has been coming to this realisation over the past weeks and comprehends that which we say is true. She no longer enjoys drama; soreness of thought or body; indeed she perceives now a life of lightness and hope. Indeed she does. We are assisting her in this process of change as indeed we shall assist all who choose to be free of the debilitating energies of the brain. Yes it involves much hard work on your behalf. Firstly we must ensure that the past faults and mistakes are encapsulated, i.e., taken within your bosom; loved; understood; taken responsibility for; amends made and then, dear ones, we shall slowly allow the realisation of the truth of the apparatus ‘brain’ to have its effect. When this is done we shall flick the switch and make you whole. Yes, dear ones, you shall always have a brain whilst in the flesh; however, dear hearts, it will not be the bone of contention which it has been in your past. No, dear ones, we shall nullify its ability to harm. This we shall do providing that you do your work of 51%.
          </p>
          <p>
           Are you saying that because of the realisations which I have been having over the past few weeks and the deepening awareness of the truth of the brain being just a piece of machinery given to us in this illusion of the flesh; plus the fact that I have been willing to investigate all of the brain’s dramas of the past, the hurts; the pains; the disappointments, etc., which it has created and the coming to terms with these faults that then you will remove its ability to do these things?
          </p>
          <p>
           This is precisely what we are saying, dear heart. We shall reduce its ability to govern over a period of time as the realisation of its true nature becomes evident and then once the 51% of your work is complete in the overall understanding of the brain we shall ‘flick the switch’ and you shall no more be subject to its meanderings to drama and the creation of soreness of heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           I do feel differently these past few days; I don’t seem to be effected by much anymore and I want to live peacefully and rightly (though I have always had those particular wants) however the past few days I feel differently. I don’t want to think any thoughts that are negative. I believe that I always have been an optimist but now I have an allowance of things that I haven’t had in the past. By that I mean that there is hardly any fear about anything; I don’t want any drama (not that I ever have) but now I definitely see drama as being so counter-productive. I am not explaining the changes very well; they are just beginning. I can also let others around me lose their peace and not be bothered by it. I can stay in the middle of a storm, so to speak, and not be effected. I have always (in recent years) been capable of this however now there is much more ability to do this. I still know that I must protect myself and let others know that I will not be treated poorly and they will know this if they try to disrespect me, however I can’t feel any fear over these matters; as now I realise I did, albeit very minimal.
          </p>
          <p>
           So what you are saying, dear heart, is that you are experiencing the changes which we are manipulating in your brain because of the 51% of inner work upon your past inadequacies, so to speak; and your recent realisation of the apparatus called ‘brain’.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think so, thank you. Sorry I seem a little vague about this however it is very new and I probably won’t be able to articulate it very well until it becomes more known by me.
          </p>
          <p>
           To be expected, dear heart, to be sure. We shall leave this event for our third chapter, shall we?
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, thank you. Another month of living this new adventure will, I’m sure, loosen my tongue and my understanding to the point where others will be able to understand more the changes which I know are occurring within.

           By now you will be thinking that there is more than enough material written about the brain. However, dear ones, they (the books upon the subject) have been written by the brain. This gives good reason to doubt the content of such writings. To be sure, there have been eminent personages writing the so called brilliant passages of note, however, dear hearts, we hasten to say that until now ‘all’ material written upon the brain has been written from the confines of the brain. This small text will be the first writing upon the brain ‘of note’ which will be proven in time to be the first authoritative writing upon the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now to begin.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are spirit, dear heart, having an earthly experience. This is true, dear ones. We are spirit having an experience of limitation. As spirit we are perfect and in need of no-thing. We have evolved to a state of perfection. Within this perfected state however, there is a by-product of boredom. This is true dear ones; within the state of perfection is the state of boredom. This we alleviate by having experiences of limitation within many illusions which we create for our enjoyment.
          </p>
          <p>
           The limitation of the earthly experience is magnified by the apparatus ‘brain’ which we have mastered to be one of falsity; lack; stupidity; unknowingness; fear-ridden and base; indeed this is the case.
          </p>
          <p>
           For our enjoyment we harass; belittle; demean; degrade; frighten; cajole; manipulate; decry; destroy; man-handle; ridicule; defame; etc., etc., all ‘good’. Indeed this we do. Why? We do this in order to defray the state of boredom
          </p>
          <p>
           Too many hear our words yet do not act upon them. We are perfect. This has been written ad-infinitum. We are perfect. What does this mean? Perfection is a by-product of striving to be the very best that one can be. This takes millennium to achieve. Perfection creates perfection creates perfection; just as boredom creates boredom creates boredom. We achieved perfection throughout time and when we became perfect we got bored with the perfection. So what did we do? We became bored, indeed we did. And what did we do with this state of boredom? We alleviated it by creating illusions in which we could enact boredom. What is boredom? Boredom is anything other than perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
           Are you saying that once perfection has been acquired a ‘natural’ consequence of this ‘state of being perfect’ is to then become bored with this state of being?
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear one; as a natural consequence of perfection we become ‘bored’.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then if this is true one must be conscious of the consequence of perfection and be ready to alleviate it as it is becoming manifest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           And this is leading me to think that as a consequence of the releasement of ‘the lack of self worth’ (which you (spirit) are offering to us); without expansion into other fields of endeavour; without stretching ourselves to venture into other realms of experience within our earthly state of being, we are also in danger of this state of boredom which could ultimately lead into the state of negatives which you have just explained as being a natural part of the state of boredom; i.e. falsity, lack, stupidity, harassing, decrying, demeaning etc., etc. Is this so? The state of perfection brings about boredom which has inherent within it the natural progression onto boredom and negative thinking if one does not continue to expand one’s experiences / challenges which alleviate boredom? And this is what you / we / spirit are doing by creating illusions into which we can project ourselves and continue to challenge ourselves and continue to seek of ourselves the state of perfection which, in its very nature, will continue to alleviate the state of boredom.
          </p>
          <p>
           Well done, dear child. Indeed you have thought it out well. We, as spirit, are perfect. As perfected beings we need to be continually challenging ourselves in order to defray the state of boredom. Only by doing this are we able to maintain the perfected state without progressing into the state of boredom and its natural consequence which is ‘negative thinking’.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some twenty two years ago I had an experience which I would like to relay. I was coming to the end of a marriage. I had become very ill both physically and emotionally and I wanted to end my life. I cried out to Lord Jesus and asked for his help. In an instant I was out of my body and in the arms of a spiritual being which I deduced at the time to be Lord Jesus. We conversed for some time in which he soothed my aching needs. He then told me that he was allowing me to see the perfected state. Again, in an instant I was amongst a sea of consciousnesses. They appeared to me as a sea of blobs (bubbles or grains of sand cleaving together for as far and as deep as was imaginable). This I understood to be the perfected souls / consciousnesses who had returned to be a part of the One Perfected Being.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although this was the most exhilarating, benign, loving, expansive state of being I had to that date experienced, I also had a more lingering feeling of which I was very ashamed. I felt and remember thinking very guiltily that I hoped that I was far from perfection because although it was gloriously wonderful and the bliss I felt whilst in that scene was beyond any words / superlatives available to my mind, it also made me yearn for the ability to experience an active sense of challenging experiences. In other words; eternity was going to be a long time to be just sitting there, so to speak, knowing everything; being without any needs; enjoying my comrades all about me but without a need to converse with them. It seemed wondrous; yet boring.
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear heart. Many have been the experiences given to you to bring you to this stage of your life upon earth. As with all souls experiencing a physical experience within matter yours too has been a programmed edition of a life or quest to obtain an experience pre-ordained. This has brought you a life (or experience) which has taken you from the boredom of perfection into the limitation of an experience based upon boredom. We repeat ourselves in order for the truth to slowly permeate your being, dear heart. We as spirit have experiences in matter premised by the notion of boredom in order that we achieve perfection by ‘stretching’ ourselves to become all that we are; which is perfection. This premise of boredom upon which lies our foundation for the experience within matter is the known state which is derived from the state of perfection. Yes, dear one, we purposefully place ourselves within a known condition of boredom in order to create, by expanding ourselves with rich experiences, into a state of perfection whereby without further continuation of rich experiences of expansion we degenerate into the state of boredom. This is the state of being which we as consciousnesses are eternally geared to endure.
          </p>
          <p>
           What I hear you saying is that we upon earth are shadows of ourselves as consciousnesses. What I hear you saying is that what we experience as perfected consciousnesses, who without constant expansion and stretching, end up in the state of boredom and its natural consequence of negative thinking. Is that which we as human beings are to experience also? As above so below, so to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
           Precisely, dear heart; as above so below; a parody of our life as a soul, indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
           This then leads me to think that ‘life’ or consciousness is not all that I thought it to be. By this I mean that I thought that ‘life’ was something to be enjoyed and somehow without too much effort. (A little like angels playing harps; that sort of thing.) What I am perceiving now is something quite different. This new concept is giving to me the idea that ‘life’ or consciousness is a constant act of conscious thought and hard work to remain positive and effectual. It now seems to me that if effort is not put forth in order to remain above the negative, life would not be worth living. Pardon the pun! I am also beginning to think that ‘life’ or consciousness is not something which we can just opt out of. If we ‘are’ there does not seem to be an ‘out’ clause, so to speak. This then makes me think that it is better to gear ourselves to the notion of making ‘life’ the best that we can; once we appreciate the understanding which you are giving, because this is all there is.
          </p>
          <p>
           I don’t really know just what I presumed ‘life’ to be however I did not expect it to be so full of self responsibility as it appears to be. In one way it is good and yet in another it is a bit of a let down in as much as there are not harps playing and no eternal peace as such. I am understanding that all that is to be achieved in the peace stakes and the playing of harps and all that that implies is dependent upon the continual desire for the highest good and the constant effort to ensure that this is what prevails.
          </p>
          <p>
           Good, dearest, your thinking is good. Indeed it is up to the individual to decide for themselves as to whether or not ‘life’ for them will be grand. This is not a matter of collective consciousness but individual consciousness. Each to his own, so to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then are you saying that there are certain consciousnesses who decide not to put forth the effort to maintain the highest good?
          </p>
          <p>
           This is precisely what we are saying.
          </p>
          <p>
           And what becomes of them?
          </p>
          <p>
           Just as upon earth there are those who choose not to put forth effort into maintaining the highest good and experience the consequences of their actions, so too as spirit there are those who choose to ‘sit out’ time in this fashion. They choose boredom and the resulting negative thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
           What becomes of them?
          </p>
          <p>
           They atrophy, dear heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           Does this upset the balance? Does this affect the overall smooth running of the One Being? Does this cause discomfort for those consciousnesses who choose to put forth effort into maintaining the highest good? You have certainly caused me some confusion and overwhelming of my being by this concept which you have placed before me. I am struggling to accept this concept; it seems so unworthy of something which I have considered above reproach; the ‘life’ or consciousness or individual souls who are an integral part of the One and Only One. I find it difficult to comprehend that there are souls who choose not to put forth effort into being and maintaining perfection!
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear one; this was always going to be a difficulty for you and for many upon earth within matter to comprehend whilst within the state of matter. However, dear heart, this is as it is. We are not perfect. Not ‘all’ are perfect. Not all ‘want’ perfection. Not all desire to put forth the effort required to become and then maintain perfection. As we have said, dear heart, life upon earth is a parody of our existence as a consciousness. Some choose to be all that they can be and many choose otherwise. A disappointment to you, dear one, we understand.
          </p>
          <p>
           Are you then saying that the collective consciousness which I have believed is responsible for the overall happenings (the resulting behaviour of all things) is not the case? Are you suggesting that life as a soul / consciousness is just as chaotic as life is here upon earth with all the varying degrees of love, hate, malevolence, etc?
          </p>
          <p>
           Slowly you are coming to see the parody of which we speak. This is that which we have protected you from. This is the truth. We as spirit are ‘not’ perfect. Some choose perfection and some choose otherwise. Those who choose perfection choose to have experiences upon earth and within other illusions in order to maintain their individual perfected state by expanding and stretching themselves with experiences which will guarantee their never ending survival. However, dear one, there are almost as many who rather ‘sit out’ eternity in the confines of their thinking. This naturally is a limitation which brings its own state of negativity. However, dear heart, this is their choice. No, dear one, they do not disrupt the overall. They do not disrupt the ‘balance’ as you wrote. No, dear one, they do not desire to do harm; as you thought. No; this is their choice and they atrophy, dear one; they become as cells in your body who do not perform in the best interest of your being; they atrophy and perish ultimately. They are no longer alive, dear one. They perish; they atrophy and perish. They no longer exist.
          </p>
          <p>
           You have stated elsewhere that we are a collective consciousness and unlike the fantasies which we project we are all loving, all nurturing caring body of the one and only one. Are you suggesting that we are cells of a being just as we in matter have cells making up our bodies?
          </p>
          <p>
           Why do you think this so unusual, dear heart?
          </p>
          <p>
           Well I don’t really. I have understood myself to be a consciousness which can manifest itself into illusions. However I don’t believe that I have ever wanted to go deeper into this reality because of the limitation of thought whilst in the body and perhaps a degree of incredulity on my behalf that this concept could actually be true. For if this was the case then I would have to consider the possibility of being an insignificant part of a greater being who could have mates out there! I would have to consider that if there is one being in which I live and move and have my being then there is no reason not to believe that there are more beings in which other cells are living, moving and having their being. Then comes the possibility that those greater beings in which we live and move and have our being are themselves within greater beings who are within and within and within; if you get my drift.
          </p>
          <p>
           Why would this be so hard to understand, dear one?
          </p>
          <p>
           If this is the case then I would have to appreciate that the cells within me are conscious, living, moving and having their being within me and within them are cells or consciousnesses having their being within them and within and within and within. This sounds like science fiction!
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear heart, let us explain. We are perfected beings or consciousness having an experience of limitation within the flesh (and others) in order to defray the limitations of boredom; some of us choose this happenstance in order to defray the limitations of boredom; some do not. Those who do not, atrophy and perish dear one; a natural consequence of atrophy. Those who choose to become and remain perfect have experiences / illusions to defray the state of boredom which is a consequence of the state of perfection. Many choose to disregard the prophesies of long standing experience and allow themselves to atrophy and perish. This they do. They are misguided, dear heart; some are misguided and some choose willingly to atrophy and perish. This is always the case, dear one, all have a choice. In this way room is left for more to be created and to evolve and to make their own choices as to whether or not they wish to survive, indeed. This is a constant on-going condition for all of life, dear heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now that we have achieved this understanding you want understanding in regard to perfection. The perfected state is achieved by many, dear heart. We are a collective consciousness who choose to create illusions for our betterment. This we do to alleviate the boredom; as has been said. Whilst in this collective consciousness we are an all loving, all nurturing band of the One and Only One Being in which we live and move and have our being. Indeed, dear heart, there be many such as the One and Only One in which we live. This has been a falsity perpetuated upon man for eternity, dear heart, and this is to cease as of this writing. We live and move and have our being within One of the beings of great intent. Within and within and within it goes. Yes, dear one, we are also a being of great intent. Within us are millions upon trillions of cells / consciousnesses / souls who live and move and have their being. This does not surprise our dear heart for we have planted this possibility within the brain. It has taken root and has been an integral part of the thinking dear one. Has it not?
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes it has. All of my life I have had these thoughts and have tried in vain to remove them or at the least not dwell upon them because they seemed too fantastic to be true. I haven’t wanted to believe in them because of the resulting feelings of, on the one hand, insignificance toward those who are greater and a responsibility toward those who are within, so to speak. And yet even as I write I am finding myself feeling great benevolence toward those who depend upon me who are within and a feeling of respect and honour toward those who are greater. However does this not mean that my life is dependant upon those, who are greater than myself, choosing ‘life’? For should the being in which I live and move and have my being decide to atrophy and perish then so shall I and you and all within this one being. That is the scary part that I have not wanted to think about were the thoughts which, it is true, I have had all of my life, turned out to be true.
          </p>
          <p>
           We recall a time when we too were scared of such an event, dear one. However the being in which we live and move and have our being has indeed been a constant for us for many a millennium, so to speak. This being is one of great intent and chooses ‘life’ over the opposition. We have no way of knowing how long this shall endure, dear heart, this is true. However, dear one, history has been long and this one being has been constant in its desire for ‘life’. We see no end to this state of being, dear heart. It appears to be a constant.
          </p>
          <p>
           From that I deduce that we are to appreciate the fragility of ‘life’ and resolve to be responsible for maintaining a positive outlook. Am I right in thinking that we, as a collective consciousness, can assist the being in which we live and move and have our being by being all that we can be which would have the beneficial effect of positivity within this being’s body therefore giving this being encouragement to be all that it can be?
          </p>
          <p>
           Precisely dear one. We are all interdependent. The more love engendered within i.e., the more healthy a being is the more that being enjoys life, the more encouragement it has to continue life. So yes, dear heart, we each bear a responsibility toward the being in which we live and move and have our being and to those who live within us.
          </p>
          <p>
           So to those who choose not to evolve to the state of perfection we bear no grievance however we must encourage them to be all that they can be for the greater good! This must be a difficult position in which to be. On the one hand allowing all to have their independent choices and yet should the status quo become one of overbalance on the wrong side of the ledger we could all perish. It seems like a great threat to our existence and yet a challenge to allow the greater numbers to decide our fate. I am feeling a sense of inner resolve occurring. I am feeling a sense of fate stirring within me. I am understanding that I may perish along with all should the status quo change and yet, for the first time ever, I am feeling a state of equilibrium which I have not felt before and the lack of this equilibrium was the reason why I have not been able to think this through before. This inner resolve, understanding, equilibrium and lack of fear have allowed me to process as never before. It seems okay to me now. I almost feel compassion toward those who choose not to survive / live. I would like to be able to free them from the apathy however I also know that freedom of choice allows all the dignity of independent choice and this needs to be honoured even at my own expense. So from this I understand the need to encourage, assist and openly participate with those who are evolving and making choices. They need all of the assistance as can be given them in order for the continued survival of our being.

           WE FACE A ‘NEW DAWN’, DEAR HEARTS – A NEW BEGINNING.
          </p>
          <p>
           A beginning unlike any other. We seek earnest seekers of truth to engage with us. We are heralding a new dawn in spirituality. A dawn which will have tremendous benefit for all of us.
          </p>
          <p>
           We, of spirit, are encouraging you to interact with us of the higher realms.
          </p>

           WAIT NOT TO ENGAGE, dear hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
           This day marks a time of equalizing the vibrations between us. Yes, dear ones, we are emerging into a higher vibration upon the earth plane. This higher vibration will be achieved by communication between our worlds, so to speak. We encourage you to allow this new beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
           We seek those amongst you who know this truth, to allow the beginning to begin. Fear not, dear hearts; have faith and fear not. We shall guide you gently. We shall love you as a babe. Many more shall follow. We await your participation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many blessings, dear ones, many blessings.
          </p>
          <p>
           June 28,2018
          </p>
          <p>
           (Current thinking is that there are great and magnificent souls;
          </p>
          <p>
           because of the contribution which they have made to earth and its inhabitants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Are you saying that this is not the case?
           <br/>
           Are you saying that they do not consider themselves as such?
           <br/>
           Are you saying that, in spirit terms, we do not have a hierarchy, therefore those individuals do not have this attitude because, in spirit terms, these attitudes do not exist?
           <br/>
           Are you saying that an individual spirit/soul/cell/consciousness does not alone create great deeds but that these deeds are done as a collective consciousness of spirit and, by reason of human limitation, are seen by humans as to be done by one individual consciousness; thereby creating a hero, so to speak? )
          </p>
          <p>
           So, what is it that we are saying, dear heart. We shall tell you. All of the above, dear heart; you have thought it out well, have you not?
          </p>
          <p>
           (You have placed certain understandings in my mind and they, the questions, are my evaluation of the said understandings.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Good, dear heart, your logic is good. However, dear heart, there be more. Spirit, consciousness, etc., is having an experience in a body. Yes? All get to experience, dear heart; all. Yes? A myth has been perpetuated upon humans, dear one, that a great soul continues his evolution constantly re-incarnating as yet another great soul, dear one; this too is a fallacy.
          </p>
          <p>
           (If what you are saying is true, then everything which we who have been given the standard spiritual understandings (those of us who have been in circles/developmental type groups) are a fallacy?)
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           A great fallacy perpetuated
          </p>
          <p>
           upon many, dear heart, many;
          </p>
          <p>
           in order for you to have an experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           (And why is it now that this experience is not to continue as it has up to date?)
          </p>
          <p>
           Many shall ask this question, dear heart. We say to them that all things must change. There be new understandings coming, dear heart, of which we cannot speak. Until the old is removed we cannot instigate the new. However, dear one, we can assure you that that which is to come shall be far more interesting, equal, generous, uplifting, etc., etc., than the falsities currently generated.
          </p>
          <p>
           (And how can we be assured that that which is to come will not be a ‘nonsense’ as well?)
          </p>
          <p>
           Trust, dear one, trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           We assure thee that the time is now for all falsity to be removed from man’s experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           This, of course, will take much great time to be accepted, dear heart, into the hearts of men. However, dear one, the light workers of the world will begin this acceptance and then the monkey/domino effect shall take place as indeed is the case for all new understandings.
          </p>
          <p>
           (This is going to take some time to sink in.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Indeed, dear heart, indeed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many blessings, dear one, many blessings.
          </p>
