    ID3 Tagging in Python
   </h1>
   <p>
    This module allows one to read and manipulate so-called
    <a href="http://www.id3.org/">
     ID3
     informational tags
    </a>
    on MP3 files through an object-oriented
    <a href="http://www.python.org/">
     Python
    </a>
    interface. Note that this is the first thing I've ever written in
     Python, so please bear with me if I've done something atrociously
     wrong.
   </p>
   <p>
    This module is
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/id3-py/">
     hosted on SourceForge.net
    </a>
    .  Please visit the project page there.

   <p>
    Version History:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     1.2 (05 April 2002): New dictionary-based interface to ID3
         fields.  Changed id3-tagger.py and examples to use new
         interface.  Changed default genre to 255 (Unknown), not 0 (Blues).
    </li>
    <li>
     1.1 (08 November 2001): This release was long delayed, mostly because
         I forgot to do it.  Fixes Windows issues by opening files in binary mode,
         as well as a few other buglets.
    </li>
    <li>
     1.0 (21 September 2000): ID3v1.1 (track number) support based on
 	patches from Jim Speth (speth@end.com) and another party whose
 	email I seem to have lost. (Sorry about that!) First 1.0 release;
 	added README, COPYING, and CHANGES files. Added setup.py file
 	for Distutils and Python 1.6 users. Now automatically chops
 	whitespace and trailing nulls off the ends of ID3 fields.
    </li>
    <li>
     0.6 (11 June 1999): Fix from Arne Zellentin (arne@unix-ag.org) to 
 	prevent wiping out the last 128 bytes of MP3 files that don't already 
 	have an ID3 tag. Oops!
    </li>
    <li>
     0.5 (2 May 1999): Initial release.
    </li>
   </ul>

    Here is a simple example of using the ID3 module. See the module
       itself for more documentation. This example sets the title and
       artist fields on an MP3 file.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <pre>
 	from ID3 import *
 	try:
 	  id3info = ID3('/some/file/moxy.mp3')
 	  print id3info
 	  id3info['TITLE'] = "Green Eggs and Ham"
 	  id3info['ARTIST'] = "Moxy Fr√ºvous"
           for k, v in id3info.items():
             print k, ":", v
         except InvalidTagError, message:
           print "Invalid ID3 tag:", message
        </pre>
   <p>
    I have written another small example program,
    <a href="ID3/id3-tagger.py">
     id3-tagger.py
    </a>
    , which can print out
       the ID3 tags, formatted nicely, of all the files specified
       as arguments to the program. It can also set any field on
       the MP3 file, including the genre field, which can be set either
       by number or by name. It's included in
    <a href="ID3.tar.gz">
     the
 	main distribution
    </a>
    .

    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/python-id3">
     Debian GNU/Linux packages of ID3.py

    are available in the main Debian distribution.
