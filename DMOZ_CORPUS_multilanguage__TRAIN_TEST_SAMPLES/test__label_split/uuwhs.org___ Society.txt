 Formal Meeting Announcement for Members of Unitarian Universalist Women's Heritage Society at General Assembly<br />

 <p>Dear Members and Friends of UUWHS;</p>
 <p>You have not heard from us in a long time.  We apologize for the lack of communication. We have been in a prolonged transition that has resulted in our need to contact all of our supporters.  We'd like to provide an overview of the last few years that has led us to an important decision.  </p>
 <p>In the fall of 2006, Joan Goodwin unexpectedly died.  Joan had been a long time supporter, friend and pivotal component of UUWHS.  Her death rocked our organization.  The board was able to regroup and over the next two years publish  "Unitarian and Universalist Women: Liberating History." </p>
 <p>In 2007 the UUA reduced the number of independent affiliate organizations projecting UUWHS and a significant number of other affiliates into reflection on mission and purpose.  UUWHS had been collaborating with Unitarian Universalist Historical Society already, sharing display space at General Assemblies, so we took our relationship to a new level and formed the Partners in Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage in 2009 along with two other history organizations, UU Religious Education History Group and Universalist Heritage Foundation.  Our first project was the successful History Convocation in October of 2010 in Massachusetts.  It was held in cooperation with UU Collegium, Andover Harvard Theological Library and Universalist Heritage Tours. </p>
 <p>Producing this conference was a wonderful experience, we look forward to doing more.  However, the board of UUWHS is down to three people and one past president advisor.  During the History Convocation the four of us met with several previous board members as well as our founder, Dorothy Emerson.  We invited stories about UUWHS  and thoughts about the future of the organization.  Due to a significant drop in availability of volunteer time, we all agreed that it was time to seriously evaluate the existence of UUWHS.  Dorothy Emerson voiced out loud what had been on many of our minds: consolidating with UUHS.</p>
 <p>The board of UUWHS approached the board of UUHS about consolidating our two organizations.  During a combined board conference call in January of 2011, it was decided that a consolidation would enhance the integrity of both organizations, and would help support our mutual missions.  To that effect, a new set of bylaws is being created that would fully support both organizations, paying particular attention to the needs of women's heritage.  </p>
 <p>The proposed new bylaws would create a portfolio board of directors with at least one portfolio designated as women's heritage.  In addition, any remaining UUWHS funds  would be designated for the purpose of UU women's heritage. All UUWHS and UUHS Life Members will maintain their status as Life Members. The name of the consolidated organization is proposed as Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage Society. </p>
 <p>The Board's of both UUWHS and UUHS feel confident in this important next step for our organizations.  We have enjoyed working together over the past few years and particularly over the past few months.  Our goals and love for UU history and heritage are in alignment.</p>
 <p>Massachusetts state law requires that 2/3 majority of current members vote approval for the consolidation, thus we must limit voting to current paid members for fiscal year 2011.  In order to accomplish the consolidation we need to hear from as many current UUWHS members as possible. Our bylaws prohibit proxy votes.</p>
 <p>Many of you would like to know about our library.  It is still located at Bethany Union in Boston. The library has been kept up to date thanks to the work of Helen Zidowecki.  We have been looking for a new location and are hopeful to find a long term home for our archives and books where the collection will be taken care of in perpetuity. </p>
 <p>If you have questions please feel free to contact any of us. </p>

 <p>
 The Unitarian Universalist Women's Heritage Society was founded in 1988 (as the Women's History Publication Project) by one woman with a vision and a small group of supportive colleagues with funding from the Unitarian Universalist Association and private donations. The Society seeks to recover and preserve the stories of UU women's lives so that future generations can be inspired by their wisdom and courage, celebrating the valuable gifts we have received from our Universalist and Unitarian foremothers.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The UUWHS is one of the founders of <b><a href="Announcing_a_New_Partnership--Press Release--May_2009--RTF.rtf">Partners for Unitarian Universalist History and

 			Society was founded in 1988 (as the Women's History Publication
 			Project) by one woman with a vision and a small group of
 			supportive colleagues with funding from the Unitarian Universalist
 			Association and private donations. The Society seeks to recover
 			and preserve the stories of UU women's lives so that future
 			generations can be inspired by their wisdom and courage,
 			celebrating the valuable gifts we have received from our
 			Universalist and Unitarian foremothers.</span>
