          Retail Handyman was started with the idea of servicing the retail industry and their outlets for the smaller everyday tasks that needed to be performed in order to make their stores look good. We are growing at the request of our clients to handle larger projects as we have proven we can deliver cost effectively and on time. We can now deliver full service facility maintenance services from the edge of your property line to the top of your roof.
